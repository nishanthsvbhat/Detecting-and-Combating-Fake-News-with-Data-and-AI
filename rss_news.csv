House of Commons

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has decided against raising income tax rates at the Budget later this month. In recent weeks, Reeves had given strong indications she would increase the tax - a move that would have broken Labour's election manifesto promise not to raise ""the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax"". However, as first reported in the Financial Times, the chancellor has decided against taking the step, partly due to better-than-expected economic forecasts. Instead of raising income tax rates, the chancellor could opt to freeze or lower income tax thresholds, the salary levels at which the various rates kick in. Other taxes could also be raised.

Government sources maintain that they are still having to make what they call ""tough choices"". They also stress that the move was not related to the turbulence in recent days relating to the prime minister's future. Ahead of every Budget, the chancellor submits their plans to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which then make forecasts on whether the government will spend more money than it raises and whether the economy will grow or shrink. A proposal to increase income tax rates was sent to the OBR as an option earlier this month to be costed, to help fill what was then a £30bn gap in the public finances, mainly caused by a downgrade to productivity. Newer assessments from the OBR appear to have increased the projected strength of wages and tax receipts in the coming years and offset several billion pounds of that gap, taking it closer to £20bn. Government borrowing costs initially rose in reaction to the reports but fell back after further reports that the financial hole would not be as big as first thought.

Chancellors never comment publicly on what will be in their Budgets but do prepare the ground - also known as ""pitch rolling"" - for any big changes that might be coming. And in the months running up to this year's financial statement, Labour ministers have repeatedly given strong indications that income tax rates would go up. In October, the prime minister declined to repeat his previous promises not to increase key taxes, despite being asked to do so by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at Prime Minister's Questions. Earlier this month, Reeves took the unusual step of making a pre-Budget speech to warn about the need for ""necessary choices"" and said everyone would have to ""contribute"". And on Monday, she told BBC Radio 5 live: ""It would, of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending."" If the chancellor has decided not to increase income tax rates, she will have to explore other ways to raise money, in order to meet her self-imposed rules on debt and borrowing while filling a hole in the public finances of around £20bn. She could still opt to extend a freeze on income tax and National Insurance (NI) thresholds. The freeze was introduced in April 2023 and was due to expire in 2028. An extension of the freeze would not break the strict letter of the manifesto promise but would mean income tax bills go up for some, as more people would be pulled above the income threshold at which point they either start paying tax and NI or qualify for higher tax rates. It would also mean Reeves reversing her stance from last year's Budget, when she told MPs: ""I have come to the conclusion that extending the threshold freeze would hurt working people. It would take more money out of their payslips."" ""From 2028-29, personal tax thresholds will be uprated in line with inflation once again."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates extending the freeze by two years could raise £8.3bn a year and would mean someone on the minimum wage would be liable to pay income tax if they worked just 18 hours a week. Another option would be to lower the thresholds which would raise more money than simply extending the freeze. There have been reports the Treasury is also considering other measures including a new tax on electric vehicles and higher taxes on gambling companies.

In its 2024 general election manifesto, Labour promised that it would ""not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, or VAT"". Breaking the manifesto promise would mean difficult questions for Labour ministers and MPs ahead of elections in Scotland, Wales and England. At the start of the month, the party's newly-elected deputy leader Lucy Powell, said: ""It is really important we stand by the promises that we were elected on and that we do what we said we would do."" Health Secretary Wes Streeting said it was ""really important that we keep our promises and that we stand by our manifesto"". He added that talk about tax rises demonstrated how ""challenging"" the situation in public finances was, but that it was ""wise to stop speculating"" and ""wait for the Budget"". Kemi Badenoch said: ""It's good if they aren't going to increase income taxes, but the truth is they shouldn't be increasing any taxes at all. ""I've never seen a government do this in the run up to a budget. I have never seen this level of chaos, this level of irresponsibility."" ""Reeves must guarantee no new taxes on work, businesses, homes or pensions - and she should go further by abolishing stamp duty."" Liberal Democrat Business spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: ""The chancellor gave a press conference to trail her income tax hikes. ""She must come before the British public today, unroll that particular pitch and come clean on what on earth is going on at the Treasury."" The SNP social justice secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said the UK government was in ""complete disarray"". A Downing Street spokesman did not comment on whether income tax would rise but said: ""The chancellor was very clear about addressing the challenges this country faces and her priorities in addressing those challenges – all of that stands. ""One of the objectives of the budget is to build more resilient public finances with the headroom to withstand global turbulence and to give businesses the confidence to invest.""",2025-11-14T15:05:15.864824

Watch: Doctors' strike 'completely irresponsible' says health secretary

Doctors going on strike again over pay is ""inflicting pain and misery"" on patients, says Health Secretary Wes Streeting. ""We could do without this reckless action,"" he said, adding it could harm patients. The five-day walkout in England by resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors, runs until 07:00 Wednesday. The doctors' union - the British Medical Association (BMA) - says they are still not paid enough and there are too few training places or jobs. The NHS says nearly all services will keep running, and patients should attend appointments unless advised otherwise. Hospitals will come under the most strain - resident doctors make up about half their medical workforce.

NHS England says it wanted to keep 95% of non-urgent work, such as hip and knee operations, going. The NHS aims to do this by re-deploying and offering overtime to consultants and and other senior doctors as well as relying on those not striking – around a third of resident doctors are not BMA members. But this will come at significant cost with the NHS estimating the five-day walkout is costing £240m to cover.

Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Nick Hulme, the chief executive of East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, said although there would be disruptions for some patients, the impact of the strike would be ""at a minimum"" because of staff being moved around. He also said more resident doctors were choosing to work during this strike: ""They are voting with their feet and returning to work."" Dr Tom Dolphin, BMA council chairman, said the union had ""reached an impasse"" with the government over pay and jobs. ""We've got pay that is still a fifth down on the value that it had in 2008,"" he said, adding there are ""thousands of doctors who are unable to get into training posts, are unable to become the specialists and the GPs of the future that we need"". Mr Hulme said his trust was ""working very hard"" to make sure resident doctors were being provided with ""good advance notice of rotas"" and were not being expected to travel great distances to work. But he said their pay was a matter for the government and the BMA. Meanwhile, resident doctors in Scotland are balloting for strike action over pay.

'I'm furious'

Other

Despite the attempt to keep services going, patients like Colette Houlihan, 68, have still had to face postponements. She was due to have a pre-surgery appointment on Monday, but this has now been pushed back to late December. Ms Houlihan, from Cambridgeshire, who is waiting for a benign tumour in her neck to be removed, said she had had to put up with two cancellations already, but could understand those as she was told patients who were higher priorities needed to be seen. ""They could have had cancer. I didn't mind that, but this is different. ""I am furious. By striking they ignore the Hippocratic Oath - first and foremost do no harm. ""Striking causes harm by way of delaying procedures, taking senior doctors from their posts and causing chaos within the system,"" she said.

Challenging

NHS England medical director Prof Meghana Pandit said it was frustrating and disappointing that there was another round - the 13th - of industrial action at a challenging time for the NHS, with flu cases rising earlier than usual. ""Despite this, staff across the NHS are working extremely hard to maintain care and limit disruption,"" she added. But BMA leader Dr Tom Dolphin said keeping most services running would be ""challenging"". He said doctors had a legal right to strike and should not be ""bullied or coerced"" into working. And he warned his members would only leave the picket line if there was a major emergency – such as a mass casualty event.

The latest walkout comes after Health Secretary Wes Streeting launched arguably his strongest attack on the BMA. Addressing a conference of health managers this week, he called the union ""morally reprehensible"" and accused it of acting like a cartel, attempting to hold the public and government to ransom. He said doctors had received generous pay rises over the past three years – worth nearly 30%, bringing average basic salaries to just over £54,000. Talks between him and the union broke down last week after the BMA turned down a fresh offer to end the dispute. Streeting has maintained throughout the year that he could not negotiate on pay, but he proposed a deal that would see out-of-pocket expenses like exam fees and membership fees covered, along with a boost in speciality training places. But the BMA has argued that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.

EPA Resident doctors gathered outside the Royal Liverpool University Hospital on Friday morning despite the rainy conditions

The union has also warned doctors are struggling to find jobs at a key stage of their training – between years two and three when they start speciality training. This year there were more than 30,000 applicants for 10,000 jobs at this stage, although some will have been doctors from abroad. ""We need a solution for the jobs crisis, that bottleneck for doctors who are out of permanent work or out of consistent work,"" Dr Emma Runswick, deputy chair of the BMA Council, told the BBC. ""Then we need to be able to retain those doctors throughout their careers by paying them appropriately, and that means restoration of pay."" On the Today programme, the BMA's Tom Dolphin said there was ""a big difference"" between what doctors can earn in the UK, compared to other countries like Ireland, Australia and Canada, ""where salaries can be two, sometimes more times than what they are in the UK"". ""We've got to make sure that we are investing in staff in the UK so we can retain them in the UK and provide specialists and GPs that people need,"" he added. ""We want to negotiate, we want a settlement to this. We don't want to be on strike. We'd much rather be looking after the patients.""

'Astonishingly lethal': James Landale reports from site of deadly Russian strike

A Russian drone has slammed into a block of flats in eastern Kyiv, killing six people and wounding dozens of others, during a wave of strikes throughout the Ukrainian capital. As emergency workers sifted through the wreckage in the Lisovyi area, one Kyiv resident called Vita described how the drone had pierced the building, exploding on the other side. Meanwhile, Ukraine stepped up its attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure, with drone strikes on one of its biggest export terminals in Novorossiysk, on the Black Sea coast. Fire broke out at the Sheskharis oil refinery, and a ship and a block of flats were hit, officials said.

Krasnodar governor Veniamin Kondratyev said three crew members and another man were hurt in the attack which damaged the main oil depot and a container terminal. Mayor Andrei Kravchenko declared a state of emergency and Reuters reported that oil exports were suspended. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine had fired long-range ""Long Neptune"" cruise missiles during its attacks on Russia overnight, without specifying what they targeted.

Reuters Kyiv fire service said the drone destroyed several floors of the entire block of flats

Condemning Russia's overnight attacks as vile and calculated, Zelensky said about 430 drones and 18 missiles had been launched and dozens of high-rise buildings damaged. A drone attack on a market at Chornomorsk in the south of the country killed two people. In Kyiv, residential buildings came under attack ""in practically every district"", the head of the city's military administration Tymur Tkachenko said on Telegram. He issued a warning to take shelter a minute after midnight local time on Thursday night, writing ""it's loud in Kyiv"".

The fire service in the Lisovyi neighbourhood said later the drone had hit the seventh floor of the residential building. When it exploded all the floors - from the eighth down to the fourth - collapsed, a spokesman told the BBC. Vita said she saw four bodies being pulled out of the apartment a few doors down from hers: ""I saw it with my own eyes."" Two cranes hoisted emergency workers outside the block, as crews combed through the destroyed building, throwing broken sections of wall and shattered glass to the ground. Falling debris and fires damaged several high-rise apartment buildings, a hospital, school and administrative buildings, according to emergency services.

More than 40 people were rescued, they added, including 14 from a fire in a residential building. Another person was rescued after being pulled from beneath the rubble, they said. Kyiv's energy infrastructure was badly hit, leaving some buildings in the capital without heat, officials said. ""The attack was massive, with drones, with ballistic [missiles], with lots of air defence working,"" Ukrainian MP Lisa Yasko told the BBC. ""Very often there was the feeling that your bed was just shaking together with the windows."" Medical teams were deployed to all fires, officials said, while Mayor Vitali Klitschko said nine people were being treated in hospital with one man in an ""extremely serious condition"".

Drone video captures the scale of the waste

Fly-tippers have dumped a ""grotesque"" mountain of waste in a field in Oxfordshire. The ""environmental catastrophe unfolding in plain sight"" is up to 150m (490ft) long and 6m (20ft) high and has appeared on a site between the River Cherwell and the A34 near Kidlington. Calum Miller, Liberal Democrat MP for Bicester and Woodstock, has raised the issue in Parliament, saying it was ""threatening an environmental disaster"". He also said Cherwell District Council had estimated the cost of removing the waste would be greater than its entire annual budget.

""This is not a licensed waste site and we can just see the quantity of waste that has been dumped here, that's illegal, so it's criminal,"" Mr Miller said. ""That's not something that local residents and taxpayers can afford."" He says ""criminal gangs are dumping waste on this scale"" across the country and it will take government intervention before pollutants ""leech out"" into local rivers.

Billy Burnell BBC/Jamie Morris The site has been called an ""environmental catastrophe"". BBC reporter Jamie Morris visited the scene and said the mound appeared to be ""20ft high at least"".

Charity Friends of the Thames said the illegal rubbish dump was created about a month ago by an organised crime group. Chief executive Laura Reineke said: ""This is an environmental catastrophe unfolding in plain sight. ""Every day that passes increases the risk of toxic run-off entering the river system, poisoning wildlife and threatening the health of the entire catchment. ""The Environment Agency must act now, not in months or years, which is their usual reaction time."" A restriction order had been put in place by the Environment Agency. It is hard to distinguish any particular bits of waste as it appears to have been shredded with earth mixed in. Some of the rubbish from the top of the pile has toppled and is now only five metres from the river.

Billy Burnell is a local angler who regularly fishes in the area

The River Cherwell is a tributary of the River Thames, which means it flows through Oxford before joining the Thames. Local angler Billy Burnell regularly fishes in the area and said he noticed the pile in September. He called it ""horrific"" and said the potential run-off into the river is an ""environmental disaster waiting to happen"" and would like to see ""instantaneous reactions"" from the authorities to incidents like this.

Calum Miller MP said the cost of removing the waste would be high

Miller asked the government for help to remove the illegal tip before it caused a fire or was washed into the river system. Addressing MPs on Thursday, he said: ""Criminals have dumped a mountain of illegal plastic waste... weighing hundreds of tonnes, in my constituency on a floodplain adjacent to the River Cherwell. ""River levels are rising and heat-maps show that the waste is also heating up, raising the risk of fire. ""The Environment Agency said it has limited resources for enforcement, that the estimated cost of removal is greater than the entire annual budget of the local district council."" Environment minister Mary Creagh said the government had inherited a failing waste industry that had caused an ""epidemic of illegal fly-tipping"". She told MPs the agency had served a restriction order to prevent further access to the site.

In a statement, the agency said it was investigating and appealed for information. It said: ""We share the public's anger about incidents like this, which is why we take action against those responsible for waste crime."" A recent House of Lords report found efforts to tackle serious waste crime have been ""critically under-prioritised"" despite the problem becoming bigger and more sophisticated. The Environment and Climate Change Committee recommended an independent ""root and branch"" inquiry into how ""endemic"" waste crime is tackled.

Reuters Lisa Nandy, pictured earlier this year, said the BBC should have leaders with a ""journalistic background""

Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has said she shares a ""real concern"" that political appointments to the BBC board damage trust in the corporation. The make-up of the board has come under fresh scrutiny this week following the resignation of director general Tim Davie, after a leaked memo raised editorial concerns including the way Panorama edited a speech by President Trump. Nandy told BBC Radio 4's Today the perception of political influence is ""a problem"", adding she would be examining the issue as part of the corporation's next charter review. The culture secretary also indicated that a string of recent scandals at the BBC suggested the corporation should have ""people at a very senior level with a journalistic background"".

Political appointments to the board would be examined in the charter review, she said in response to a question asking if member Sir Robbie Gibb, a former communications director under Conservative prime minister Theresa May, had overstepped his remit and weighed into politics. The Charter sets the funding and regulatory duties of the BBC and is negotiated with the government. Davie resigned from the corporation on Sunday, along with CEO of News Deborah Turness, after a memo raising concern about editorial decisions and perceived institutional bias was leaked to the Daily Telegraph. On Thursday, the BBC apologised to President Trump for a Panorama episode that spliced parts of his 6 January 2021 speech together, but rejected his demands for compensation. The corporation said the edit had given ""the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action"" and said it would not show the 2024 programme again. Lawyers for Trump have threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn (£759m) in damages unless the corporation issues a retraction, apologises and compensates him.

Watch: How the BBC works... in under two minutes

A week of damaging headlines has followed the publication of the memo, with some media commentators putting the spotlight on Sir Robbie. Nandy acknowledged that the ""sheer number of questions"" she had received about Sir Robbie in the House of Commons earlier this week suggested ""there is a real concern, which I share, that political appointments to the board of the BBC damaged confidence and trust in the BBC's impartiality"". ""That is something we will be looking at as part of the charter review."" Asked by presenter Nick Robinson about Sir Robbie's current role on the board, Nandy said he was appointed by the previous government, and would remain in post until 2028. The current charter states that board members would have to be ""unwilling, unfit or unable to discharge their duties"" in order to justify their removal, she said, adding: ""In these particular issues instances I'm unable to act."" Creative industries union Bectu has demanded the removal of Sir Robbie from the BBC board in a letter the the culture secretary and BBC chair Samir Shah. The union said Sir Robbie's position was ""a distraction and is untenable"". ""We simply do not see how staff can have faith in the BBC's leadership while a crucial position on the board is filled by someone perceived by many staff and external commentators as sympathetic to, or actively part of, a campaign to undermine the BBC and influence its political impartiality,"" the letter said. However, other commentators this week have drawn attention to the BBC's appointment of Labour figures over the years, which have not attracted as much criticism. Former BBC presenter Andrew Neil highlighted figures such as James Purnell, a former Labour MP who went on to a senior BBC role, Labour party donor Gavyn Davies who chaired the board of governors, Labour council leader Michael Lyons who chaired the BBC Trust, and former director general Greg Dyke, who was a Labour donor.

EPA Director general Tim Davie resigned on Sunday after a leaked memo raised several editorial concerns about the BBC

Davie's resignation came after a string of BBC scandals this year. As well as Panorama, the corporation has faced negative headlines about Strictly Come Dancing, MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace, two Gaza documentaries, and Bob Vylan's performance at Glastonbury. Some have suggested the priority for choosing the next director general should be a strong editorial background to help better grasp similar scandals in the future. Nandy said she would not tell the BBC what to do when it came to appointing the next director general, but she added there is an ""emerging thread through many of the challenges the BBC has had"". ""That thread is that the editorial standards and guidelines that the BBC has are in some cases not robust enough and in other cases not consistently applied which leaves individual journalists, presenters and editors in quite a difficult position on a number of occasions,"" she said. ""I think that does demand that there are people at a very senior level with a journalistic background who are able to uphold those standards.""",2025-11-14T15:05:25.766996

TikTok influencer HSTikkyTokky has been sentenced for crashing his Maclaren supercar and then spending nearly a year on the run from police. The 24-year-old, whose real name is Harrison Sullivan, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and driving without insurance. Sullivan had been wanted by Surrey Police in connection with the crash in Virginia Water in March last year. He failed to attend court in November and later posted social media videos from Qatar, Dubai, Thailand and Spain, but was arrested in October. At Staines Magistrates' Court, Sullivan was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, disqualified from driving for two years and ordered to undertake 300 hours of unpaid work.

He was also sentenced to a three-month curfew and ordered to be electronically monitored, complete an extended driving test after two years and undertake 30 days of rehabilitation. The judge described Sullivan's actions as a ""deliberate decision to ignore the rules of the road"". However, she added that she would not hand out a harsher sentence in order to set an example to his large social media following. In a letter to the court, Sullivan said he was ""ashamed"" of his actions. ""I understand that if I am acting in a dangerous way, this could influence others to do the same,"" he said. ""Spreading a positive message and helping people less fortunate than myself, that's what makes me the happiest.""

Lavish lifestyle

Sullivan was driving a purple McClaren at more than 71mph on the single-carriageway A30, which has a 40mph speed limit, when it crashed with another vehicle, the court heard. He has amassed more than a million followers across all social media platforms. His content often shows his lavish lifestyle, with him on nights out with young revellers. Witnesses to the crash said Sullivan was ""in a supercar going extremely fast"", with one stating that he was travelling ""at least 100mph or more"" before the collision. Sullivan was extradited from Spain to the UK after being arrested on unrelated matters, the court was told. A fresh hearing will take place in January next year to decide how much Sullivan must pay to Surrey Police and the Crown Prosecution Service for the additional costs involved in pursuing him abroad. The prosecution has applied for £18,049.47 to be paid to Surrey Police for a chartered flight to bring Sullivan back to the UK. Sullivan was set to appear in a Louis Theroux documentary for Netflix exploring the impact of online misogyny on young boys.

Marseille is renowned for worsening drugs wars, with rival gangs from high-immigration neighbourhoods in the north of the city battling over turf.

While Amine's murdered elder brother, Brahim, was known to have become involved with drugs gangs, investigators say that was not true of Mehdi, who had ambitions to become a policeman. They fear the murder was a warning aimed at Amine. ""That hypothesis is absolutely not being ruled out,"" said Marseille chief prosecutor Nicolas Bessone on French radio. ""And if it turns out to be the case, it will mean we have crossed another threshold. It brings back certain terrible periods in our country's history, when you went out and killed people simply because they were from a family with whom you had problems.""

A new photograph of King Charles marking his 77th birthday has been issued by Buckingham Palace. The picture, taken by Millie Pilkington, shows the King at his Sandringham estate in Norfolk, holding a shepherd's crook. It was published on social media with a balloon emoji and the message: ""77 today! Thank you for the kind words and well wishes on His Majesty's Birthday."" King Charles is spending his birthday in South Wales accompanied by Queen Camilla, where their engagements will include meeting Ruth Jones, star of the BBC's Gavin and Stacey.

There will be a reception at Cyfarthfa Castle in Merthyr Tydfil, which is celebrating its own 200th anniversary, with plans for a birthday cake for the King. The King is meeting TikToker Lewis Leigh at the castle, whose parents Neil and Kerry Anne from Merthyr Tydfil said they were feeling ""really proud"" of their son. ""We are so proud that he will be recognised for some of the hard work he's done with cancer awareness and school visits,"" said Neil.

Rebecca Middleton

When Rebecca Middleton became pregnant, she had no idea that she would end up in a wheelchair for the final three months before she gave birth. Rebecca had had a difficult first trimester dealing with nausea and sickness, and began to develop pelvic pain four months into her pregnancy. ""I could hardly walk, I'd always had some problems with lower back pain in my life. But nothing that significant and it escalated quite quickly,"" she says. After complaining about the pain, she was referred to an NHS physio, and eventually diagnosed with an extreme case of pelvic girdle pain (PGP), also known as symphysis pubic dysfunction. Problems with your pelvic joints are a common symptom of pregnancy, affecting one in five expectant mothers to some degree. ""I was terrified, would I ever walk again? How would I have my baby, how would I care for it?""

Rebecca Middleton Rebecca now helps raise awareness of the issue

After giving birth, Rebecca was in less pain, but she still struggled with basic things like walking, lifting her son or pushing a pram. ""I was disabled for seven months and had to have someone helping me all the time,"" she says. ""I just couldn't do the things that you should be able to do in looking after a baby, it was a really challenging time."" Prior to becoming pregnant, it was an issue Rebecca was unaware of and since her experience she volunteers for The Pelvic Partnership, a charity which helps raise awareness and support women with this condition. It says the condition is treatable with the right action.

Seek help

As soon as your symptoms start, the charity advises you get hands-on individualised treatment, including manual therapy, and ask for a referral for NHS physiotherapy from your GP or midwife. If you aren't offered this support initially, the charity suggests going back to your GP or midwife and asking for a second opinion. They can also refer you to maternal mental health support to help you manage the emotional impacts of living with PGP. Dr Nighat Arif, a women's health specialist, says higher awareness and early assessment could prevent patients like Rebecca needing wheelchairs or crutches. ""Without that early identification based on a really good understanding of the female body, we leave some of these women with negative effects for life,"" she says.

Victoria Roberton Victoria says her second pregnancy was much easier to manage

Victoria Roberton, co-ordinator at the Pelvic Partnership, is an example of how awareness can help. Like Rebecca, she didn't know what PGP was when she began experiencing the condition during her first pregnancy. She tried to stay as active as possible as advised and was referred to NHS physio sessions online and by phone, but found the pain worsening as her pregnancy progressed. ""They gave us exercises, stretches to do. By this point I couldn't do any of them. It was too painful,"" she says. It got to the point where even sitting became uncomfortable for Victoria, and she was largely homebound until her baby was born. The pain lessened after the birth of her daughter, but she began experiencing the same problem when she became pregnant with her second child. It's not an option for many mothers, but Victoria said given her medical history she decided to pay for a private physio as the NHS wait for referral was long. The physio gave her a full assessment and hands-on treatment including joint mobilisation, and taught her different ways to move her body to not aggravate her hip joints, which helped ease the pain. Victoria still struggles with a degree of PGP today, four years on, but her second pregnancy was much easier to manage because she understood her condition and how to handle it.",2025-11-14T15:05:32.395450

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has decided not to raise income tax rates when she announces her Budget on 26 November. Expectations that she would do so had grown in recent weeks. In a speech in early November she said she would make the ""necessary choices"" for the economy to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living. However, the chancellor could still decide to raise money by freezing the salary levels at which income tax rates are introduced. Other taxes could also be increased. Before the 2024 general election, Labour promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people. Reeves backs off from proposals to raise income tax rates

What tax, NI and benefit changes could be in the Budget?

What other measures could be in the Budget?

Welfare The government is under pressure from its own MPs to scrap the two-child limit for benefit uplifts. Currently, households on universal credit get extra support for the first two children, but no additional help for subsequent offspring. The chancellor has suggested that limits on larger families will be lifted, telling the BBC it was not right that children in bigger families were ""penalised"" in this way. Help with energy bills In October, Reeves told the BBC that she would take ""targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges"" while inflation remains high. The BBC understands the government could bring down gas and electricity bills by cutting the current 5% rate of VAT charged on energy, or reducing some regulatory costs which suppliers can pass on to customers. Youth employment guarantee Also in September, Reeves said that young people who have been out of work for 18 months will be given paid placements to help them secure full-time employment.

Why is the chancellor expected to put up taxes?

The chancellor needs more money in order to meet the self-imposed rules for government finances which she says are ""non-negotiable"". The two main rules are: Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliament

To get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament In an unusual ""pre-Budget"" speech on 4 November, the chancellor said her commitment to these rules was ""iron-clad"". She said she would do what was necessary to fix the economy, not what was popular, and again refused to rule out tax rises. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank had said previously that Reeves would ""almost certainly"" have to raise taxes to make up a shortfall in the government's finances. It argued this would let the government retain a £10bn buffer to meet the rules, but warned there was a ""strong case"" for increasing that safety margin. The BBC understands the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's official forecaster - has assessed the gap in public finances to be close to £20bn. This is lower than an earlier assessment of about £30bn which followed a downgrade to productivity, a measure of how efficiently businesses operate.

What happens during the Budget and what time is it?

The chancellor's Budget statement outlines government plans for raising or cutting taxes. It also includes big decisions about spending on public services such as health, schools and police. The statement is made to MPs in the House of Commons. It usually starts at about 12:30, after Prime Minister's Questions, and lasts for about an hour. The Leader of the Opposition, Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch, will give an immediate response.

""There were many times when I thought it was beyond me, so the sense of achievement is enormous."" Sophie's son Hector died from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), and memories of him inspired her during the ride. ""There can be no more spiritual place to do this journey than Patagonia,"" said the 62-year-old. ""The mountains, the glacial rivers, the vast expanse of unspoiled remote landscape are places that Hector would have loved and coming here has made him feel very close as we have travelled through this amazing, inspiring place.""

Getty Images Bad Bunny was the biggest nominee ahead of the ceremony, having made the shortlist in 12 separate categories.

Puerto Rican star Bad Bunny was the big winner at Thursday night's Latin Grammy Awards in Las Vegas, taking home five trophies. Among them was album of the year, for the acclaimed Debí Tirar Más Fotos, a project which embraced his island's musical heritage - and paved the way for him to perform at next year's Super Bowl half time show. Dedicating the award to ""all the youth of Latin America"" he added: ""There are many ways of being patriotic and defending our homelands. We chose music."" Charismatic Argentinian duo Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso also took home five prizes; with other winners including Alejandro Sanz, Gloria Estefan and Karol G - who is set to headline next year's Coachella festival.

The rapidly growing Latin music sector generated a record $1.4bn (£1.06bn) in 2024, making up 8.1% of total U.S. music revenue, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, which said it was shaping culture faster than any other genre. Bad Bunny, real name Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, has been at the forefront of that movement. For three consecutive years between 2020 and 2022, he was the most-streamed artist in the world. Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos) is the 31-year-old's sixth album, and fuses live instrumentation with the hip-swaying pulse of reggaetón and traditional Puerto Rican styles like plena.

Reuters Bad Bunny performed his hit song Weltita in a claustrophobic set that later transformed into an island setting, reflecting the tropical vibes of his latest album.

At the Latin Grammys, the title track earned him best urban song and best urban performance. He also picked up best reggaetón performance for Voy a llevarte pa PR, and best urban music album for Debí Tirar Más Fotos. He is also nominated for six awards at the mainstream Grammys, which take place in February, including the three major categories of album, song and record of the year. The star recently wrapped up a barnstorming concert residency in Puerto Rico; and is about to kick off his world tour in the Dominican Republic. However, he made headlines when he said the tour would not include any dates on the US mainland because he was concerned his fans might be targeted by immigration raids. His subsequent booking for next year's Super Bowl rankled some US conservatives. President Trump called the decision ""absolutely ridiculous"" and that he had ""never heard"" of the star - who has 74 million monthly listeners on Spotify.

Reuters Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso couldn't contain their excitement backstage

The Latin Grammy ceremony kicked off with a star-studded tribute to Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana, with Maluma, Edgar Barrera, Grupo Frontera and Christian Nodal playing a medley that began with his hit single Oye Como Va. Karol G and Marco Antonio Solís also took the stage for a sweet duet on Coleccionando Heridas; while Gloria Estefan played songs from her latest record Raíces, which went on to win best tropical album. But Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso were judged to have the stand-out moment of the evening, with a colourful, off-the-wall medley of their hits El Impostor, #Tetas, La Que Puede, Puede and El Día Del Amigo. Dressed in vivdly patterened Versace outfits, the duo played in front of four nearly naked, tattooed body builders, who carefully operated sewing machines at tiny, school-sized desks. At the end of the performance, the duo threw dozens of heart-shaped pillows into the audience, all containing the phrase ""te amo"", supposedly stitched by their hunky counterparts.

They duo dominated the alternative music categories - winning best alternative album and best alternative song. They also picked up best short-form and best long-form video, and pop song of the year for El Día Del Amigo. Speaking backstage, the childhood friends expressed their gratitude to each other. ""The most important thing here is that we've known each other since we were six years old,"" said Amoroso. ""All of this wasn't planned, it just happened. I want to tell Ca7riel that he's my friend, that I love him."" Ca7riel then surprised Paco with a long and seemingly passionate kiss.

Kobi Crolla is not yet 18 months old but he has spent almost all his life in hospital as medics treat him for severe brain damage. In that time he has suffered countless seizures and endured 17 operations, while his parents have had to give up their jobs to care for him full-time. Now his mother Kirsty Grandison, 35, is charting their experience on TikTok in a bid to help other parents of sick children in hospital. ""We used to feel like we were the only parents going through this,"" she said. ""There was no one online making videos where we could go for advice, so I started making videos to show life in hospital in a bid to help other people."" Her TikTok page has 34,000 followers and receives up to 40 private messages a day.

Chris Watt Photography Kobi has had 17 operations and has spent most of his life in hospital

Kobi was born 10 weeks prematurely at the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh on 17 July 2024. Despite weighing just 3lb 3oz, his parents initially thought he was doing well. However, that night doctors ""came pouring"" into his hospital room in Edinburgh as his tiny lung had collapsed and he had stopped breathing. Then Kirsty, 35, and her partner Daniel Crolla, 38, received the news ""that changed everything"" - Kobi had had a grade four brain bleed, the most severe kind. They were told he would not have any quality of life and they should prepare for the worst and call their family to say their goodbyes. Against all odds, Kobi pulled through and eight ""agonising"" days later, they finally got their first cuddle with their son, which felt like a ""miracle"". But his parents said his ""battles kept coming"" with Kobi developing meningitis and each day bringing a new fear with blood transfusions, lumbar punctures and scans.

Chris Watt Photography Kobi has been diagnosed with hydrocephalus that causes a dangerous build-up of fluid on the brain

""He was having up to 10 seizures a day. We were always panicked, always so scared for him. We still are,"" said Kirsty. Kobi was diagnosed with hydrocephalus that causes a dangerous build-up of fluid on the brain. The only option was brain surgery, to install a shunt to allow fluid to be drained from the brain - since then, Kobi has endured 16 surgeries. ""That's 16 times we've handed him over, not knowing if he'd come back,"" Kirsty said. Both Daniel, a bus driver, and Kirsty, a carer, have given up their jobs to care full-time for their son. And Kirsty is using her TikTok page - Kobi The Brave - to give followers a glimpse into the reality of life in a sick kids' unit. She shows where she buys specially-adapted vests to fit around his feeding tube, how to clean his feeding peg, showing them medicines and setting up Kobi's feeding pump and changing his bed. ""I get messages from other parents in neonatal saying my videos are getting them through and how it's making them not give up hope because they have seen how far Kobi has come from my videos and how well he does despite what he's been through,"" Kirsty said. ""I want to take all these followers on this journey as I know how many it can help.""

Chris Watt Photography Kobi was born on 17 July 2024 - 10 weeks before his due date of 28 September

Kirsty said caring for Kobi was the ""greatest privilege in the world"" but it was exhausting, relentless and a lonely journey. She plans to continue documenting Kobi's story in a bid to help other parents know there are other people going through a similar experience. ""We don't remember the last time we felt at ease, content,"" Kirsty said. ""We used to have little bits of ourselves outside all this - football, the gym. Now, we go days without having a shower. Sometimes, you wish someone would ask, 'But how are you?'"" Kirsty and her two children from a previous relationship live in Prestonpans, East Lothian, with Daniel, who has three children. They take it in turns to stay in the hospital with Kobi day and night. ""We've grieved the life we thought we'd have with Kobi,"" Kirsty said. ""It's hard not to feel jealous sometimes. You see people worrying about hand prints on the walls or toys all over the floor. We'd give anything for that kind of normal.""

'Flight or fight mode'

Now the family are hoping they can have their ""cheeky and determined"" Kobi at home with them for Christmas, away from the beeping machines and clinical smells of hospital. ""We will be on edge worrying and thinking what might go wrong,"" said Daniel ""His head can double in size instantaneously and we have to rush him back to hospital, you see all the veins in his head and it's like a balloon. ""It's very traumatic and we are constantly in a fight or flight mode. ""But when the fear feels overwhelming, his smile pulls us back. ""As a family, we can count on one hand the number of days we've had out together. ""That's all we want - more time, more chances to make memories."" The family are being helped with the hidden costs of hospital life by the Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity.

Victoria Gill/BBC News My own dog seems a long way from a wild wolf

If you, like me, have a spoiled, lazy dog that enjoys cheese flavoured treats, the fact that your pet's ancestors were wild predators can seem unfathomable. But a major new study suggests their physical transformation from wolf to sofa-hogging furball began in the Middle Stone Age, much earlier than we previously thought. ""When you see a Chihuahua - it's a wolf that's been living with humans for so long that it's been modified,"" says Dr Allowen Evin from the University of Montpellier, a lead researcher on this study. She and her colleagues discovered that the transformation of our pets championed by the Victorians through selective breeding actually started more than 10,000 years ago.

C Ameen The researchers studied more than 600 skulls that spanned 50,000 years of dog and wolf evolution

In a paper published in the journal Science, this international team of researchers focused their attention on prehistoric canine skulls. Over more than a decade, they collected, examined and scanned bones that spanned a period of 50,000 years of dog evolution. They created digital 3D models of each of the more than 600 skulls they examined - and compared specific features across ancient and modern dogs - and their wild relatives. This revealed that, nearly 11,000 years ago, just after the last ice age, dog skulls started to change shape. While there were still slender, wolf-like dogs, there were also many with shorter snouts and wider, stockier heads. Dr Carly Ameen from the University of Exeter, another lead researcher on this project, explained to BBC News that almost half of the diversity we see in modern dog breeds today was already present in dog populations by the middle of the Stone Age. ""It's really surprising,"" she said. ""And it starts to challenge the ideas about whether or not it was the Victorians - and their kennel clubs - that drove this.""

C Brassard (VetAgro Sup/Mecadev) The researchers produced digital scans of each of the skulls they studied. The pink skull on the left in this image is a modern dog with a shorter snout and the green image on the right is a scan of a wolf skull.

British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah was stopped from flying to the UK by Egyptian passport control earlier this week, his family says. Mr Abdel Fattah, 43, was Egypt's best known political prisoner until seven weeks ago, when he was released from jail after being granted a pardon by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. He attempted to fly to London on Tuesday with his sister Sanaa, but was told by officials at Cairo International Airport that he was not allowed to travel. ""They blocked him from boarding the flight and I had to go alone,"" Sanaa told the BBC's Today programme on Friday. There was no immediate comment from the Egyptian government.

""They didn't explain much. Our lawyers in Egypt are trying to understand the legal grounds,"" Sanaa said. She added that her brother had his British passport as well as a recently renewed Egyptian passport. ""I assumed after the renewal of the Egyptian passport that he would be allowed.""

Alaa Abdel Fattah's 13-year-old son, Khaled, lives with his mother in Brighton, where he attends a special needs school because he is on the autism spectrum. Khaled spent a month visiting his father in Cairo following his release from prison, but he has now returned to the UK. ""We're really glad to have [Alaa] back in our lives partially free, but he needs to have freedom of movement to live with his son, reunited with him properly,"" Ms Seif said. She added: ""Khaled needs his father. My nephew… is very, very comfortable in his school and his set-up in Brighton. We can't change. We can't keep creating instability."" Ms Seif said the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office had been communicating with her family over the issue, but she called on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's office to also give it their attention. The FCDO said in a statement: ""President Sisi's decision to pardon and release Alaa Abdel Fattah was extremely welcome news and a significant step forward.""

Sources close to Redbird insisted that they were confident that the bid would have passed a government review process, but cited negative articles toward the bid from the current Telegraph newsroom as a factor in shelving their interest.

RedBird itself has faced questions over the extent of investment it has received from China and Gulf based investors.

An IMI Group spokesperson said its ""priority has been to end the uncertainty and secure the Telegraph's long-term success"" and that it remained in contact with ""interested parties"" on a deal.

It said it remained committed to completing a sale, while co-operating with the government and regulators.

RedBird founder Gerry Cardinale had planned to expand the Telegraph's reach and subscriber base in the US, believing there to be a gap in the market.

Among other investments, RedBird Capital owns the Italian football team AC Milan.

The Daily Telegraph has been in limbo for over two years, when the Redbird IMI consortium paid off the debts of the Telegraph's previous owners, the Barclay family, hoping to take eventual ownership of the newspapers.",2025-11-14T15:05:45.803002

Ronald Surgenor/PA Wire A puffin in water at the Isle of Muck off the Antrim coast at Islandmagee

Puffins have been seen on the Isle of Muck in County Antrim for the first time in years, after a major scheme to remove invasive brown rats. It is the first time the vulnerable seabird has been recorded on the tiny island off Islandmagee since Ulster Wildlife took over the management of the seabird sanctuary 25 years ago. A programme of rat eradication began in 2017 and winter grazing has now been implemented to keep vegetation low, so predator cover is reduced. The charity's nature reserves manager Andy Crory said the discovery of the puffins ""proves seabird restoration works"".

Folklore becoming a reality

RONALD SURGENOR It is not known for certain that the puffins seen this year managed to successfully rear a chick

Five puffins were spotted in 2024. Then in spring this year, cameras set up as part of the rat eradication programme caught two puffins coming and going from a nesting burrow on the cliff ledges. Their behaviour, bringing food back to the nest, was a positive sign that they were breeding. For Mr Crory, tales of puffins once breeding on the Isle of Muck ""felt more like folklore"", but the myth is now becoming a reality. ""Seabirds face immense challenges globally, with 24 of the 25 breeding species at risk of local or global extinction,"" he said. ""So, while a handful of puffins on a tiny island may seem small, this moment is huge – it proves that seabird restoration works.""

Hope for pufflings next year

The puffin sightings are the latest in a long line of positive signs of the impact conservation management has been having on the island. Annual surveys have begun to record steady increases in eider ducks, guillemots, herring gulls and lesser-backed gulls on and around the island, year on year. It is not known for certain that the puffins seen this year managed to successfully rear a chick. But Mr Crory is staying positive. ""Our hope is that the Isle of Muck will become a thriving stronghold for puffins and, in time, tempt back other lost species like the Manx shearwater. ""For now, we're waiting with great excitement to see if the first 'pufflings' – baby puffins – appear on the cliffs next summer. ""That truly would be the icing on the cake.""

Puffins are a priority species in Northern Ireland and red-listed in the UK, putting them in the highest conservation concern bracket due to food shortages, climate change, and predation by invasive species. They spend most of their lives at sea, only returning to land to breed in spring and summer at the same nesting site with the same partner, year after year. Each pair raises a single chick during the breeding season. Ulster Wildlife said rats are a major issue for many seabird islands across the UK, posing a threat to eggs and chicks. The Isle of Muck is not accessible to the public and it is hoped that isolation will help the birds to return safely next summer.

A man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed actress Ariana Grande at a Wicked: For Good premiere in Singapore has been charged with being a public nuisance. A now viral video shows the Australian man, Johnson Wen, pushing past photographers and charging at Grande while the cast made its way down a yellow carpet surrounded by fans. Co-star Cynthia Erivo could be seen wrestling the stunned actress away from Mr Wen. The 26-year-old had posted on Instagram late on Thursday that he was ""free after being arrested"". However, on Friday afternoon, he was charged with being a public nuisance by a Singapore court. The incident caused massive outrage in the city state.

Local media reports say Mr Wen, who was unrepresented, intends to plead guilty. This is not the first time Mr Wen, who describes himself as a ""Troll Most Hated"", has invaded a concert or event. His Instagram feed includes clips of him disrupting other celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year. He did the same at a concert by The Chainsmokers last December. If found guilty, he may be fined up to S$2000 ($1540; £1170). Fans had earlier called for him to be arrested and deported. ""There needs to be action [taken] against him as this is clearly a criminal offence,"" wrote an Instagram user, in a comment a video Mr Wen posted of his act. ""Oh wow so you do this a lot... how aren't you in jail?"" one Instagram user wrote. Several accused Mr Wen of ""re-traumatising"" Grande, who has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at the end of her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds. ""Ariana has been through so many scary things... and at her Manchester concert and you thought it would be fun to jump the barricade?"" said another comment on Instagram. Some fans also criticised security officers at the Thursday event for not being vigilant enough; while others called for social media platforms to ban Mr Wen's videos. In clips circulating online, Grande appeared shocked when she was grabbed by the intruder. Her co-stars Michelle Yeoh and Erivo can be seen comforting her while Mr Wen was escorted away by security. Grande has not commented on the incident, and the rest of the event proceeded as planned. The BBC has reached out to Singapore's police and immigration authority for comment.

The cyber-attack left JLR unable to operate its production lines for more than a month.

Car sales to consumers were also affected initially, although JLR was later able to develop workarounds, and parts supply to service outlets was badly disrupted.

The cyber-attack, which took place at the end of August, forced JLR to shut down its computer networks, leaving it unable to operate its highly-automated production lines throughout September and into early October.

The carmaker posted a £485m loss – before tax and exceptional items - compared with a profit of £398m for the same period a year ago.

Jaguar Land Rover has reported a heavy loss for the three months to the end of September, a period during which it was badly affected by the impact of a serious cyber-attack.

The company says production has now returned to normal levels.

JLR also reported additional ""cyber related costs"" of £196m, on top of the headline loss. These are understood to include the expense of bringing in outside consultants and other support in response to the hacking attack.

According to the carmaker, its revenues for the quarter fell 24%, from £6.5bn last year to £4.9bn.

This was heavily affected by the production stoppage. However, US tariffs on cars exported from both the UK and Slovakia also had an impact, as did the phasing out of a number of Jaguar models ahead of the brands planned re-launch as an all-electric marque.

The crisis at JLR helped drive UK car production in September to its lowest level for the month since 1952, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.

Its impact was also felt well beyond JLR itself. According to the Office for National Statistics, the drop in production of some 27,000 vehicles knocked 0.17% off economic output in September.

The company sits at the top of a large and complex supply chain involving thousands of businesses worldwide, including hundreds in the UK, many of whom are heavily reliant on orders from the carmaker.

The stoppage meant a large number of them, including small and medium sized businesses, were also forced to shut some or all of their operations – prompting warnings of potential bankruptcies.

The government agreed to provide guarantees for JLR to obtain loans worth up to £1.5bn in order to help its supply chain. However, the company says it has yet to draw on this funding.

Separately, the carmaker itself set up a financing scheme funded by a separate loan, allowing suppliers to obtain early payment for new orders, in order to ease their cashflow.

JLR's chief executive Adrian Mardell described the cyber-attack and subsequent shutdown as an ""incredibly difficult period"" but said operations were continuing to ""recover at pace"".

He added the company was now ""back to doing what we do best – producing luxury British cars"".

The company's chief financial officer Richard Molyneux said operations were ""pretty much back running as normal"" with all plants up and running and at, or approaching, capacity.

He added it was ""interesting to hear"" the impact the cyber-attack had had on growth.

""It reinforces that JLR is a really important part of the UK economy"", he said.",2025-11-14T15:05:51.664896

AP Trump was pictured on Monday apparently with the Swiss gifts on his desk in the Oval Office

Swiss ministers have had ""very positive"" talks in Washington, US officials say, in a bid to cut US President Donald Trump's steep 39% tariffs on Swiss exports to the US – the highest in Europe. One senior US official said the Swiss were ""very aware"" of their trade deficit and were prepared to address it - hopefully leading to a ""meaningful reduction"" in tariffs. Swiss economics minister Guy Parmelin, meanwhile, said the two sides had ""clarified almost everything"" in the talks. Switzerland been trying to bring down the tariff rate - which has hit the country hard - for months.

Swiss industry chiefs came to the Oval Office on 4 November bearing gifts, including a Rolex gold watch and a specially engraved gold bar from Swiss-based gold refining company MKS. Initial attempts by Swiss President Karin Keller Sutter to change Trump's mind fell on deaf ears. However, a private business initiative last week may have made all the difference. Trump's response to the Swiss president's bid was that she ""was a nice woman, but she did not want to listen"". But after last week's private business initiative Trump said a deal was being worked on to bring the tariffs ""a little bit lower… I haven't set any number"".

For Swiss industry, that deal could not come soon enough. Tech exports to the US are down 14.2% on the third quarter of last year, according to latest statistics - a dramatic fall since the tariff hike was imposed in August. Some figures in Swiss business, particularly those trading in luxury goods, gold, or commodities, already had contacts in Trump's circle. In September, Trump appeared at the US Open tennis final in the Rolex VIP box hosted by the Swiss watch company's chief executive Jean Frédéric Dufour.

The president, apparently guessing what was going on, even asked if Dufour would have been there if Trump had not slapped such steep tariffs on Switzerland. Last week Dufour met Trump again, this time in the Oval Office, along with fellow business leaders including Johann Rupert from luxury goods maker Richemont and Marwan Shakarchi from MKS. It is quite normal nowadays for any leader heading to the Oval Office to come bearing a gift. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer brought an invitation from King Charles for a lavish state visit. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz offered a framed copy of Trump's German grandfather's birth certificate. Requests for confirmation of the gifts to the two Swiss companies involved brought a ""no comment"" from Rolex and MKS. But days after the meeting, Trump was pictured in the Oval Office with what looked very much like a Rolex ""Datejust"" desk clock, produced by the company as a collector's item, and worth tens of thousands of dollars.

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP The Rolex desk clock was pictured on Trump's desk on Monday

A White House official confirmed the two items had been given to Trump. The US president receives thousands of gifts every year and they then become US property, deposited with the National Archives and filed annually by the state department. They are eventually transferred to a presidential library. Some gifts can be kept but presidents have to pay federal taxes if they do not come from a close relative. In 1969, President Richard Nixon gently refused the gift of a Swiss Omega watch to commemorate the Moon landings. Whatever happens to the Swiss gifts, Trump's stance towards the Swiss appears to be softening, telling reporters he is working on something ""to help Switzerland"".",2025-11-14T15:05:53.567475

No-fault evictions will be outlawed in England from 1 May, the government confirmed, as it set out the timeline for sweeping renters' reforms. The changes also see the end of fixed-term tenancy contracts, as renters move onto so-called ""rolling"" agreements, as well as an end to ""bidding wars"" and clearer rules on having pets. Landlords have said the reforms would increase the screening of prospective tenants and have spoken of nervousness around what happens when tenancies go wrong. Housing Secretary Steve Reed said the government was ""calling time"" on ""rogue landlords"" by initiating a raft of measures in the Renters' Rights Act.

""We're now on a countdown of just months to that law coming in - so good landlords can get ready and bad landlords should clean up their act,"" he added.

Shadow housing secretary Sir James Cleverly said the reforms ""will drive landlords from the market, reduce supply and send prices up for tenants"". He said that, ""with a start date of May 2026, we are now set for a six-month fire sale with tenants forced out at short notice"". Approximately 4.4 million households in England rented from a private landlord between 2021 to 2023. The new rules will affect more than 11 million people. The Renters' Rights Act - described as the biggest shake-up to renting in England for more than 30 years - was formally approved at the end of October. While many renters welcomed the introduction of the timeline, some landlords expressed concern about the speed of the changes.

Deadline to implement changes is 'not enough'

Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said the deadline alone to implement the changes is ""not enough"". He added: ""We have argued consistently that landlords and property businesses need at least six months from the publication of regulations to ensure the sector is properly prepared for the biggest changes it has faced for over 40 years."" From May, properties will be rented on a ""periodic"" or rolling basis, rather than under a fixed 12 or 24-month contract. Tenants who want to leave can give two months' notice, which the government says will prevent tenants paying rent for substandard properties. Landlords will no longer be able to evict tenants for complaining about poor conditions.

More than 11,000 households in England had their homes repossessed by bailiffs following a section 21 eviction in the year to June. Victoria, 25, had to suspend studying for her degree after she received a section 21 eviction notice in March. She was living in Durham while studying at the University of Northumbria and believes the eviction was partly due to complaints about the property's condition. ""I ended up having no choice but to move back in with my parents and I was devastated.""

'Your safety net can be pulled away on a whim of the landlord'

Kerrie became homeless after reporting significant mould in her flat

Kerrie, 27, became homeless after reporting significant mould in her Cambridgeshire flat to environmental health in 2020. The council placed her in temporary accommodation while the landlord was told to address the issue, but she was still stuck paying rent. She said: ""I think it's outrageous that the landlord continued to charge me full rent... ultimately, he didn't really face any obstacles."" A few weeks after she moved back in, she was given a section 21 notice, making her homeless. She would nap in public bathrooms, sleep on long bus routes and shower at her gym. ""I think it's so ridiculous that your whole safety net and foundation can be pulled away on a whim of the landlord,"" Kerrie said.

The mould was reported to Kerrie's landlord

Ten households in Hackney, east London, in houses that are all owned by the same landlord, said they had recently been issued with section 21 notices without reason. One of the affected tenants, who did not want to give her name, said she was ""really panicking"". ""We were looking for a place this time last year and it took us three to four months to find one,"" she said. The government confirmed that all section 21 notices issued before May will stand, but it said landlords must begin court repossession proceedings by 31 July 2026. The overhaul of the current system means that, from 1 May, landlords will only be able to evict tenants in certain circumstances: if tenants damage a property, commit antisocial behaviour, or fall significantly behind paying the rent.

'Anti-landlord' legislation

Maureen Treadwell contacted BBC News with concerns about the new law. Her family rent out 10 properties in Hampshire. ""There are draconian fines if you get things wrong, so the whole thing feels anti-landlord,"" she said. She raised her fears that, without reforms to the court system making it quicker to evict bad tenants, there will be an exodus of people who want to let their homes. ""Is it worth letting your house and then having a court fight to recover it, or a one-year delay? It's not worth it. So it will end up making the housing crisis worse.""

Maureen Treadwell's family rent out 10 properties in Hampshire

Reed told the BBC he was ""working with the Ministry of Justice to look at how we can ensure that there are not undue delays"" in situations where a landlord wanted to evict a tenant who was misbehaving. In addition, landlords will be able to evict tenants if they want to sell or move into the property but not in the first 12 months after a tenancy begins. The new laws also include banning bidding wars and discrimination of parents and those on benefits, as well as setting out a clearer process for those renting with pets. Many renters' groups have welcomed the changes. The Renters Reform Coalition - which includes Shelter, Generation Rent and Citizens Advice - says section 21 is ""a huge issue"". ""It is not the prospect of giving renters these vital rights that is fuelling record homelessness, but the gross injustice of no-fault evictions,"" said Shelter's Mairi MacRae. The Renters' Rights Act applies to England. Scotland abolished no-fault evictions in 2017, but Wales and Northern Ireland still have no-fault evictions under something similar to section 21. In 2022, Wales increased the notice period for these to six months.",2025-11-14T15:05:55.721020

While the likes of France, Italy, Belgium and Netherlands were playing against each other in League A, England faced three teams from lower down the world rankings - Greece (ranked 48th in September 2024), Republic of Ireland (62nd) and Finland (64th).

England won five of those six games, with a surprise home loss to Greece the only dropped points.

Coupled with a World Cup qualifying campaign where England have won every match without conceding a goal, there is a concern they could arrive at next summer's tournament undercooked.

It is not like the Nations League could be truly used to experiment either, as Lee Carsley took interim charge of that campaign after Gareth Southgate's departure.

England had been planning to play two friendlies in the United States in June this year, but that was scuppered by being drawn into a World Cup group of five teams rather than four.

While England were left with two free dates for friendlies, other confederations were largely busy with their own World Cup qualifiers.

With Serbia, ranked 36th, the strongest team in England's qualifying group, it means Senegal (19th at the time) are the highest-ranked team the Three Lions have played since Euro 2024. And they lost that game at the City Ground 3-1.

The highest-ranked team England have beaten in that time is Wales (30th) - 3-0 in a friendly in October.",2025-11-14T15:06:07.160859

The 33-year-old New Zealander failed a drugs test before his fight with Fabio Wardley on 26 October.

He was tested by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (Vada) on 25 October.

Sources have confirmed to BBC Sport Parker tested positive for the recreational drug and not performance enhancing drugs.

His promoter, Queensberry Promotions said, external: ""Joseph Parker returned an adverse finding in relation to his bout with Fabio Wardley.

""While the matter is investigated further, no additional comment will be made.""

Parker could receive a two-year ban but could also be suspended for as little as three months depending on circumstances.

Any ban would be handed down by UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC).

Ukad, however, did not administer this test and will need to conduct its own investigation.

The BBC has contacted Vada and the BBBC for comment.

Boxer Liam Cameron was given a four-year ban in 2019 for testing positive for benzoylecgonine, a metabolic acid of cocaine, but rules have changed since then with rugby league player Adam Rusling getting a three-month ban in 2024 for testing positive for cocaine and MDMA.

In between the two sizable partnerships, England lost four wickets for 16 runs – both Root and Brook out in soft fashion.

Brook's innings was awful, showing disdain for this kind of exercise. In his first 15 deliveries, Brook twice danced down to the seamers and attempted a T20-style scoop. From his 16th, Brook again advanced at paceman Nathan Gilchrist and ended outside leg stump as the ball hit off. He was out for two.

Pope took his chance with a measured 100, securing his place in the team for the first Test against Australia on 21 November.

Stokes was similarly patient for his 77, gradually finding a rhythm to his batting after almost four months out with a shoulder injury.

Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.

However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”

Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.

The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”

Trump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.

The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.

The indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)

The Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.

The General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.

It said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.

“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.

West of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.

Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”

“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.

Syrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”

Some of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.

“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.

He also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.

“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.

He also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”

Social media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.

Denis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.

“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said.",2025-11-14T15:06:36.786841

The Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.

The balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.

Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.

A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”

The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.

As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.

The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.

CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.

The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.

A senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”

Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”

The surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.

Roughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.

China has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.

Still, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.

But this time it has more to lose,"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 07:49:53 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss,"Hong Kong CNN —

An anticipated meeting between Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California this week has sparked concerns of a repeat of the pressure campaign China launched last year when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.

At that time, Beijing encircled the island democracy with unprecedented military drills – firing multiple missiles into its surrounding waters and sending dozens of warplanes speeding across a sensitive median line dividing the Taiwan Strait.

It also cut off contact with the United States over a number of issues from military matters to combating climate change, in retaliation for what it viewed as a violation of its sovereignty.

This time, Beijing has already threatened to “resolutely fight back” if a Tsai-McCarthy meeting goes ahead.

It also slammed Washington for allowing Tsai to stopover in the US while en route to and from official visits in Central America, warning it could lead to “serious” confrontation between the two powers.

A defiant Tsai staked out her own ground, pledging as she took off on her 10-day trip not to let “external pressure” stop Taiwan from connecting with the world and like-minded democracies.

But the optics of the meeting, taking place in California and not Taiwan, and its timing – at a particularly thorny moment in China’s foreign relations and ahead of a presidential election in Taiwan that could reset the tone of its relationship with Beijing – may see Beijing tread more carefully this time, or at least not escalate further, analysts say.

“This puts the burden on China not to overreact, because any overreaction is only going to push China further away from the world,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.

That doesn’t mean, however, that Beijing won’t be closely watching Tsai’s movements as it calibrates its response – and decides how much military might to flex over her meeting with an American lawmaker on American soil.

The opacity of China’s system – and the potential for competing interests within its vast bureaucracy – also make it difficult to accurately predict its response.

“Every time Taiwan does anything that China doesn’t like, the Chinese react with their own military coercion,” Sun said. But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.

Rising pressure

The expected meeting, which McCarthy’s office announced earlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations.

Washington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communication amid flaring tensions over issues from a downed suspected Chinese surveillance balloon to semiconductor supply chains – raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.

Taiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.

But a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.

For Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.

That increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.

China’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.

The party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping – and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.

That’s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China’s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of “reunification.”

It is those pressures – and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing – that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.

Congress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years. Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.

While the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.

Under Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million.

Though McCarthy does not have Pelosi’s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.

Last month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future – something he had earlier said he wanted to do.

Beijing watching

A meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.

Pelosi’s trip – the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years – generated a fever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoric in mainland China.

This time, so far, domestic conversation in China’s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.

But the stakes remain high – including for Beijing itself – over how it responds, analysts say.

As Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.

It could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT member Ma Ying-jeou, the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.

Ma’s tour is a “once in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn’t want to tank that,” said Sung, the political scientist.

China is also acutely aware that its actions toward Taiwan are under a significantly brighter global spotlight following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi. Putin’s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan.

Beijing has recently sought to position itself as an agent of peace in that conflict – especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.

This week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China – an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.

An aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during a face-to-face meeting in Bali.

“(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.

“A reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.”",2025-11-14T15:06:46.162474

CNN —

Astronauts who will helm the first crewed moon mission in five decades were revealed on Monday, queuing up the quartet to begin training for the historic Artemis II lunar flyby that is set to take off in November 2024.

The astronauts are NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency.

Wiseman is a 47-year-old decorated naval aviator and test pilot who was first selected to be a NASA astronaut in 2009. A native of Baltimore, Maryland, he’s completed one prior spaceflight, a 165-day trip to the International Space Station that had launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in 2014. Most recently, Wiseman served as chief of the astronaut office before stepping down in November 2022, making him eligible for a flight assignment.

Wiseman will serve as commander of the Artemis II mission.

Hansen, 47, is a fighter pilot who was selected by the Canadian Space Agency for astronaut training in 2009. From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts.

He will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space.

Glover is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 after piloting the second crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.

“It’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,” Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We need to celebrate this moment in human history. … It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars.”

Glover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions.

Glover’s first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.

Koch, 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks — including the first all-female spacewalk in 2019. She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission.

About this mission

The Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, an uncrewed test mission that sent NASA’s Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected.

If all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined.

The “exact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission,” NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email.

After circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean.

Artemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972.

The Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, including spacesuits for walking on the moon and a lunar lander to ferry the astronauts to the moon’s surface, is still in development.

NASA is targeting a 2025 launch date for Artemis III, though the space agency’s inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to 2026 or later.

The space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade. The Artemis program was designed to pave the way to establishing a permanent lunar outpost, allowing astronauts to live and work deeper into space long term as NASA and its partners map a path to sending the first humans to Mars.

Picking the astronauts

Vanessa Wyche, the director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, declined to provide details to CNN about the selection process. But she emphasized the diversity of the Artemis II crew, which includes men and women rather than only a staff of White male test pilots as has been the case for historic missions of the past.

“I can tell you, they still all have the right stuff,” Wyche said. “We have requirements different than we did (when we) just had test pilots” on inaugural missions.

Koch said in an interview with CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the group found out they were selected a few weeks ago.

“We were all sent to a meeting that was on our calendars under a different pretext that didn’t sound as lofty as the one it was going to be,” Koch said. “And accidentally two of us were very late to that meeting.”

She said the offer rendered her “speechless.”

“It truly is an honor,” she added. “It’s an honor — not to get myself in the space — but because it’s amazing to be a part of this team that’s going back to the moon and on to Mars.”

French government minister Marlene Schiappa has come under fire from members of her own party after appearing on the front cover of Playboy magazine.

Schiappa, who has been a government minister since 2017, appeared on the cover of the magazine to accompany a 12-page interview she did on women’s and LGBT rights. Schiappa, who is the current Minister for the Social Economy and French Associations, was photographed for the cover wearing a white dress.

Schiappa has been a long-time advocate for women’s rights and was appointed as the country’s first ever Gender Equality Minister in 2017. In this role, she successfully spearheaded a new sexual harassment law which allows for on the spot fines to be issued to men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street.

Her appearance has drawn criticism from political colleagues including French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.

Borne pulled up Schiappa over the cover, telling her it “wasn’t appropriate, especially during this period,” CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Saturday, citing a source close to the prime minister.

France is currently in the throes of a political and social crisis triggered by French President Emmanuel Macron’s move to push ahead with controversial pension reforms despite widespread public opposition.

“We are in the middle of a social crisis, there is the issue of policing, there are people between life and death, and I have the impression of being behind a smoke screen,” Sandrine Rousseau, Green Party politician and fellow women’s rights activist, told BFMTV Friday.

French politician, Jean Luc Mélenchon who came third in the 2022 presidential elections criticized both Schiappa’s appearance and the decision by French President Emmanuel Macron to give an interview to children’s magazine, Pif Gadget, this week.

“In a country where the President expresses himself in Pif and his minister in Playboy, the problem would be the opposition. France is going off the rails,” Mélenchon tweeted Saturday.

Schiappa responded to her critics in a tweet on Saturday, saying: “Defending the right of women to have control of their bodies, that’s everywhere and all the time. In France, women are free. With all due respect to the detractors and hypocrites.”

French Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin came to Schiappa’s defense during an interview with French news channel CNews on Sunday calling her a “woman of character.”

“I wanted to say that Marlene Schiappa is a courageous female politician who has her character and who has her style which is not mine, but I respect,” he remarked.",2025-11-14T15:06:54.049161

The British pound crashed to a record low last fall as investors rebelled against budget plans by former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Now, it’s enjoying a comeback.

Sterling hit its highest level against the US dollar in 10 months on Tuesday, topping $1.25 for the first time since June 2022. The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is the best-performing currency among developed economies this year.

The UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3% after dropping 0.5% in December.

This resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector. Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns.

Inflation in the United Kingdom also jumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February, underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach.

The pound turnaround

The pound plunged close to $1.03 in September 2022 after the Truss government unveiled plans to boost borrowing while slashing taxes, unleashing panic in financial markets that fueled fears of a recession in the United Kingdom.

The International Monetary Fund predicted in January that the UK economy would contract by 0.6% this year, while all other advanced economies would grow, if only slightly.

“There was a lot of pessimism being priced into the pound,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING.

But the sharp pullback in energy prices and China’s reopening have provided some relief about the economic outlook since the start of the year.

“There was a big re-rating of growth expectations around Europe, and that impacted the UK,” Pesole said.

The euro has also been lifted by these dynamics, rising 2.3% against the US dollar in 2023. The pound’s rally has been sharper in large part because its 2022 declines were more severe, according to Pesole.

Both currencies have been aided by the greenback’s sharp drop from highs reached last September as recession fears have percolated in the United States.

A lack of clarity around the Federal Reserve’s next steps has also restrained the dollar in recent weeks. Investor speculation has increased that the Fed could pause or stop rate hikes due to concerns about the economy following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month.

Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, said he thinks the pound could rise to $1.30 this year and “potentially higher.” But he still sees risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of England’s plans and how rate rises will feed back through the country’s economy. And Pesole cautioned that currency fluctuations are often overdone when markets are choppy, as they are now.

“In a volatile market environment, moves are exacerbated,” he said.",2025-11-14T15:06:58.729923

Finland’s left-wing Prime Minister Sanna Marin conceded defeat on Sunday in the Nordic country’s parliamentary election as the opposition right-wing National Coalition Party (NCP) claimed victory in a tightly fought contest.

The pro-business NCP was expected to win 48 of the 200 seats in parliament, narrowly ahead of the nationalist Finns Party with 46 seats and Marin’s Social Democrats on 43 seats, justice ministry election data showed with all ballots counted.

“We got the biggest mandate,” NCP leader Petteri Orpo said in a speech to followers, vowing to “fix Finland” and its economy.

He will get the first chance at forming a coalition to obtain majority in parliament as Marin’s era as prime minister was expected to end.

“We have gained support, we have gained more seats (in parliament). That’s an excellent achievement, even if we did not finish first today,” the prime minister said in a speech to party members.

Marin, 37, the world’s youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019, is considered by fans around the globe as a millennial role model for progressive new leaders, but at home she has faced criticism for her partying and her government’s public spending.

While she remains very popular among many Finns, particularly young moderates, she antagonized some conservatives with lavish spending on pensions and education they see as not frugal enough.

The NCP has led in polls for almost two years although its lead had melted away in recent months. It has promised to curb spending and stop the rise of public debt, which has reached just over 70% of GDP since Marin took office in 2019.

Orpo accused Marin of eroding Finland’s economic resilience at a time when Europe’s energy crisis, driven by Russia’s war in Ukraine, has hit the country hard and the cost of living has increased.

Orpo has said he will negotiate with all groups to obtain a majority in parliament, while Marin has said her Social Democrats may govern with the NCP but will not go into government with the Finns Party.

Marin called the Finns Party “openly racist” during a debate in January – an accusation the nationalist group rejected.

The Finns Party’s main goal is to reduce what leader Riikka Purra has called “harmful” immigration from developing countries outside the European Union. It also calls for austerity policies to curb deficit spending, a stance it shares with the NCP.

Most notable of Marin’s foreign policy actions has been her push, along with President Sauli Niinisto, for the country to make a watershed policy U-turn by seeking NATO membership in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

That process is now almost complete, with Helsinki expected to join within days after all the Western defense alliance’s 30 members approved the accession.",2025-11-14T15:07:01.566573

It is one of China’s most popular shopping apps, selling clothing, groceries and just about everything else under the sun to more than 750 million users a month.

But according to cybersecurity researchers, it can also bypass users’ cell phone security to monitor activities on other apps, check notifications, read private messages and change settings.

And once installed, it’s tough to remove.

While many apps collect vast troves of user data, sometimes without explicit consent, experts say e-commerce giant Pinduoduo has taken violations of privacy and data security to the next level.

In a detailed investigation, CNN spoke to half a dozen cybersecurity teams from Asia, Europe and the United States — as well as multiple former and current Pinduoduo employees — after receiving a tipoff.

Multiple experts identified the presence of malware on the Pinduoduo app that exploited vulnerabilities in Android operating systems. Company insiders said the exploits were utilized to spy on users and competitors, allegedly to boost sales.

“We haven’t seen a mainstream app like this trying to escalate their privileges to gain access to things that they’re not supposed to gain access to,” said Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm.

“This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.”

Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software developed to steal data or interfere with computer systems and mobile devices.

Evidence of sophisticated malware in the Pinduoduo app comes amid intense scrutiny of Chinese-developed apps like TikTok over concerns about data security.

Some American lawmakers are pushing for a national ban on the popular short-video app, whose CEO Shou Chew was grilled by Congress for five hours last week about its relations with the Chinese government.

The revelations are also likely to draw more attention to Pinduoduo’s international sister app, Temu, which is topping US download charts and fast expanding in other Western markets. Both are owned by Nasdaq-listed PDD, a multinational company with roots in China.

While Temu has not been implicated, Pinduoduo’s alleged actions risk casting a shadow over its sister app’s global expansion.

There is no evidence that Pinduoduo has handed data to the Chinese government. But as Beijing enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, there are concerns from US lawmakers that any company operating in China could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities.

The findings follow Google’s suspension of Pinduoduo from its Play Store in March, citing malware identified in versions of the app.

An ensuing report from Bloomberg said a Russian cybersecurity firm had also identified potential malware in the app.

Pinduoduo has previously rejected “the speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious.”

CNN has contacted PDD multiple times over email and phone for comment, but has not received a response.

Rise to success

Pinduoduo, which boasts a user base that accounts for three quarters of China’s online population and a market value three times that of eBay (EBAY), wasn’t always an online shopping behemoth.

Founded in 2015 in Shanghai by Colin Huang, a former Google employee, the startup was fighting to establish itself in a market long dominated by e-commerce stalwarts Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).

It succeeded by offering steep discounts on friends-and-family group buying orders and focusing on lower-income rural areas.

Pinduoduo posted triple digit growth in monthly users until the end of 2018, the year it listed in New York. By the middle of 2020, though, the increase in monthly users had slowed to around 50% and would continue to decline, according to its earnings reports.

It was in 2020, according to a current Pinduoduo employee, that the company set up a team of about 100 engineers and product managers to dig for vulnerabilities in Android phones, develop ways to exploit them — and turn that into profit.

According to the source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, the company only targeted users in rural areas and smaller towns initially, while avoiding users in megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai.

“The goal was to reduce the risk of being exposed,” they said.

By collecting expansive data on user activities, the company was able to create a comprehensive portrait of users’ habits, interests and preferences, according to the source.

This allowed it to improve its machine learning model to offer more personalized push notifications and ads, attracting users to open the app and place orders, they said.

The team was disbanded in early March, the source added, after questions about their activities came to light.

PDD didn’t reply to CNN’s repeated requests for comment on the team.

What experts found

Approached by CNN, researchers from Tel Aviv-based cyber firm Check Point Research, Delaware-based app security startup Oversecured and Hyppönen’s WithSecure conducted independent analysis of the 6.49.0 version of the app, released on Chinese app stores in late February.

Google Play is not available in China, and Android users in the country download their apps from local stores. In March, when Google suspended Pinduoduo, it said it had found malware in off-Play versions of the app.

The researchers found code designed to achieve “privilege escalation”: a type of cyberattack that exploits a vulnerable operating system to gain a higher level of access to data than it’s supposed to have, according to experts.

“Our team has reverse engineered that code and we can confirm that it tries to escalate rights, tries to gain access to things normal apps wouldn’t be able to do on Android phones,” said Hyppönen.

The app was able to continue running in the background and prevent itself from being uninstalled, which allowed it to boost its monthly active user rates, Hyppönen said. It also had the ability to spy on competitors by tracking activity on other shopping apps and getting information from them, he added.

Check Point Research additionally identified ways in which the app was able to evade scrutiny.

The app deployed a method that allowed it to push updates without an app store review process meant to detect malicious applications, the researchers said.

They also identified in some plug-ins the intent to obscure potentially malicious components by hiding them under legitimate file names, such as Google’s.

“Such a technique is widely used by malware developers that inject malicious code into applications that have legitimate functionality,” they said.

Android targeted

In China, about three quarters of smartphone users are on the Android system. Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone has 25% market share, according to Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities.

Sergey Toshin, the founder of Oversecured, said Pinduoduo’s malware specifically targeted different Android-based operating systems, including those used by Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo.

CNN has reached out to these companies for comment.

Toshin described Pinduoduo as “the most dangerous malware” ever found among mainstream apps.

“I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive,” he said.

Most phone manufacturers globally customize the core Android software, the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), to add unique features and applications to their own devices.

Toshin found Pinduoduo to have exploited about 50 Android system vulnerabilities. Most of the exploits were tailor made for customized parts known as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code, which tends to be audited less often than AOSP and is therefore more prone to vulnerabilities, he said.

Pinduoduo also exploited a number of AOSP vulnerabilities, including one which was flagged by Toshin to Google in February 2022. Google fixed the bug this March, he said.

I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive. Sergey Toshin, Android security expert

According to Toshin, the exploits allowed Pinduoduo access to users’ locations, contacts, calendars, notifications and photo albums without their consent. They were also able to change system settings and access users’ social network accounts and chats, he said.

Of the six teams CNN spoke to for this story, three did not conduct full examinations. But their primary reviews showed that Pinduoduo asked for a large number of permissions beyond the normal functions of a shopping app.

They included “potentially invasive permissions” such as “set wallpaper” and “download without notification,” said René Mayrhofer, head of the Institute of Networks and Security at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria.

Disbanding the team

Suspicions about malware in Pinduoduo’s app were first raised in late February in a report by a Chinese cybersecurity firm called Dark Navy. Even though the analysis didn’t directly name the shopping giant, the report spread quickly among other researchers, who did name the company. Some of the analysts followed up with their own reports confirming the original findings.

Soon after, on March 5, Pinduoduo issued a new update of its app, version 6.50.0, which removed the exploits, according to two experts who CNN spoke to.

Two days after the update, Pinduoduo disbanded the team of engineers and product managers who had developed the exploits, according to the Pinduoduo source.

The next day, team members found themselves locked out of Pinduoduo’s bespoke workplace communication app, Knock, and lost access to files on the company’s internal network. Engineers also found their access to big data, data sheets and the log system revoked, the source said.

Most of the team were transferred to work at Temu. They were assigned to different departments at the subsidiary, with some working on marketing or developing push notifications, according to the source.

A core group of about 20 cybersecurity engineers who specialize in finding and exploiting vulnerabilities remain at Pinduoduo, they said.

Toshin of Oversecured, who looked into the update, said although the exploits were removed, the underlying code was still there and could be reactivated to carry out attacks.

Oversight failure

Pinduoduo has been able to grow its user base against a backdrop of the Chinese government’s regulatory clampdown on Big Tech that began in late 2020.

That year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a sweeping crackdown on apps that illegally collect and use personal data.

In 2021, Beijing passed its first comprehensive data privacy legislation.

The Personal Information Protection Law stipulates that no party should illegally collect, process or transmit personal information. They’re also banned from exploiting internet-related security vulnerabilities or engaging in actions that endanger cybersecurity.

Pinduoduo’s apparent malware would be a violation of those laws, tech policy experts say, and should have been detected by the regulator.

“This would be embarrassing for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, because this is their job,” said Kendra Schaefer, a tech policy expert at Trivium China, a consultancy. “They’re supposed to check Pinduoduo, and the fact that they didn’t find (anything) is embarrassing for the regulator.”

The ministry has regularly published lists to name and shame apps found to have undermined user privacy or other rights. It also publishes a separate list of apps that are removed from app stores for failing to comply with regulations.

Pinduoduo did not appear on any of the lists.

CNN has reached out to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Cyberspace Administration of China for comment.

On Chinese social media, some cybersecurity experts questioned why regulators haven’t taken any action.

“Probably none of our regulators can understand coding and programming, nor do they understand technology. You can’t even understand the malicious code when it’s shoved right in front of your face,” a cybersecurity expert with 1.8 million followers wrote last week in a viral post on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform.

The escalating climate crisis is shifting many people’s purchasing patterns and this extends to the $500 billion dollar global beauty industry which is grappling with a range of sustainability challenges across product manufacturing, packaging and disposal.

Strategy and consulting firm Simon Kucher’s Global Sustainability Study 2021 found 60% of consumers around the world rated sustainability as an important purchase criterion, and 35% were willing to pay more for sustainable products or services.

This shift in consumer preferences has propelled many beauty brands to set environmental goals: to move away from single-use and virgin plastics, provide recyclable, reusable and refillable packaging and offer more transparency around products’ ingredients so customers can ascertain how “green” their purchase is.

However, consumers still struggle to understand the sustainability credentials of many products, according to the British Beauty Council. This is because the industry’s clean-up efforts have been inconsistent, and fall short of making a recognizable impact in the absence of collective goal-setting, global strategy and standardized regulations.

Ingredient and branding transparency

There is no international standard for the beauty industry on how much product ingredient information to share with customers — or how to do so. Brands can set their own rules and goals, giving rise to confusion and “greenwashing,” where sustainability claims are often touted but not substantiated.

Companies often use marketing language like “clean beauty” to make it seem like their products are natural, for example, when they may not actually be organic, sustainable or ethically made.

“The term ‘clean beauty’ has become quite dangerous. It’s used to sell more products,” according to British Beauty Council CEO Millie Kendall, who added that such buzzwords are losing traction in the UK as British customers wise up to their shortcomings. “Customers need better marketing information and certification information.”

In a 2021 report calling on the industry to have “the courage to change” their business practices, the British Beauty Council wrote that, all too often, even natural ingredients involved in manufacturing products give way to “over-consumption, non-regenerative farming practices, pollution, waste and neglect.”

“The only way out of this is transparency,” Kendall told CNN.

Jen Lee, chief impact officer at US-based brand Beautycounter, said she continues to see confusion over ingredients among consumers. (In 2013, the company launched and published “The Never List,” which currently cites more than 2,800 chemicals — including heavy metals, parabens and formaldehyde — it claims to never use in its products.)

“Natural vs. synthetic ingredients has been a conversation. People think natural is safer, but it’s not always the case,” Lee explained. “Natural ingredients formulated in the industry can have toxic load. Heavy metals can occur in natural components of the earth.”

“We used to be more natural and organic,” added Sasha Plavsic, founder of makeup brand ILIA Beauty. “What was challenging is (that) raw materials were difficult to source or would come in inconsistently or products wouldn’t perform.”

Most makeup is created and molded at high temperatures, Plavsic explained. Purely organic materials often fall apart in this heat, leading to inconsistent results and subpar product performance. “Not every synthetic is bad,” Plavsic said. “Sometimes, it helps create the best in class formula.”

Unpacking plastics

The industry’s plastic packaging is a particular sustainability challenge — 95% is thrown away and the vast majority is not recycled, according to the British Beauty Council.

The cosmetics business is the fourth biggest plastic packaging user globally — after food and beverage, industrial packaging and pharmaceuticals — and plastic is about 67% of the industry’s packaging volume, according to Vantage Market Research. Beauty giant L’Oreal used 144,430 metric tons of plastic in its packaging material in 2021, for example, according to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (EMF). Estee Lauder Companies reported its brands produced 71,600 metric tons of plastic in product packaging that same year.

And only 9% of the global plastic waste is recycled, according to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States only recycles 4% of its plastic waste.

Many brands are trying to phase out harmful plastics from their operations and adopt post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. (L’Oreal has set a target of 50% PCR plastic usage by 2025, while Estee Lauder is targeting 25% “or more” PCR plastic — but both are far from achieving their targets.)

“Between 60-70 major global brands have made unprecedented progress” in PCR plastic usage across industries, EMF’s Plastic Initiative Lead Sander DeFruyt told CNN. But DeFruyt stressed that PCR plastic must be adopted in conjunction with brands removing single and virgin plastics from their usage cycles to truly make a difference.

However, PCR plastic is not easy to find — low recycling rates around the world mean there is limited supply. Meanwhile, demand for it is growing demand across industries, DeFruyt said. This competition hikes up its price, which is already higher than virgin plastic.

Hair care brand FEKKAI claims that it used up to 95% PCR content in its packaging, but pricing and supply issues posed a challenge, forcing it to currently aim for containers and packaging that feature at least 50% PCR in its packaging.

“PCR plastic is more expensive than stock plastic. The cost is hard and then sourcing it is too,” founder Frédéric Fekkai told CNN. “PCR is close to our heart, but there is a massive demand, so finding recycled plastic is difficult.”

The weight of retail

Beauty retailers plays a pivotal — and under-utilized — role, with control over stocking decisions and supply chains. But many vary when it comes to the standards they set for brands they sell.

“Smaller businesses do more, full stop,” said Jessi Baker, founder of the technology platform Provenance, which helps brands display their sustainability credentials for customers. “They move more nimbly. Some of them are born-good brands — climate friendliness was part of their setup. They don’t need to restructure their entire supply chain. Their culture already has it compared to the larger brands who need to work hard to change.”

Sephora launched its “Clean + Planet Positive” initiative in 2021, which labeled products that met its set criteria. (This is separate from the French retailer’s “Clean at Sephora” program, which is currently facing a consumer lawsuit alleging it carries a significant percentage of products understood by customers to be harmful.) Target launched a similar program in 2022, featuring a “Target Zero” icon for both online and in-store offerings that either have reusable, recyclable, compostable or reduced plastic packaging, or feature waterless or concentrated products.

Still, many steps taken by brands and retailers do not even begin to touch on the waste and pollution generated throughout supply chains, manufacturing and shipping, all huge problems for the industry to grapple with.

The missing player

The gaps in standardization in the beauty ecosystem can, to some extent, be filled by certifications such as the US-born B Corporation, or B Corp. This accreditation, one of the most well-known in the beauty space, is issued by the non-profit B Lab, which scores a company on a variety of criteria around ethics and sustainability. However beneficial it may be among eco-conscious consumers, though, it is currently completely voluntary for brands to apply for.

Governments and multinationals enforcing regulations and setting a base line for brands to operate from when making sustainability claims would go a long way to making change, many experts and business leaders believe.

Susanne Kaufmann, founder of her namesake beauty brand, says her efforts in Austria would reap better results if more countries around the world had stricter, more uniform garbage disposal laws.

“I package our product in a recyclable material,” Kaufmann said. (Her products’ packaging, which is refillable and reusable, is made from 75% recycled plastic — and is 100% recyclable.) If I send this to the US, the garbage is not separated… and it’s not recyclable,” she explained, referring to inconsistencies in recycling laws across the United States.

And when it comes to ingredients, the European Chemicals Agency lists 2,495 substances banned from use in cosmetic products marketed for sale or use in the bloc. But the US Food and Drug administration only lists 11, making it more challenging for American consumers to find safer, greener options. The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit watchdog, studied lab tests of 51 sunscreen products in 2021 and found that only 35% of products met the EU standard, compared with 94% that passed the US standard.

However, while government can set minimum requirements, Mia Davis, vice president of sustainability and impact at beauty retailer Credo Beauty, says the needle will move in the private sector.

“Regulation can raise the floor a bit. A person who doesn’t know about any (sustainability issues) should still be able to walk into a bodega and get clean products… But that’s never going to be what the market can do,” she said. “Market leadership is key.”

In the absence of bold regulations or global standards on sustainability practices, this “leadership” — undertaken both by brands and customers in the beauty marketplace — is likely to be the most immediately impactful vector for addressing the industry’s climate shortcomings. It will take continued collective advocacy and initiative to see meaningful climate-conscious change.",2025-11-14T15:07:06.952816

Scientists in Germany say they’ve been able to make a nasal vaccine that can shut down a Covid-19 infection in the nose and throat, where the virus gets its first foothold in the body.

In experiments in hamsters, two doses of the vaccine – which is made with a live but weakened form of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – blocked the virus from copying itself in the animals’ upper airways, achieving “sterilizing immunity” and preventing illness, a long-sought goal of the pandemic.

Although this vaccine has several more hurdles to clear before it gets to a doctor’s office or drug store, other nasal vaccines are in use or are nearing the finish line in clinical trials.

China and India both rolled out vaccines given through the nasal tissues last fall, though it’s not clear how well they may be working. Studies on the effectiveness of these vaccines have yet to be published, leaving much of the world to wonder whether this approach to protection really works in people.

Halting progress on next-generation Covid-19 vaccines

The US has reached something of a stalemate with Covid-19. Even with the darkest days of the pandemic behind us, hundreds of Americans are still dying daily as the infection continues to simmer in the background of our return to normal life.

As long as the virus continues to spread among people and animals, there’s always the potential for it mutate into a more contagious or more damaging version of itself. And while Covid infections have become manageable for most healthy people, they may still pose a danger to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised.

Researchers hope next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, which aim to shut down the virus before it ever gets a chance to make us sick and ultimately prevent the spread of infection, could make our newest resident respiratory infection less of a threat.

One way scientists are trying to do that is by boosting mucosal immunity, beefing up immune defenses in the tissues that line the upper airways, right where the virus would land and begin to infect our cells.

It’s a bit like stationing firefighters underneath the smoke alarm in your house, says study author Emanuel Wyler, a scientist at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin.

The immunity that’s created by shots works throughout the body, but it resides primarily in the blood. That means it may take longer to mount a response.

“If they are already on site, they can immediately eliminate the fire, but if they’re like 2 miles away, they first need to drive there, and by that time, one-third of the house is already in full flames,” Wyler said.

Mucosal vaccines are also better at priming a different kind of first responder than injections do. They do a better job of summoning IgA antibodies, which have four arms to grab onto invaders instead of the two arms that the y-shaped IgG antibodies have. Some scientists think IgA antibodies may be less picky about their targets than IgG antibodies, which makes them better equipped to deal with new variants.

The new nasal vaccine takes a new approach to a very old idea: weakening a virus so it’s no longer a threat and then giving it to people so their immune systems can learn to recognize and fight it off. The first vaccines using this approach date to the 1870s, against anthrax and rabies. Back then, scientists weakened the agents they were using with heat and chemicals.

The researchers manipulated the genetic material in the virus to make it harder for cells to translate. This technique, called codon pair deoptimization, hobbles the virus so it can be shown to the immune system without making the body sick.

“You could imagine reading a text … and every letter is a different font, or every letter is a different size, then the text is much harder to read. And this is basically what we do in codon pair deoptimization,” Wyler said.

Promising results in animal studies

In the hamster studies, which were published Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology, two doses of the live but weakened nasal vaccine created a much stronger immune response than either two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine or one that uses an adenovirus to ferry the vaccine instructions into cells.

The researchers think the live weakened vaccine probably worked better because it closely mimics the process of a natural infection.

The nasal vaccine also previews the entire coronavirus for the body, not just its spike proteins like current Covid-19 vaccines do, so the hamsters were able to make immune weapons against a wider range of targets.

As promising as all this sounds, vaccine experts say caution is warranted. This vaccine still has to pass more tests before it’s ready for use, but they say the results look encouraging.

“They did a very nice job. This is obviously a competent and thoughtful team that did this work, and impressive in the scope of what they did. Now it just needs to be repeated,” perhaps in primates and certainly in humans before it can be widely used, said Dr. Greg Poland, who designs vaccines at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new research.

The study began in 2021, before the Omicron variant was around, so the vaccine tested in these experiments was made with the original strain of the coronavirus. In the experiments, when they infected animals with Omicron, the live but weakened nasal vaccine still performed better than the others, but its ability to neutralize the virus was diminished. Researchers think it will need an update.

It also needs to be tested in humans, and Wyler says they’re working on that. The scientists have partnered with a Swiss company called RocketVax to start phase I clinical trials.

Other vaccines are further along, but the progress has been “slow and halting,” Poland said. Groups working on these vaccines are struggling to raise the steep costs of getting a new vaccine to market, and they’re doing it in a setting where people tend to think the vaccine race has been won and done.

In reality, Poland said, we’re far from that. All it would take is another Omicron-level shift in the evolution of the virus, and we could be back at square one, with no effective tools against the coronavirus.

“That’s foolish. We should be developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine that does induce mucosal immunity and that is long-lived,” he said.

More on the way

At least four nasal vaccines for Covid-19 have reached late-stage testing in people, according to the World Health Organization’s vaccine tracker.

The nasal vaccines in use in China and India rely on harmless adenoviruses to ferry their instructions into cells, although effectiveness data for these has not been published.

Two other nasal vaccines are finishing human studies.

One, a recombinant vaccine that can be produced cheaply in chicken eggs, the same way many flu vaccines are, is being put through its paces by researchers at Mount Sinai in New York City.

Another, like the German vaccine, uses a live but weakened version of the virus. It’s being developed by a company called Codagenix. Results of those studies, which were carried out in South America and Africa, may come later this year.

The German team says it’s eagerly watching for the Codagenix data.

“They will be very important in order to know where whether this kind of attempt is basically promising or not,” Wyler said.

They have reason to worry. Respiratory infections have proved to be tough targets for inhaled vaccines.

FluMist, a live but weakened form of the flu virus, works reasonably well in children but doesn’t help adults as much. The reason is thought to be that adults already have immune memory for the flu, and when the virus is injected into the nose, the vaccine mostly boosts what’s already there.

Still, some of the most potent vaccines such as the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella use live attenuated viruses, so it’s a promising approach.

Another consideration is that live vaccines can’t be taken by everyone. People with very compromised immunity are often cautioned against using live vaccines because even these very weakened viruses may be risky for them.

“Although it’s strongly attenuated, it’s still a real virus,” Wyler said, so it would have to be used carefully.",2025-11-14T15:07:09.111886

In a sea of Israeli flags, Yiftach Golov holds one that looks a little different.

Among the hundreds of thousands of protesters who took to the streets for the 13th week in a row on Saturday, Golov hoists a brown flag that represents a group called “Brother and Sisters in Arms.”

They are veterans – many, like Golov, from elite forces – who now feel they are fighting on a new battlefield: To save Israeli democracy.

“We believe this is our responsibility to go once again called to the flag of the nation to stop this madness to defend Israel,” Golov said, as he weaved his way through the protesters on Tel Aviv’s Kaplan street, between the high-rises that house many of Israel’s high tech companies.

During the second intifada, in the early 2000s, Golov served in a special forces reconnaissance unit. He was never before particularly political, focusing more on getting his PhD in biophysics from Tel Aviv University.

But when the protest movement against the Israeli government’s judicial overhaul plan began in January, Golov attended one a demonstration and soon became one of thousands of veterans, and now military reservists, who have taken up the cause as their new mission.

Some, including elite Air Force reservists, have taken it a step further, threatening not to heed the call to train or even serve in protest of the government’s plans planned judicial changes, which would give the governing parties more control over Israel’s judiciary.

Others have taken to becoming some of the most active organizers and demonstrators. Last week, a group from Brothers and Sisters in Arms protested by carrying a figure wrapped in the Israeli flag on a stretcher, the way they would carry a wounded comrade off the field.

While Golov says he has not taken the drastic step to refuse service, he understands the motivation.

“We’re fighting for justice and liberty, just like the American story, that’s the values that that are being represented symbolized back when we look at our flag, that’s something that was lacking lacking for the last few decades. So basically, we reclaim the flag,” he said.

Fellow members of the group, all wearing brown shirts with the organization’s logo, come up and say hello. They’re sprinkled all throughout the protests. One is even leading the “Pink Front,” a group of coordinated drummers who look like they are dressed for a rave, and often lead the chants at the protests.

They’re using skills they learned in the military – how to organize, how to mobilize – now for the protests. But more importantly, they say they have the same type of motivation.

“The very deep feeling that you are part of something bigger than yourself, that (you’re) allowed to sacrifice anything that is needed, whether it’s your career, health, seriously mental health,” Golov said. “We all have a mission, you’re willing to do it at any cost. You’re very determined, you know that you are on the right side, you’re carrying the torch of light. That keeps us being highly motivated despite the fact that we’re not sleeping for days.”

Israel’s protest movement is made up of many disparate groups, but the pressure from Israel’s much vaunted veterans has been seen as a key to moving the needle.

Last Monday, after weeks of sustained protests and the largest general strike in Israeli history, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a pause to the legislation, to allow time for negotiations with the opposition.

But despite the announcements, protesters are still out in the streets in large numbers. CNN affiliate Channel 12 in Israel estimated the size of Saturday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv at about 150,000 people. Organizers claimed it was 230,000.

Last week’s mass protests and widespread strike action came after Netanyahu said he had decided to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for advocating a delay in passing the legislation – a move that Netanyahu has since delayed, sources told CNN, due to “the present security situation.”

In his televised speech calling for a delay, Gallant had said the pause in the legislation was needed “for the security of Israel,” citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest of the government plans. He said pressing ahead with the proposals could threaten Israel’s security.

Under pressure at home and from allies abroad, Netanyahu said he would delay votes on the remaining legislation until after the Knesset’s Passover recess in April “to give time for a real chance for a real debate.”

“Out of the responsibility to the nation, I decided to delay … the vote, in order to give time for discussion,” he added.

But Netanyahu indicated that the delay was only temporary. He insisted that the overhaul was necessary, and reiterated criticism of refusal to train or serve in the military in protest at the planned changes. “Refusing is the end of our country,” he said.

Many protesters don’t believe that the pause is real, or say it’s simply a stalling tactic to give Netanyahu some breathing room and get the protesters to go home before he plows on with the reforms.

“We will start doing deactivation only when we will know 100% that Israel state will stay a functional democratic country. Whatever needs to be done for that,” Golov said.",2025-11-14T15:07:16.619650

Abu Dhabi, UAE CNN —

Turkey’s persecuted pro-Kurdish party has emerged as a kingmaker in the country’s upcoming election, playing a decisive role that may just tip the balance enough to unseat two-decade ruler Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

In a key setback to the Turkish president and leader of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party), the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) last month announced that it would not put forward its own presidential candidate, a move analysts say allows its supporters to vote for Erdogan’s main rival.

“We are facing a turning point that will shape the future of Turkey and (its) society,” said the HDP in a statement on March 23. “To fulfill our historical responsibility against the one-man rule, we will not field a presidential candidate in (the) May 14 elections.”

It is a twist of irony for the Turkish strongman, who spent the better half of the past decade cracking down on the party after it began chipping away at his voter base. Its former leader Selahattin Demirtas has been in prison for nearly seven years and the party faces possible closure by a court for suspected collusion with the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and affiliated groups. But its influence may nonetheless determine the course of Turkey’s politics.

The HDP’s decision not to field a candidate came just three days after head of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu, Erdogan’s main rival, visited the party’s co-chairs. He told reporters that the solution to Turkey’s problems, “including the Kurdish problem” lies in parliament,” according to Turkish media.

Kilicdaroglu, who represents the six-party Nation Alliance opposition bloc, is the strongest contender to run against Erdogan in years. And while the HDP hasn’t yet announced whether it will put its weight behind him, analysts say it is the kingmaker in the elections.

“It was a carefully crafted political discourse,” Hisyar Ozsoy, deputy co-chair of the HDP and a member of parliament from the predominantly Kurdish province of Diyarbakir, told CNN. “We are not going to have our own candidate, and we will leave it to the international community to interpret it the way they wish.”

Experts say the crackdown on the HDP is rooted in the threat it poses to Erdogan politically, as well as its position as one of the main parties representing Turkey’s Kurds, an ethnic minority from which a separatist militant movement has emerged.

The party and the Kurdish people have had a complicated relationship with Erdogan. The leader courted the Kurds in earlier years by granting them more rights and reversing restrictions on the use of their language. Relations with the HDP were also cordial once, as Erdogan worked with the party on a brief peace process with the PKK.

But ties between Erdogan and the HDP later turned sour, and the HDP fell under a sweeping crackdown aimed at the PKK and their affiliates.

Kurds are the biggest minority in Turkey, making up between 15% and 20% of the population, according to Minority Rights Group International.

It is unclear if the HDP will endorse Kilicdaroglu, but analysts say that the deliberate distance may be beneficial for the opposition candidate.

Precarious position

The accusations against the HDP place it in a precarious position during the elections. It currently faces a case in Turkey’s Constitutional Court over suspected ties to the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Knowing it may be banned at any moment, its candidates are running under the Green Left Party in parliament.

If the opposition is seen as allying with the HDP, Erdogan’s AK Party may use its influence in the media to discredit it as being pro-PKK, said Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul and author of Return to Point Zero, a book on the Turkish-Kurdish question in Turkey.

The HDP’s threat to Erdogan’s hold on power became apparent after the June 2015 election, the first general election it participated in. It won 13% of the seats, denying the ruling AK Party its majority for the first time since 2002. Erdogan, however, called a snap election five months later, which led to a drop in the HDP’s support to 10.7%, as well as the restoration of the AK Party’s overall majority.

“They are a kingmaker in these elections because the HDP gets about half of the votes of the Kurdish population in Turkey,” said Somer, adding that the other, more conservative Kurdish voters have traditionally voted for Erdogan’s AK Party. And last month, the Free Cause Party (HUDA-PAR), a tiny Kurdish-Islamist party announced support for Erdogan in the elections. The party has never won seats in parliament.

The HDP knows that its position is key to the outcome of next month’s vote, but that it’s also in a delicate situation.

“We want to play the game wisely, and we need to be very careful,” said Ozsoy, adding that the party wants to avoid a “contaminated political climate” where the elections are polarized “between a very ugly ultra-nationalist discourse against Kilicdaroglu and others.”

The party was founded in 2012 with a number of aims, said Ozsoy, one of which was “peaceful and democratic resolution of the Kurdish conflict.”

Somer said that the party was seen to be “an initiative” of the PKK, which later led to a heavy government crackdown on it in the name of counterterrorism.

Its former leader Demirtas remains an influential figure.

The Turkish government has been trying to link the HDP to the PKK but has so far failed to prove “a real connection,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC.

A post-Erdogan Turkey may give some breathing space to the Kurds and Kurdish-dominated parties in Turkey, Aydintasbas told CNN, noting that many Kurdish voters have recently left Erdogan’s camp. “For HDP, this is more than just an ideological choice,” she said. “It’s a matter of survival.”

Ozsoy says his party understands what’s at stake, not only for Turkey’s Kurds but for all its minorities.

“We are aware of our responsibility here. We are aware of our role. We know we are in a kingmaker position,” the HDP lawmaker said.

Two women arrested for not wearing hijab following ‘yogurt attack’

Two women were arrested in Iran for failing to wear the hijab in public, after a man threw a tub of yogurt at them at a store in the city of Shandiz on Thursday, according to Mizan News Agency, the state-run outlet for Iran’s judiciary.

Background: A video and report published by the Mizan News Agency showed footage of the man approaching one of the unveiled women and speaking to her before he grabs a tub of yogurt and throws it, hitting both women on the head. The video appears to show a male staff member removing the man from the store. The two women were arrested, as well as the man who threw the yogurt, according to local media.

Why it matters: Iranians have taken to the streets in protest for several months against Iran’s mandatory hijab law, as well as other political and social issues across the country. The Iranian government has continued to crack down on the protests, and on Saturday, Iran’s Ministry of Interior said that the “hijab is an unquestionable religious necessity.”

Oil prices surge after OPEC+ producers announce surprise cuts

Oil prices spiked Monday after OPEC+ producers unexpectedly announced that they would cut output. Brent crude, the global benchmark, jumped 5.31% to $84.13 a barrel, while WTI, the US benchmark, rose 5.48% to $79.83. Both were the sharpest price rises in almost a year. The collective output cut by the nine members of OPEC+ totals 1.66 million barrels per day.

Background: The reductions are on top of the 2 million barrels per day (bpd) cuts announced by OPEC+ in October and bring the total volume of cuts by OPEC+ to 3.66 million bpd, equal to 3.7% of global demand. In a note Sunday, Goldman Sachs analysts said the move was unexpected but “consistent with the new OPEC+ doctrine to act pre-emptively because they can, without significant losses in market share.”

Why it matters: The White House pushed back on the cuts by OPEC+. “We don’t think cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty – and we’ve made that clear,” a spokesperson for the National Security Council said. “We’re focused on prices for American consumers, not barrels.” In October, OPEC+’s decision to cut production had already rankled the White House. US President Joe Biden pledged at the time that Saudi Arabia would suffer “consequences.” But so far, his administration appears to have backed off on its vows to punish the kingdom.

Iran blames Israel for the killing of second IRGC officer, vows to respond

A second Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officer died following an attack in Syria on Friday, according to Iranian state media on Sunday. Iranian state media said the Iranian military adviser died after an Israeli attack near the Syrian capital Damascus left him wounded. The attack also killed another IRGC officer. In a tweet on Sunday, Iranian government spokesman Ali Bahadori Jahromi said the alleged Israeli attack wouldn’t go unanswered. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Sunday that Iran has the right to respond to “state terrorism.”

Background: The Friday airstrike hit a “site in the Damascus countryside,” Syrian state news agency SANA said. Israel declined CNN’s request for comment on reports of airstrikes near Damascus on Friday, saying its military doesn’t comment on reports in the foreign media. Iranian influence has grown in Syria since a civil war broke out in the country more than a decade ago, with the IRGC building a substantial presence as “advisers” to the Syrian armed forces.

Why it matters: The Israeli military declined to comment, but it has previously claimed responsibility for attacks it has described as Iranian-linked targets in Syria. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting Sunday: “We are exacting a high price from the regimes that support terrorism, beyond Israel’s borders. I suggest that our enemies not err. Israel’s internal debate will not detract one iota from our determination, strength and ability to act against our enemies on all fronts, wherever and whenever necessary.”

China and Brazil have reached an agreement to ditch USD and use their own currencies—China Daily pic.twitter.com/q33U4kVO5Q — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) March 30, 2023

An Iranian state news outlet is gloating at what it sees as the demise of the US dollar.

IRNA recreated a popular meme to mark China and Brazil’s decision to reportedly ditch the US dollar as an intermediary in trade, citing the Chinese state news outlet, China Daily. It shows two men representing China and Brazil posing in front of a grave labelled “USD.”

The meme was pinned to the top of IRNA’s Twitter page, and was met with laughter and ridicule. “Dream on,” said another user, pointing to the dollar’s use as the main reserve currency around the world.

China Daily said that the agreement was part of “the rising global use of the Chinese renminbi.” It would reportedly enable China and Brazil to conduct trade and financial transactions using local currencies instead of the dollar.

The move is aimed at “ensuring the security of key information infrastructure supply chains, preventing cybersecurity risks caused by hidden product problems, and maintaining national security,” it noted.

It came on the same day that Japan, a US ally, said it would restrict the export of advanced chip manufacturing equipment to countries including China, following similar moves by the United States and the Netherlands.

Washington and its allies have announced curbs on China’s semiconductor industry, which strike at the heart of Beijing’s bid to become a tech superpower.

Last month, the Netherlands also unveiled new restrictions on overseas sales of semiconductor technology, citing the need to protect national security. In October, the United States banned Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chipmaking equipment without a license.

Micron told CNN it was aware of the review.

“We are in communication with the CAC and are cooperating fully,” it said, adding that it stands by the security of its products. “Micron’s product shipments, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other functions are operating as normal.”

Risks expected

Shares in Micron sank 4.4% on Wall Street Friday following the news, the biggest drop in more than three months. On Monday, they closed another 1.2% lower. Micron derives more than 10% of its revenue from China.

In an earlier filing, the Idaho-based company had warned of such risks.

“The Chinese government may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies,” it said last week.

China has strongly criticized restrictions on tech exports, saying last month it “firmly opposes” such measures.

In efforts to boost growth and job creation, Beijing is seeking to woo foreign investments as it grapples with mounting economic challenges. The newly minted premier Li Qiang and several top economic officials have been rolling out the welcome wagon for global CEOs and promising they would “provide a good environment and services.”

But Beijing has also exerted growing pressure on foreign companies to bring them into line with its agenda.

Last month, authorities closed the Beijing office of Mintz Group, a US corporate intelligence firm, and detained five local staff.

Days earlier, they suspended Deloitte’s operations in Beijing for three months and imposed a fine of $31 million over alleged lapses in its work auditing a state-owned distressed debt manager.",2025-11-14T15:07:24.773950

China Renaissance, a top dealmaker in the country’s tech industry, said it would suspend trading of its shares and delay the release of its annual results because it still can’t get in touch with its founder.

Bao Fan, 52, started the boutique investment bank in 2005 and has been unreachable since the middle of February, according to the company. Shares in China Renaissance have plunged since Bao went missing, at one point dropping as much as 50%.

China Renaissance said in late February that it had learned Bao was “cooperating in an investigation” being carried out by certain authorities in the country. It gave no other details.

Chinese media have reported Bao might be assisting in an investigation related to a former executive at China Renaissance.

In a filing on Sunday, China Renaissance said auditors couldn’t complete their work or sign off on their report because of Bao’s absence. The board was also unable to give an estimate about when it would be able to approve its audited results for 2022 or dispatch its annual report by an April 30 deadline as required by Hong Kong’s listing rules.

Trading in the company’s shares was suspended from Monday as a result.

Bao is known as a veteran dealmaker who works closely with top technology companies in China. He helped broker the 2015 merger between two of the country’s leading food delivery services, Meituan and Dianping. Today, the combined company’s “super app” platform is ubiquitous in China.

His team has also invested in US-listed Chinese electric vehicle makers Nio (NIO) and Li Auto and helped Chinese internet giants Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD) complete their secondary listings in Hong Kong.

Over the weekend, China’s top anti-graft watchdog launched an investigation into Liu Liange, former party secretary and chairman of Bank of China, according to a statement by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission. The bank is state-owned and one of the country’s four biggest lenders.

Liu is suspected of “serious violations of discipline and law,” the statement said. He is among the most senior financial executives targeted in a broader financial crackdown by President Xi Jinping.

In January, Wang Bin, former party chief and chairman of China Life Insurance, was charged by national-level prosecutors with taking bribes and hiding overseas savings.

HSBC’s top brass defended their strategy Monday to frustrated shareholders in the lender’s largest market, as Europe’s biggest bank continued to face calls to be split up.

At an informal shareholder meeting in Hong Kong, Chairman Mark Tucker and CEO Noel Quinn took questions from investors on issues ranging from how the bank was approaching demands for an overhaul of its business to its purchase of Silicon Valley Bank’s UK arm.

In prepared remarks, Tucker and Quinn each reiterated the board’s recommendation that shareholders vote against a resolution on the docket for its annual general meeting in May that would force the bank to come up with a plan to spin off or reorganize its Asian business — the lender’s main source of profits.

Tucker said the board was unanimous in its opposition to the resolution, stating plainly: “It would not be in your interest to split the bank.”

He said the board had previously reviewed a range of options for restructuring the bank, and concluded that such alternatives would “materially destroy value for shareholders,” including dividends.

“Our strategy is working,” Tucker told the room of more than 1,000 shareholders. “Our current strategy is moving dividends up.”

Calls for a breakup

HSBC has been facing calls to separate its Asian business from the rest of the bank over the past year.

Shareholders in Hong Kong — where HSBC is a mainstay of many retail investors’ portfolios — contend that the London-based lender’s performance has been dragged down by its businesses in other regions.

Quinn addressed those complaints head-on Monday, saying “our profits in Hong Kong and the UK are no longer being dragged down by underperformance elsewhere. The group is performing well as a whole.”

Pressed later by a shareholder on the issue, Quinn said a breakup of the bank would result in “significant revenue loss” because much of its business relied on cross-border transactions.

Investors have also been unhappy with HSBC scrapping its dividend in 2020, at the request of British regulators. They argue that if the lender cordoned off its activities in Asia, it would no longer have to expose Hong Kong shareholders to requests in other jurisdictions.

Christine Fong, a district council member in Hong Kong, said she represented about 500 small shareholders who had been affected by the dividend cancellation.

“Street hawkers, taxi drivers or teachers — they all relied on the dividend to pay for their regular expenses, like mortgage, insurance payments, school fees,” Fong told CNN.

“That’s why, three years ago, what HSBC did upset those small minority shareholders.”

Fong has now joined calls for shareholders to vote in favor of the proposal for the bank to spin off its Asian business, despite the lender bringing back its dividend in 2021, albeit at a lower level.

Ken Lui, an activist shareholder in Hong Kong who put the resolution together, doubled down on his call for support ahead of the meeting Monday.

The resolution will require 75% of votes to be passed in May, but “nothing is impossible,” he told reporters outside the meeting venue.

Lui, who said he personally held a stake worth 100 million Hong Kong dollars ($12.7 million), laid out plans for his team to focus on “targeted outreach to institutional shareholders to present our case and gain their support.”

His group will also canvass 18 districts of Hong Kong “to tell HSBC shareholders that they finally have a chance to speak for themselves and protect their rights through voting,” he added.

The Ping An question

HSBC is also facing pressure from its largest shareholder.

Ping An (PNGAY), China’s biggest insurer, holds an 8% stake in HSBC and has backed calls for the bank to rethink its structure.

In a series of remarks made public by the Chinese firm last November, Huang Yong, chairman of Ping An’s asset management arm, said “we will support any initiatives including a spinoff that are conducive to improve HSBC’s performance and value.”

Since then, the insurance giant’s views haven’t changed, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The source told CNN that Ping An has been calling for HSBC to explore a reorganization, with an eye on boosting its valuation and simplifying its regulatory obligations around the globe.

The insurer has not recommended a specific path forward but will support any initiatives, including a spinoff of its Asian business, that could boost its stock performance or value, the person added. Ping An did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how it planned to vote at the upcoming general meeting.

Banking sector turmoil

HSBC’s leaders were also asked Monfday why the bank had scooped up the British unit of SVB following the stunning collapse of its parent in the United States. The purchase was made for £1 ($1.20) last month, just days after SVB had folded.

Critics have questioned HSBC’s ability to perform adequate due diligence on SVB UK’s customers because of how quickly the deal came together.

“Did HSBC look into the clients of SVB in detail? Say, the financial statement — whether they can pay back the loan?” said Fong.

Quinn and Tucker defended the acquisition, calling it a good business opportunity that allowed the bank to gain hundreds of innovative startups as customers. They pushed back on the notion that management hadn’t had time to carry out proper due diligence.

Tucker also weighed in on recent tumult in the banking industry, saying he did not expect an “immediate impact” on HSBC.

“After the collapse of a number of smaller regional banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse, the share prices of all banks have been suppressed,” he noted.

But he said he did not believe such developments represented “a systemic risk” to the sector. “I do expect a period of uncertainty” before nerves settle, he added.",2025-11-14T15:07:34.611039

New York CNN —

Americans have grown used to corporate executives treading the well-worn paths of the Northeast corridor to convene alongside elected officials in Washington, DC, and discuss geopolitics, policy and all that’s in-between.

In 2017, major CEOs from across the country came together to oppose North Carolina’s transgender bathroom law. In 2019, they called abortion bans “bad for business.”

After the deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, many of corporate America’s biggest names denounced the rioters and pledged to halt their political giving.

Recently, more than 1,000 companies promised to voluntarily curtail their operations in Russia in protest of Moscow’s war on Ukraine.

Dick’s Sporting Goods stopped selling semi-automatic, assault-style rifles at stores and Citigroup put new restrictions on gun sales by business customers after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018.

A year later, after mass shootings at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and a nightclub in Dayton, Ohio, Walmart ended handgun ammunition sales.

Corporate leadership has long been vocal on the issue of gun control – in 2019 and again this past summer nearly 150 major companies – including Lululemon, Lyft, Bain Capital, Bloomberg LP, Permanente Medical Group and Unilever – called gun violence a “public health crisis” and demanded that the US Senate pass legislation to address it.

That’s why corporate America’s silence in the wake of the latest mass shooting at a school in Nashville is so jarring. The United States has come to rely on the increasing power of large corporations as political advocates.

But Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a vocal advocate of corporate social responsibility who has a direct line to major CEOs around the globe, said that top executives are forlorn. Their previous efforts haven’t done much to push the needle on gun control legislation and without more backing, they don’t know what else they can do at the moment, he said.

Before the Bell spoke with Sonnenfeld, who runs Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, a nonprofit educational and research institute focused on CEO leadership and corporate governance.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

Before the Bell: CEOs have been quiet about gun reform since the latest mass school shooting in Nashville, have you heard anything about plans to speak out?

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld: Where is everybody else? Where is all of civil society? CEOs are just one group of people and it’s like we’re turning to them to be our saviors on every topic. They’ve joined causes with valor and nobility but they can’t just be taking cause after cause as if there’s nobody else in society. The social change that happened in the 1960s wasn’t being led primarily by CEOs. Social changes really happened when we saw the interfaith activity of clergy locking arms and canvassing legislators. We saw campuses alive and aroused. Where’s all the student activism?

The CEOs are still the most active even if they’re less active than they were six months ago. They’re not there as hired hands of shareholders to fill the role of politicians and civic leaders. They’re there to join that chorus, but they don’t want to be the only one singing.

So is this what you’re hearing from top CEOs? Have they gotten tired of advocating?

I just got off of a CEO call on voting rights and this morning we had a forum on sustainability – CEOs are still the most active on these fronts. It’s the same thing on immigration reform. If a CEO was working an 18 hour day on a 12 day week, they still couldn’t address all of the issues that need addressing.

The nation’s CEOs are waiting for everybody else to join them. They don’t need to restate something they’ve already stated. They’ve jumped in the pool, where’s everybody else?

So what do you think has led to this complacency amongst Americans and the growing reliance on CEOs to advocate on our behalf?

They’ve taken a very strong stance and they’ve gone out further than the general public. They are where the general public is on surveys, but they’re not where the general public is on action in the streets. So we’re ready for others to now do something. Enough already on saying ‘what are the CEOs doing?’ Social capital is as valuable as financial capital. CEOs understand that in their soul, they want there to be social capital. They want there to be public trust, but they need the rest of civil society to join them. And that’s their frustration.

It sounds like CEOs are frustrated?

Yeah, they’re frustrated.

But don’t these CEOs hold the purse strings in terms of donating to powerful politicians?

You would think that, but since the 2020 elections much less of campaign contributions have come from big business. Since the 2021 run on the Capitol, a lot of businesses either had an official moratorium or they’ve given mere pennies to politicians. The common impression on the street that CEOs are controlling campaign purses strings is 100% wrong.

Tesla sales again fall short of production

By CNN’s Chris Isidore

Tesla reported. a modest 4% rise in sales in the first quarter compared to the final three months of last year, despite a series of price cuts on its lower priced vehicles and talk by CEO Elon Musk about strong demand at those lower prices.

The first quarter also marked the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has produced more vehicles than it has delivered to customers. Some of that may be due to the ramp up in production at two new factories, one in Texas, the other in Germany, which opened last spring, and a lag between that increased production and sales.

Tesla said there was an increase in the number of its more expensive models, the Model S and Model X, in transit to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as to the Asia Pacific region.

But it does mean that over the last 12 months Tesla has produced 78,000 more cars than it has sold, suggesting that talk of strong demand by Tesla executives may not be backed up by the numbers.

“Early this year, we had a price adjustment. After that, we actually generated a huge demand, more than we can produce, really,” said Tom Zhu, Tesla’s executive in charge of global production and sales. “And as Elon said, as long as you offer a product with value at affordable price, you don’t have to worry about demand.”",2025-11-14T15:07:40.506344

CNN —

Why do we bury our departed loved ones in a cemetery? A primary purpose is to provide survivors with an opportunity to grieve and gain a sense of closure. The cemetery is a place for the living as much as it is a place for the dead.

But what about when the dearly departed are not human – but our pets?

Eric Tourigny Eric Tourigny

The Spanish city of Barcelona recently announced that it will be investing in the establishment of the country’s first public pet cemetery. Set to open next year, it will offer both burials and cremations – with an estimated 7,000 carried out each year.

For me, as someone who has spent years researching the development of pet cemeteries elsewhere in the world, this news came as a shock. Barcelona is a densely populated city with limited privately owned land – one where 50% of families own a pet.

How did a city that is home to 180,000 dogs not already have a public pet cemetery? Until now, the service was only provided by the private sector, according to Barcelona’s Councilor for Climate Emergency and Ecological Transition, Eloi Badia. He added that the municipal-funded initiative was sparked by “constant public demand.”

After all, public pet cemeteries have been around in Europe and the Americas since the late 19th century. Britain’s first public pet cemetery appeared in London’s Hyde Park in 1881. New York’s Hartsdale pet cemetery was founded in 1896, followed a few years later by Paris’ ornate Cimetière des Chiens in 1899.

A grave discovery

I became interested in the history of modern pet burial practices while investigating the archaeological record of a centuries-old house in Toronto. I came across a (very) large dog buried in the back garden which, according to the historical record, was occupied between 1840 and 1870.

This dog survived to an elderly age but, sadly, suffered from degenerative joint disease and severe infections during his last months. His ailments progressed to such a state that suggest he received some level of care in his final weeks. He then was buried in a personal plot behind the family home.

This elderly dog led me to think about the different ways people interact with the bodies of their pets after death. Could this behavior be reflective of the relationships they held with their animals in life? In this instance, why take the time to carefully bury a dog in its own space when other, arguably easier options existed?

""Darling Sammie,"" reads one of the animal gravestones dating back to the 1890s in Hyde Park Pet Cemetery, London. Photo taken by Eric Tourigny with permission from The Royal Parks. Eric Tourigny

This, after all, was an era when people often disposed of their dead pets in the river, or might have sold their bodies for meat and skin.

Good hygiene is an obvious reason to choose a burial – no one wants decomposing animal bodies in the street or their garden – but that wouldn’t immediately warrant a personalized, dedicated burial and gravestone.

The most straight forward option would be to dispose of a deceased animal with the household waste. But such treatment would evidently feel less ceremonious and would not offer appropriate emotional closure to what was likely an important relationship.

A member of the family

Like the burial of people, the burial of pets is an intimate cultural practice, one that changes over time and is reflective of the changing relationships that a society has with its cherished creatures.

My study of historic gravestones and epitaphs in Britain from the Victorian period to today shows this changing human-animal relationship. In the 19th century, gravestones were often dedicated to a “loving friend” or “devoted companion,” suggesting pets were mostly considered important friends.

By the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family – evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by “Mummy and Daddy.”

By the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family – evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by “Mummy and Daddy.” Eric Tourigny

Society’s changing attitude towards the role of animals in the afterlife can also be found. Fast-forward a few decades later, and gravestones were more likely to reference a reunion then earlier ones. For example, the owners of Denny, the “brave little cat” buried in an east London cemetery in 1952, wrote on his epitaph “God bless until we meet again.”

I wonder what the epitaphs in Barcelona’s new cemetery will reveal about modern Catalan relationships with animals.

Over time, our ways of treating our animal dead appear to reflect an even closer relationship in life. Once strictly forbidden by law, the last decade saw many jurisdictions, like the state of New York, allowing the co-burial of cremated animals and people, which will undoubtedly lead to changing funerary and commemoration practices for both humans and animals.

Modern mourning

For me, the most remarkable similarity between modern and historic pet cemeteries is the striking evidence for the heartbreak and taboos around grieving for animals.

The connection that someone has with their pet can be just as strong and just as significant as their relationships with other humans. Yet today, as in over 100 years ago, individuals continue to struggle to find the appropriate outlet to express their pain, hiding heartache for fear of the social repercussions that might come with public acknowledgment of the existence of such a bond.

The RSPCA reassures the public on its website that they should not feel shame for their grief. In the UK, charities like the Blue Cross and Rainbow Bridge Pet Loss Grief Center offer counseling to bereaved humans.

Close relationships between people and animals have existed for millennia, but in western European cultures, there were few acceptable ways to mourn that relationship. As society becomes more accepting of the importance of human-animal relationships to our collective wellbeing, it is not surprising to see us follow rituals resembling those we use to mourn the loss of our closest human relationships.

At an estimated cost of €200 ($217) per service at the new Barcelona cemetery, it is important to acknowledge that this opportunity to grieve will not be financially available to everyone in the city.

This will not be a space for all of the city’s pets. Pet owners may opt to keep cremated remains within their home or spread out ashes in a meaningful location instead. Online forums and digital pet cemeteries also provide other opportunities to commemorate the relationship and express grief.

CNN —

Cruising at a depth of 8,336 meters (over 27,000 feet) just above the seabed, a young snailfish has become the deepest fish ever filmed by scientists during a probe into the abyss of the northern Pacific Ocean.

Scientists from University of Western Australia and Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology released footage of the snailfish on Sunday filmed last September by sea robots in deep trenches off Japan.

Along with the filming the deepest snailfish, the scientists physically caught two other specimens at 8,022 meters and set another record for the deepest catch.

Previously, the deepest snailfish ever spotted was at 7,703 meters in 2008, while scientists had never been able to collect fish from anywhere below 8,000 meters.

“What is significant is that it shows how far a particular type of fish will descend in the ocean,” said marine biologist Alan Jamieson, founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre, who led the expedition.

These two fish were caught at a depth of just over 8,000 meters in the Japan Trench in the northern Pacific Ocean. Caladan Oceanic

Scientists are filming in the trenches off Japan as part of a 10-year study into the deepest fish populations in the world. Snailfish are members of Liparidae family, and while most snailfish live in shallow water, others survive at some of the greatest depths ever recorded, Jamieson said.

During the two-month survey last year, three “landers” – automatic sea robots fitted with high-resolution cameras – were dropped into three trenches – the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches – at varying depths.

In the Izu-Ogasawara trench, footage showed the deepest snailfish hovering calmly alongside other crustaceans on the seabed.

Jamieson classified the fish as a juvenile and said younger deep sea snailfish often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators that swim at shallower depths.

Another clip shot at between 7,500 and 8,200 meters in the same trench showed a colony of fish and crustaceans munching at bait tied to an undersea robot.

Images of the two captured snailfish – identified as Pseudoliparis belyaevi – provide a rare glimpse of the unique features that help the deep sea species survive the extreme environment.

They have tiny eyes, a translucent body, and their lack of swim bladder, which helps other fish float, works to their advantage, Jamieson said.

The professor said the Pacific Ocean is particularly conducive to vibrant activity due to its warm southern current, which encourages sea creatures to go deeper, while its abundant marine life provides a good source of food for bottom feeders.

Scientists would like to know more about creatures living at extreme depths, but cost is the constraint, Jamieson said, adding that each lander alone costs them $200,000 to assemble and operate.

“The challenges are that technology has been expensive and scientists don’t have a lot of money,” he said.",2025-11-14T15:07:47.618597

OPEC and its allies’ surprise move to slash oil production will soon be felt at US gas pumps.

The group known as OPEC+ announced Sunday it would cut oil production by more than 1.6 million barrels a day starting in May, running through the end of the year. The news sent both Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, and WTI, the US benchmark, up about 6% in trading Monday.

The production cut announcement also had an immediate impact on gasoline futures, which will be passed onto US drivers much more quickly than the spike in oil prices. RBOB, the most closely watched wholesale gasoline price, was up about 8 cents a gallon, or about 3%, in morning trading.

“I think OPEC is reawakening the inflation monster,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. “The White House has to be shocked and major-time pissed. It certainly alters the calculus for a while.”

The national average for US gas prices stood at $3.51, on Monday, according to AAA. Kloza said he could see it getting up to $3.80 to $3.90 in relatively short order thanks to the move by OPEC.

“We’re not going to get back to $5 a gallon. I don’t think we’re even going as high as $4,” he said. But he said by the end of the summer US drivers could be back above year-earlier prices, especially if there is a hurricane or other storms affecting production along the Gulf Coast.

The average US regular gas price a year ago stood at $4.19 a gallon in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption that caused to world’s energy markets. Prices eventually reached a record $5.02 a gallon on June 14, before starting a slow but steady decline over the course of more than three months during which the average price fell every day. The decline was partly driven by the release of oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and partly by concerns that there could be a US or global recession that reduced the demand for gasoline.

Even at $3.51, US gas prices were just below the $3.53 average on Feb. 23, 2022, the day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Kloza said one thing keeping prices from getting anywhere near the record levels of 2022 is that the US plans additional releases from the SPR, and US oil production and refining capacity are both up. But a cut of 1 million barrels a day of oil by OPEC+ will not be easy to make up.

CNN —

Last year, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia spoke at a white nationalist event organized by Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes that caused Republican leaders to denounce her.

Last week, Greene’s Twitter account was temporarily suspended by the Elon Musk-headed platform over a tweet with a graphic referring to a “Trans Day of Vengeance,” as she denounced a planned transgender rights rally.

And come Tuesday, Greene has announced plans to protest in New York City when former President Donald Trump is expected to be arraigned on an indictment of more than 30 counts, calling the proceedings against him an “unconstitutional WITCH HUNT!”

But on Sunday, Greene was featured on CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview the long-running show promoted on Twitter with the tease: “Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, nicknamed MTG, isn’t afraid to share her opinions, no matter how intense and in-your-face they are. She sits down with Lesley Stahl this Sunday on 60 Minutes.” The images attached to this tweet by “60 Minutes” include Greene and Stahl walking through the US Capitol, taking a stroll outside and Greene showing Stahl something on her phone.

In the segment that aired Sunday night, Stahl noted the congresswoman had moved from the fringe to the GOP’s front row in two years despite a “sharp tongue” and “some pretty radical views” as well as “over the top” comments such as “the Democrats are a party of pedophiles.” Stahl also referred to video of Greene chasing a Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivor, still maintaining that the 2020 election was stolen and failing to criticize Trump over spending. (The interview was conducted before news of his indictment.)

But Stahl didn’t mention Greene spoke at a white nationalist event a year ago while a member of Congress or her extreme anti-Muslim views and her defense of January 6 rioters.

Criticism of CBS for amplifying Greene has been swift and well-deserved even before the program aired. Former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted beforehand: “Wow. Insane that 60 min would do this.” (Kinzinger is a CNN senior political commentator.)

Journalist Molly Jong-Fast also slammed “60 Minutes” with the tweet: “Attention is currency and 60 minutes is spending its currency on the Jewish space lasers woman.” (Jong-Fast was apparently referring to Greene’s past claim that a massive California wildfire was started by “a laser” beamed from space controlled by a prominent Jewish banking family.)

David Hogg, who survived the 2018 horrific school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and has since become an activist against gun violence, responded, “I look forward to your questions about why she thinks school shootings are fake and why she’s supported QAnon.”

Greene amplified the conspiracy theory — two years before being elected to Congress — that the Parkland shooting that took 17 lives was staged. And in 2019, Greene appeared on video confronting Hogg outside the Capitol when he was championing laws to save lives from gun violence, screaming that the then-teenager was a “coward.” She also called Hogg “#littleHitler” on social media.

Greene’s own tweet promoting Sunday’s segment was not filled with her typical smears of “fake news” when she doesn’t like the coverage. Rather, Greene urged people to tune in as she praised “60 Minutes” host Stahl (and misspelled her first name): “It was an honor to spend a few days with the legendary icon Leslie Stahl and talented crew @60Minutes.” Greene added, “Leslie is a trailblazer for women in journalism. And while we may disagree on some issues, I respect her greatly.”

Now, it is true that “60 Minutes” over its 50-plus-year history has featured what the show has dubbed “controversial” guests. These include a 2000 interview with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose 1995 terrorist attack left 168 dead, including 19 children. And the show did a 1979 interview with Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

Perhaps “60 Minutes” views Greene — who has repeatedly downplayed and even defended the January 6, 2021, attack plus called for the GOP to become the party of “Christian nationalism” — in the vein of its long list of controversial guests. (CBS had not responded to a request from CNN for comment at time of publishing.)

However, the choice of Greene as a guest instantly recalls the comments of then-CBS CEO Les Moonves during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign when he admitted that Trump’s candidacy “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” Moonves added, “The money’s rolling in and this is fun. … (T)his is going to be a very good year for us,” concluding, “Sorry. It’s a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald. Keep going.”

Moonves may be gone from CBS, but it appears his mindset continues at “60 Minutes.” And that may be good for “60 Minutes,” but it’s definitely not good for America.",2025-11-14T15:07:55.849211

Originally a term used by trophy hunters in Africa, the “Big Five” described the animals most challenging to shoot and kill: the lion, elephant, leopard, rhino, and buffalo. Nowadays, it is more loosely used to refer to some of Africa’s largest and most iconic animals.

However, British photographer Graeme Green has reclaimed the narrative, creating a global “New Big Five” for wildlife photography. In 2021, 50,000 people around the world voted for the five animals they would most like to photograph, or see photographed, in the wild. Five animals were crowned the winners: the elephant, polar bear, lion, gorilla and tiger.

This week, sees the publication of “The New Big 5” photography book, which features images of those animals and other at-risk wildlife, from photography legends such as Ami Vitale, Steve McCurry and Paul Nicklen, and essays from famous conservationists and activists including like Jane Goodall and Paula Kahumbu.

Green says that the book celebrates wildlife and is a global call to action on issues impacting wildlife, including habitat loss, poaching, pollution and climate change.

Animals at risk

Green was on assignment in Botswana at least a decade ago when he came up with the idea for a project to encourage people to “shoot with a camera, not a gun,” he says.

“I thought this would be a way to get people really focusing on wildlife, thinking about the wildlife they love, thinking about the animals that are at risk.”

In total, the book includes the work of 144 globally renowned wildlife photographers from Ecuador to India. Curating the images took nearly two years of work, says Green.

“I think these are some of the most beautiful and creative images that I’ve seen put together in one book,” says Green. “These are the species that we are at risk of losing.”

According to the UN, nature is declining at an unprecedented rate, with around one million of the planet’s animal and plant species facing extinction. The “New Big 5,” all of which are threatened, act as ambassadors for what is happening in the natural world, says Green.

As well as being a powerful reminder of what we stand to lose, the book also points people towards potential solutions. Featured essays explore the benefits of rewilding and the importance of indigenous communities in conservation.

A chapter on endangered species from bees to blue whales illustrates the alarming threat climate change poses to animals outside of the “New Big 5.” “That’s only the tip of the iceberg – I could have included thousands of pictures because that’s how serious the situation is,” says Green.

""In Indian forests, it's very difficult to get a proper picture of a running tiger, as they all are thick forests. I kept the camera settings fast enough to freeze the running tiger,"" said photographer Thomas Vijayan in a press release. Thomas Vijayan/The New Big 5

Jane Goodall, a leading conservationist who also wrote the afterword to the book, said in a press release that “we have a window of time during which we can start to heal some of the harm we have inflicted on the natural world, but only if we get together and take action now.

“I hope the photos will lead people into the wonderful worlds of these iconic species. Then, perhaps, other people will become involved in helping to create a world where wildlife can flourish for future generations to enjoy,” she said.

A Syrian who arrived in Germany as a refugee in 2015 has won a mayoral election in the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg.

Ryyan Alshebl, who left his hometown of As Suwayda in Syria eight years ago, ran as an independent in the municipality of Ostelsheim. He won 55.41% of the votes on Sunday, beating two German candidates, Marco Strauss and Mathias Fey.

Locals cheered the 29-year-old when he welcomed his win, a victory he described as “sensational,” German local broadcaster SWR reported Monday.

“Today, Ostelsheim sent an example for broad-mindedness and cosmopolitanism for the whole of Germany,” he said, according to to German public broadcaster ZDF. “That’s not something that can be taken for granted in a conservative, rural area.”

Alshebl’s first call after his victory was to his mother in Syria, who was thrilled with the news, SWR reported.

The Association of Municipalities of Baden-Württemberg said Alshebl is the first man with Syrian roots to run for and win a mayor’s office. He will start his role in June.

Ostelsheim residents have welcomed their incoming mayor. “The fairy tale has come true, and the right man has become our mayor,” Annette Keck, who lives in the village, told SWR.

Strauss, one of his opponents, congratulated Alshebl. “I wish you good luck and at the same time ask for support for Mr. Alshebl, for our shared Ostelsheim,” he said on Facebook.

The state’s Integration Minister Manne Lucha said that Alshebl’s victory showed that diversity is a natural part of Baden-Württemberg. “I would be very pleased if Ryyan Alshebl’s election encourages more people with a migration history to run for political office,” he said.

Not everyone has been so warm to the 29-year-old. ZDF reported the Syrian received hateful comments on the campaign trail.

The young politician went from house to house, promoting his election program, and “the experiences were predominantly positive,” but there was also a minority of far-right fringe voters in Ostelsheim that did not want to accept him due to his Syrian roots, Alshebl told ZDF.

‘Investing in your future’

Born to a schoolteacher and agricultural engineer in Syria, Alshebl described his life as carefree until the age of 20, according to his campaign website.

At the time, protests against the Syrian government that began in 2011 soon devolved into chaotic war. The fighting and later rise of ISIS forced 10.6 million people from home by late 2015 – about half of Syria’s pre-war population.

Alshebl faced the dilemma of being drafted for military service with the Syrian army or leaving the country, according to his website.

While many Syrians were displaced internally or fled to countries in the region, others like Alshebl made the dangerous journey to Europe. He was 21 years old at the time, and said he crossed from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos in a rubber dinghy.

Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel had implemented a brief open-door policy in 2015 that saw the country take in about 1.2 million asylum seekers in the following years, including Alshebl.

The move sparked a backlash in Germany and the sudden growth of the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the wake of summer 2015.

Once in Germany, Alshebl lived close to Ostelsheim and said at the time he felt “there is only one thing you can do: get back on your feet quickly and start investing in your own future quickly.”

For the last seven years he worked in the administration of Althengstett town hall, in a neighboring town. He drew from his experience, he said in his campaign, and made digital access to to public administration services one of priorities. Flexible childcare and climate protections are also on his agenda.

Alshebl, who is a member of the Green Party and now has German citizenship, pledged during his campaign that once elected as mayor he would move to Ostelsheim.",2025-11-14T15:08:01.388998

A new study found a moderately higher risk of autism spectrum disorder in children born to pregnant people exposed to tap water with higher levels of lithium, but experts caution that this association does not show a direct link between the two.

About 1 in 36 children in the US is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) each year, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Scientists still don’t know the exact cause of autism, a developmental disorder. Genetics may be a factor, but some have been looking at potential environmental causes, too.

Cases may be on the rise, but that is also unclear. One study published this year on cases in the New York-New Jersey area found that autism diagnosis rates tripled among certain age groups between 2000 and 2016. A 2021 report found similar increases in cases, but the CDC says the increased number of cases is most likely linked to more doctors screening for the condition.

Lithium is an alkali metal that can be found naturally in some food and ground water. It’s used in batteries, grease and air conditioners, as well as in the treatment of bipolar disorder and some blood disorders. Its levels in US drinking water are not regulated, according to the US Geological Survey.

A new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found a small association between lithium and autism diagnosis in Denmark, where the researchers say the level of lithium in drinking water is similar to that in American water systems.

The researchers checked a database of people with psychiatric disorders for children born between 2000 and 2013 to find information on 8,842 cases of ASD and 43,864 participants who did not have ASD. They then measured the concentration of lithium in 151 public waterworks that served more than half of the Danish population and mapped out where pregnant people lived in relation.

As lithium levels in water increased, there was a modest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis. Specifically, compared with people at the lowest exposure level, those who had the second and third highest exposure during pregnancy had a 24% to 26% higher risk of ASD diagnosed in children. The group with the highest exposure had a 46% higher risk than those at the lowest level of exposure.

The researchers could not tell how much water the pregnant people drank, but they picked Denmark in part because residents there consume some of the lowest amounts of bottled water in Europe.

Experts say it’s important to note that the research can’t show that lithium exposure leads directly to an autism diagnosis.

Further study is required, said study co-author Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor of neurology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and a professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.

“Any drinking water contaminants that may affect the developing human brain deserve intense scrutiny,” Ritz said in a news release. She added that the research would need to be replicated in other countries to look for a similar connection.

The implications of the findings are complex as far as public health policy is concerned, according to an editorial published alongside the study. Lithium levels in water, at concentrations that the study associated with a potential ASD risk, have also been linked with health benefits such as lower rates of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders and suicide.

“If all these of associations are valid, the wisdom of Solomon will be required to develop guidelines for lithium in drinking water that are maximally protective of the entire population,” wrote Dr. David C. Bellinger, a professor of neurology and psychology at Harvard Medical School. “Until the basic biology of ASD is better understood, it will be difficult to distinguish causal from spurious associations.”

Dr. Max Wiznitzer, director of the Rainbow Autism Center at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, points to other research on the effects of lithium on pregnant people who take it for mental health disorders. Those studies – which look at people exposed to much higher levels than are found in drinking water – do not show a connection with autism spectrum disorder.

“It’s an interesting association, but causation is definitely not proven,” said Wiznitzer, who was not involved in the new research. “We have to see if there’s a viable and biologically plausible mechanism by which a small amount of lithium in the water supply can somehow do this, yet pharmacologic dosing of lithium in women with bipolar disorder has not been reported to be causing increased risk of ASD.”

Other studies have also suggested connections between ASD and environmental exposures to things like pesticides, air pollution and phthalates. But none of them points to any of these factors as a direct cause of the disorder.

A link between environmental exposure and ASD is hard to prove, Wiznitzer said. With research showing that increased exposure to air pollution raises the risk of giving birth to a child with ASD, for example, he often wonders whether pollution is the determining factor or if it’s just the populations who live in more polluted areas.

“There’s a lot of speculation about about environmental factors, but how many of them are truly causally associated?” Wiznitzer said. “We are bombarded with a variety of environmental stressors in our everyday lives. We have to figure out how to basically safely navigate them, and this is probably not one that’s high on our list.”",2025-11-14T15:08:03.829045

CNN —

Kwame Brathwaite, the pioneering activist and photographer whose work helped define the aesthetics of the “Black is Beautiful” movement of the 1960s and beyond, died on April 1, aged 85.

His son, Kwame Brathwaite, Jr, announced his father’s death in an Instagram post that read in part, “I am deeply saddened to share that my Baba, the patriarch of our family, our rock and my hero has transitioned.”

Brathwaite’s work has been the subject of resurgent interest from curators, historians and collectors in recent years, and his first major institutional retrospective, which was organized by the Aperture Foundation, made its debut in 2019 at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles before touring the country.

Kwame Brathwaite Cory Rice

Brathwaite was born in 1938 to Barbadian immigrants, in what he referred to as “the People’s Republic of Brooklyn” in New York, though his family moved from there to Harlem and then to the South Bronx when Brathwaite was 5 years old. He attended the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) and, according to profiles of Brathwaite in T Magazine and Vice, was drawn to photography by two moments. The first was in August of 1955, when a 17-year-old Brathwaite encountered David Jackson’s haunting photograph of a brutalized Emmett Till in his open casket. The second was in 1956, when — after he and his brother Elombe co-founded the African Jazz Arts Society and Studios (AJASS) — Brathwaite saw a young man taking photos in a dark jazz club without the use of a flash, and his mind became alight with possibility.

Using a Hasselblad medium-format camera, Brathwaite attempted to do the same, learning to work with limited light in a manner that enhanced the visual narrative of his imagery. He would soon also develop a darkroom technique that enriched and deepened how Black skin would appear in his photography, honing the practice in a small darkroom in his Harlem apartment. Brathwaite went on to photograph jazz legends performing throughout the 1950s and ’60s, including Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and others.

“You want to get the feeling, the mood that you’re experiencing when they’re playing,” Brathwaite told Aperture Magazine in 2017. “That’s the thing. You want to capture that.”

By the early 1960s, alongside the rest of AJASS, Brathwaite began using his photography and organizing prowess to consciously push back against whitewashed, Eurocentric beauty standards. The group came up with the concept of the Grandassa Models, young Black women whom Brathwaite would photograph, celebrating and accentuating their features. In 1962, AJASS organized “Naturally ’62”, a fashion show held in a Harlem club called the Purple Manor and featuring the models. The show would go on to be held regularly until 1992. In 1966, Brathwaite married his wife Sikolo, a Grandassa Model whom he had met on the street the year prior when he asked if he could take her portrait. The two remained married for the rest of Brathwaite’s life.

By the 1970s, Brathwaite’s focus on jazz shifted to other forms of popular Black music. In 1974, he traveled to Africa with the Jackson Five to document their tour, also photographing the historic “Rumble in the Jungle” boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in what’s now the Democratic Republic of Congo that same year. Commissions in this era also saw Brathwaite photographing Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, Bob Marley and other music legends.

Throughout the ensuing decades, Brathwaite continued to explore and develop his mode of photography, all through the lens of the “Black is Beautiful” ethos. In 2016, Brathwaite joined the roster of Philip Martin Gallery in Los Angeles, and he was continuing to photograph commissions as recently as 2018, when he shot artist and stylist Joanne Petit-Frère for The New Yorker.

T Magazine’s 2021 profile, published on the occasion of Brathwaite’s retrospective traveling to the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, noted that the photographer’s health was failing such that he was unable to be interviewed for the article. A separate exhibition, “Kwame Brathwaite: Things Well Worth Waiting For,” is currently on view at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it will remain until July 24.

Anthony Bourdain loved haggis. But even the late, great American chef, writer and television host recognized that Scotland’s national dish, with its “sinister sheep parts” wrapped in a shroud of mystery and half-invented history, could be a hard sell.

“Don’t let them tell you otherwise, that’s really one of life’s great pleasures,” Bourdain said on one of his gastro-curious pilgrimages to Glasgow. “There is no more unfairly reviled food on Earth than the haggis.”

A mash-up of diced lung, liver and heart mixed with oatmeal, beef suet, onion and assorted spices, haggis was traditionally made by stuffing these raw ingredients into the stomach of a recently slain sheep and boiling the lot to a state of palatability.

Instagrammable is not the word that immediately comes to mind. In our 21st-century world, where “clean” eating and processed pap overlap, haggis can seem like an “Outlander”-style outlier from another age.

Yet, by some alchemy, once cooked to its required “warm-reekin’ (steaming)” state, it adds up to much more than the sum of its modest parts. It’s offaly charm has kept nose-to-tail eating alive among a younger generation of Scots that has largely turned its back on the tripe, liver and kidneys their predecessors enjoyed (or endured).

Carefully prepared, haggis tastes both oaty and meaty; it is dark and crumbly, a little crispy at the edges but still moist; earthy but also savory and spicy; deep-tasting and profoundly warming, the perfect foil for its traditional garnish of floury mashed potatoes and orange bashed turnip.

“It’s like a cuddle for the stomach,” says Nicola Turner, a 35-year-old office administrator from Helensburgh, a town on western Scotland’s Firth of Clyde.

Spice and texture

For children of the 1960s and ’70s, like crime novelist Ian Rankin, haggis meals were a choice between the classic meat-and-two-veg plate and the battered and deep-fried, chip-shop iteration loved by both his friend Bourdain and his quintessentially Scottish detective character, Inspector John Rebus.

Now myriad other treatments have blossomed.

“I’m pretty sure the first time I dined with AB in Edinburgh we had haggis in filo pastry with a jam-style – maybe blackcurrant – sauce,” Rankin recalled. “He was a big fan of haggis and of chip shops. Rebus will have enjoyed the occasional haggis supper from his local chip shop. He was definitely a fan, as am I.”

“It is all about the spicing and the texture,” says the Scottish food writer, novelist and cook Sue Lawrence, a champion of haggis’ adaptability for use in other dishes. “If you didn’t know what was in it, you wouldn’t think ‘oh that tastes of liver or whatever.’ It is all nicely chopped up and the oatmeal gives it a lovely texture. It could easily be a nice, big mince dish.”

Lawrence uses haggis as an alternative to beef and pork ragù in lasagna and in her pastilla, a version of the North African dish in which a hand-made haggis from the Isle of Mull substitutes for the traditional poultry or seafood filling. The filo pastry savory is flavored with the spice blend ras el hanout, apricots, chile, orange zest and almonds before being sprinkled with cinnamon and icing sugar.

Such cultural crossovers serve as a reminder that haggis could easily be a dish with nothing specifically Scottish about it at all. Records of similar quick and portable preparations of the fast-perishing innards of sheep and other animals date back to ancient Rome and Greece.

Haggis-like combinations of offal and grains are part of the culinary history of several countries. Spain has chireta, Romania drob and Sweden polsa, while chaudin, or ponce, is a rice and meat-stuffed pig stomach that is a staple of Cajun cooking.

In neighboring England, recipes for “hagese,” “hagws of a schepe,” “haggas” or “haggus” pop up in recipe books published between the 15th and 17th centuries, probably preceding written records north of the border.

Etymological evidence points to the term “haggis” having its roots in Old Norse, suggesting an early version of an oat-and-offal sausage might have arrived in Britain and Ireland on a Viking longboat.

But ever since it was first optioned by the poet Robert Burns in the late 1700s, the haggis backstory has been monopolized by Scotland and the Scots, sometimes mischievously.

It is, according to the kind of lore that Burns engendered, the dish a doughty Highlander would carry with him as he drove cattle through the glens to the markets of the central belt or the perfect picnic for a whisky smuggler plying his illicit trade by moonlight.

From such romantic notions it was a short step to turning the haggis into a wee wild beastie, one with longer legs on one side that was thus condemned to run round and round whichever hill it lived on. In 2003, a poll of American tourists in Scotland found that one in three of them believed they might encounter such a confused creature on a Caledonian vacation.

Bourdain, a native New Yorker, may have qualified as haggis’ biggest admirer since Burns, but his compatriots at the US Department of Agriculture remain unconverted to offal-filled paunch. Haggis imports into the United States were prohibited in 1971 as part of a ban on the consumption of all livestock lungs. Authentic versions of old school haggis remain culinary contraband in the US, as hard to lay your hands on as Cuban cigars.

Across the rest of the world, it’s a different story. According to leading producer Simon Howie, haggis is more widely appreciated and consumed now than it has been since Burns improvised his “Address to a Haggis” for the entertainment of well-to-do Edinburgh acquaintances.

Pudding chieftan

Firmly tongue-in-cheek, the poem lauds the “Great chieftain o’ the pudding race,” as exactly the kind of unpretentious, hearty fare required to nourish a nation of braveheart warriors.

In comparison to the enfeebling foreign muck enjoyed by the capital’s claret-quaffing elites of the time – the olio, fricassée or ragoût that would “sicken a sow” – Burns urges his readers to wonder at the magical impact of haggis on his fellow sons of Scotland’s soil.

As the English translation of the original Scots language version puts it:

But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed/

The trembling earth resounds his tread/

Clap in his ample fist a blade/

He’ll make it whistle/

And legs and arms and heads will cut/

Off like the heads of thistles

These days synthetic casings have largely replaced stomach but ovine and porcine innards remain at the core of most of the haggis produced in its homeland, said Howie, who estimates that his company Simon Howie Butchers, accounts for around 60% of the roughly two million haggises produced every year.

For Howie, versatility, value for money and convenience explain why this staple of the Scottish larder is thriving. Typically haggis retails in Scotland, which accounts for half of global consumption by volume, for around £6, or $7.70 per kilogram ($3.36/pound). That’s around half the price of less expensive cuts of beef or a third of the price of Scotch lamb while enjoying a fairly similar nutritional and calorific profile.

“You can give your kids a meal that is not full of things you don’t want to feed them – for a few pounds you can feed three strapping lads,” Howie said.

“From a kitchen perspective, it is very simple because when it leaves our factory it is already cooked. So when you or a restaurant owner gets it into the kitchen all you have to do is heat it up to be piping hot. It couldn’t be more basic: a student with no cooking skills or a Michelin-starred chef do exactly the same thing to put it out on the plate.”

Its texture means haggis can also be usefully deployed in fine dining alongside leaner meat like venison or as a stuffing for poultry and game birds. Its spicy intensity means it is also finding uses in canapés and as a crouton-borne garnish for soups.

Buoyant sales are also underpinned by the increasing consumption of haggis in forms inspired by Scotland’s ethnic minorities.

Glasgow’s Sikh community pioneered haggis pakora in the 1990s and samosas, spring rolls and quesadillas have followed in its wake, often using a vegetarian version of the protein in which the offal is replaced by a mix of vegetables, pulses and mushrooms.

Such dishes are more than culinary twists. They are badges of belonging, and an indication that, two centuries after Burns grabbed it for the nation, haggis is as intimately entwined with Scots identity as ever.

Just ask Ross O’Cinneide, a promising 14-year-old fly-half in the junior section of Stirling County rugby club.

“Most of my friends and I like haggis,” he says. “Mum makes it for us sometimes after rugby and it’s got a very nice warming feeling. And it’s nice because it’s purely Scottish.”",2025-11-14T15:08:09.034777

Some VIP Twitter users woke up on Saturday expecting to have lost their coveted blue verification check marks in a previously announced purge by Elon Musk. Instead, Twitter appeared to target a single account from a major publication Musk dislikes and changed the language on its site in a way that obscures why users are verified.

Twitter had said it would “begin winding down” blue checks granted under its old verification system — which emphasized protecting high-profile users at risk of impersonation — on April 1. In order to stay verified, Musk said, users would have to pay $8 per month to join the platform’s Twitter Blue subscription service, which has allowed accounts to pay for verification since December.

Most legacy blue check holders found this weekend that their verification marks had not disappeared, but rather had been appended with a new label reading: “This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account.” The language, which shows up when users click on the check mark, makes it unclear whether verified accounts are actually notable individuals or simply users who have paid to join Twitter Blue.

But one high-profile account did lose its blue check over the weekend: the main account for the New York Times, which had previously told CNN it would not pay for verification.

After an account that often engages with Musk posted a meme this weekend about the Times declining to pay for verification, Musk responded in a tweet saying, “Oh ok, we’ll take it off then.” Musk then lashed out at the Times — just the latest instance of the billionaire slamming journalists or media outlets — in a series of tweets that claimed the outlet’s coverage is boring and “propaganda.”

The weekend moves are just the latest example of Twitter creating confusion and whiplash for users over feature changes — and in this case, not just any users, but many of the most high-profile accounts that have long been a key selling point for the platform. It also highlights how Musk often appears to guide decisions about the platform more by whims than by policy.

Although the New York Times’ main account lost its blue check, its other accounts, such as those for its arts, travel and books content, remained verified. (It’s not clear why the New York Times doesn’t have a gold “organizations” check mark, like accounts for other news outlets, including the Associated Press and the Washington Post.) After its blue check was removed, a spokesperson for the New York Times reiterated to CNN that it does not plan to pay for verification.

Twitter, which laid off most of its public relations staff last fall, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a separate puzzling move, Twitter’s blue bird logo at the top of the site was replaced on Monday with doge, the meme representing the cryptocurrency dogecoin, which Musk has promoted. The price of dogecoin shot up 20% on Monday.

Musk’s long campaign against “legacy” blue checks

Musk has been threatening to take away “legacy” blue check marks from users verified under Twitter’s old system since shortly after he bought Twitter last fall.

In early November, Twitter launched the option for people paying for its Twitter Blue subscription service to receive blue checks. The program was quickly put on pause after being plagued by a wave of celebrity and corporate impersonators, and was relaunched in December.

Twitter also rolled out a color-coded verification system with differently colored marks for companies and government entities, but Musk continued to say that individual users would eventually have to pay for blue checks.

In the days leading up to the blue check purge that wasn’t, prominent users such as actor William Shatner and anti-bullying activist Monica Lewinksy pushed back against the idea that, as power users that draw attention to the site, they should have to pay for a feature that keeps them safe from impersonation.

By muddying the reason accounts are verified, the new label could risk making it easier for people to scam or impersonate high-profile users. Experts in inauthentic behavior have also said it’s not clear that reserving verification for paid users will reduce the number of bots on the site, an issue Musk has raised on and off over the past year.

Musk, for his part, has previously presented changes to Twitter’s verification system as a way of “treating everyone equally.”

“There shouldn’t be a different standard for celebrities,” he said in a tweet last week. The paid feature could also drive revenue, which could help Musk, who is on the hook for significant debt after buying Twitter for $44 billion.

Musk last week also said that starting on April 15, only verified accounts would be recommended in users’ “For You” feeds alongside the accounts they follow.

Bruce Willis’ wife, Emma Heming Willis, has celebrated their elder daughter’s birthday with a trip down memory lane.

Mabel Willis turned 11 on Sunday, and her proud mom marked the occasion by sharing a montage of family photos and videos taken over the years, set to the song “Pictures Of You” by The Cure.

“Happy 11th Birthday Mabel Ray!” Heming Willis wrote in the caption.

“Your energy is infectious,” she continued, praising her little girl for the way she “can light a whole room with your smile and warmth.”

“How you love and care for your family and friends is beautiful to witness. Keep shining my love and always remember to #liveitup,” Heming Willis added.

Heming Willis and Willis married in 2009. Along with Mabel, the couple also have an 8-year-old daughter, Evelyn. Willis also has daughters Rumer, Scout and Tallulah with his ex-wife, Demi Moore.

Willis is clearly a doting dad. One picture in Heming Willis’ montage shows the “Die Hard” star holding baby Mabel while planting a kiss on her forehead, while a more recent image shows a beaming Willis hanging out in nature with his preteen.

Heming Willis penned an equally heartfelt tribute last month when her husband celebrated his 68th birthday. Sharing a video montage on Instagram, she referred to the actor as “pure love.”

In February, Willis’ family announced that his speaking disorder, aphasia, had progressed into a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, or FTD.

“Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead,” they said in an update shared online. “As Bruce’s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research.”

According to the Alzheimer’s Association, FTD refers to “a group of disorders caused by progressive nerve cell loss in the brain’s frontal lobes (the areas behind your forehead) or its temporal lobes.” These areas of the brain are generally associated with personality, behavior and language.",2025-11-14T15:08:16.771079

Paris Saint-Germain’s miserable season went from bad to worse on Sunday as the team suffered a second straight home defeat with a 1-0 loss to Lyon.

Even before the game kicked off, Lionel Messi bore the brunt of the frustrations of some PSG fans who whistled when his name appeared on the big screen during the announcement of the starting lineup.

After Alexadre Lacazette missed a first-half penalty, Bradley Barcola’s goal 10 minutes into the second period was enough to earn Lyon the three points on a night that PSG rarely looked like threatening the visiting goal.

Lens’ 1-0 victory over Rennes and Marseille’s 1-1 draw with Montepellier means both teams are now just six points behind PSG at the top of Ligue 1, and even the domestic title may slip from the team’s grasp.

The reaction of some fans on Sunday must have felt a world away from the adulation and worship Messi received during his recent return to Argentina for friendlies against Panama and Curaçao as the country continued its World Cup celebrations.

So far, the only major trophy the team has won since Messi joined was Ligue 1 last season, a title – it’s fair to say – PSG would likely have won without him.

Messi has 34 goal contributions in all competitions for PSG this season – 18 goals and 17 assists – second only to Mbappé’s 38 and head coach Christophe Galtier refused to lay the blame for the team’s failures at the Argentine’s feet.

“I found it [the jeering] hard to listen to,” Galtier told reporters, per the Athletic. “There may be expectations for Messi and Mbappe to unlock difficult situations. Messi tries very hard, they didn’t all work out; but around him, the other players also need to do their jobs.”

“We can’t expect everything from Leo and Kylian,” he added.

Up next for PSG is a season-defining week as Galtier’s side travels to a Nice team that is unbeaten in 13 matches, before hosting Lens at the Parc des Princes.

PSG has lost two of its three matches since being dumped out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich last month, and only limped past relegation-threatened Brest with a 90th minute Kylian Mbappé winner.

After his team’s victory, Lyon head coach Laurent Blanc said the Champions League or bust mentality has been detrimental to PSG’s performances.

“Paris’ problem is when the No. 1 objective of the Champions League is no longer accessible, it seems that the season no longer exists – and at all levels,” he told reporters.",2025-11-14T15:08:19.478589

It was just six months ago that Graham Potter was deemed the man to usher in a fresh, exciting era at Chelsea.

The club’s new ownership group, led by American businessman Todd Boehly, had enticed Potter away from Brighton with the promise of managing one of the most lucrative teams in world soccer.

More than $600 million was spent on bringing big-name players to the club and Potter, one of the most exciting young managers in the Premier League, was to mold them into a winning machine.

But, on Sunday, the club announced that it had sacked its manager after an underwhelming spell in charge.

Potter managed to win just 10 of the 28 league matches this season and leaves the team 11th in the Premier League table.

In recent weeks, players had looked a shadow of their former selves and many fans had lost confidence that Potter’s plan for the club could ever work.

Eventually, after previously sticking by its manager, Blues ownership agreed.

“On behalf of everyone at the club, we want to thank Graham sincerely for his contribution to Chelsea,” the club’s co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali said in a statement.

“We have the highest degree of respect for Graham as a coach and as a person. He has always conducted himself with professionalism and integrity and we are all disappointed in this outcome.”

In his previous role as Brighton manager, Potter was given time to stamp his identity on the squad.

The club was punching above its weight financially and, as a result, carefully selected new signings which would compliment Potter’s style of play.

The approach paid off as the team became an established Premier League outfit which has gone on to greater things this season – the Seagulls currently sit sixth in the league and in the UEFA Conference League qualification spot.

At Chelsea, it seemed the complete opposite.

As was the case under previous owner Roman Abramovich, the club expected instant results and used its financial weight to sign a number of high-profile names, including the likes of Enzo Fernández and Mykhailo Mudryk.

Despite his impressive CV, Potter had never managed superstars and suddenly found himself in a changing room with multiple.

The scatter gun approach to recruitment also left the team lacking balance and organization with Potter failing to get a tune out of a team busting with talent.

Premier League record

In truth, many had raised an eyebrow when Potter, inexperienced at the very top level, was chosen to replace Thomas Tuchel as manager.

Despite falling out of favor with fans by the end of his tenure, Tuchel had guided Chelsea to the Champions League title in 2021 and is still considered by many as one of the best coaches in the world.

The German has gone on to sign with Bavarian giant Bayern Munich through the 2024/25 season and recently told reporters he needed “quite a bit of time to distance himself from Chelsea” because leaving the club had hurt him.

“Todd [Boehly] said he would be different to Roman [Abramovich],” former Liverpool player and current pundit Jamie Carragher wrote on Twitter.

“I feel for Graham Potter, but it was inevitable. You don’t change Tuchel for Potter. Ridiculous decision to start with.”

With 10 games left in the league and a Champions League quarterfinal against Real Madrid on the horizon, Chelsea still has plenty to play for.

Assistant coach Bruno Saltor will take over on an interim basis, but Boehly and his team must now look for a long-term replacement capable – and willing – to bring order to Chelsea’s chaos.

Potter’s sacking is yet another sign of just how transient managers can be in the top-flight of English football, especially when results aren’t instantaneous.

There has now been a record 12 sackings in the Premier League so far this season, with Potter leaving his position the same day Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers was sacked from his.

The previous record was 10 manager changes in a single season, set in four other campaigns, most recently in 2017/18.",2025-11-14T15:08:21.605547

LSU star Angel Reese defended the gesture she aimed at Iowa Hawkeyes’ Caitlin Clark near the end of the Tigers’ first NCAA women’s basketball national championship victory on Sunday, saying “I don’t take disrespect lightly.”

Reese could be seen approaching Clark before moving her open hand in front of her face – popularized by WWE star John Cena to mean “you can’t see me” – before pointing to her ring finger in a gesture some interpreted as a reference to the place her newly-acquired championship ring might sit.

Clark made a similar gesture to another player earlier in the tournament.

The gesture has sparked much debate, especially on social media. Some have criticized Reese, while others have defended her actions, highlighting how there was no public outrage in response to Clark’s gesture earlier in the tournament.

Sports journalist Jose de Jesus Ortiz called Reese’s actions “classless,” while former ESPN host Keith Olbermann called Reese an “idiot” for the gesture.

In the press conference after the victory, Reese referenced the difference in reaction she received as a result of her gesture as compared to the one Clark received.

“All year, I was critiqued for who I was. I don’t fit the narrative,” Reese said. “I don’t fit the box that y’all want me to be in. I’m too hood. I’m too ghetto. Y’all told me that all year. But when other people do it, and y’all don’t say nothing.

“So this is for the girls that look like me. For those that want to speak up for what they believe in. It’s unapologetically you. And that’s what I did it for tonight. It was bigger than me tonight. And Twitter is going to go into a rage every time.

“And I’m happy. I feel like I’ve helped grow women’s basketball this year. (…) I’m looking forward to celebrating and then next season.”

Reese had 15 points and 10 rebounds in the 102-85 victory and won the women’s March Madness’ Most Outstanding Player award.

In the post-game broadcast, Reese referenced the similar gesture Clark made to a Louisville opponent in the Elite Eight.

In the same game, Clark said to an opponent: “You’re down by 15 points. Shut up,” according to the Bleacher Report.

“Caitlin Clark is a hell of a player but I don’t take disrespect lightly,” Reese said. “She disrespected [LSU’s] Alexis [Morris] (…) and I wanted to pick her pocket. But I had a moment at the end of her game. I was in my bag, I was in my moment.”

After the Championship game, Clark herself said she didn’t notice anything at the time.

“I was just trying to get to the handshake line and shake hands and be grateful that my team was in that position,” Clark said in the post-game press conference. “All the credit in the world to LSU. They were tremendous. They deserve it. They had a tremendous season.

“(LSU head coach) Kim Mulkey coached them so, so well. She’s one of the best basketball coaches of all time, and it shows. She only said really kind things to me in the handshake line, so I’m very grateful of that too.

“But honestly I have no idea. I was just trying to spend the last few moments on the court with especially the five people that I’ve started 93 games with and relishing every second of that.”

LSU head coach Mulkey said she had “no clue” about what transpired.

Among those defending Reese on social media were ESPN’s Holly Rowe and former NBA star Etan Thomas.

“People hating on Angel Reese or Caitlin Clark. Stop. Unapologetically confident young women should be celebrated NOT hated. Get used to it,” Rowe wrote on Twitter.

Former Washington Wizards, Oklahoma City Thunder and Atlanta Hawks player Thomas wrote: “Hold on now!!!! It was cute when Caitlin Clark did it. Y’all didn’t have any issues with it at all. So don’t be all outraged and talking about class and sportsmanship when Angel Reese does the same thing. We’re not doing double standards here.”

Reese said the negative reaction on social media throughout the season has helped fuel her excellent season, having finished averaging 23.0 points and 15.4 rebounds in her first season with LSU after transferring from Maryland.

“Twitter can say what they want to say,” she said. “I love reading those comments. I have all the screenshots of what everybody has said about me all season. What are you going to say now?”",2025-11-14T15:08:25.972120

Sixteen-year-old Summer McIntosh broke the world record for the 400m individual medley at the Canadian swimming trials on Saturday – just days after breaking the world record for the 400m freestyle.

McIntosh finished the 400m individual medley in a time of 4:25.87, breaking the mark set at the 2016 Rio Olympics by Hungarian swimmer Katinka Hosszú with a time of 4:26.36.

The result continues the teenager’s brilliant week after she broke the 400m freestyle world record last Tuesday – breaking defending Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus’ previous record of 3:56.40, which was set last May, in a time of 3:56.08.

Speaking after her latest triumph, McIntosh shared her emotions.

“That’s the first time I really vividly heard the crowd during my race,” McIntosh said, per Reuters.

“It’s amazing to have all my family and friends in the stands, cheering me on. It really helped me in the last 100 meters.”

CNN —

Slumped on his club, head buried in his arm, Rory McIlroy looked on the verge of tears.

The then-21-year-old had just watched his ball sink into the waters of Rae’s Creek at Augusta National and with it, his dream of winning The Masters, a dream that had looked so tantalizingly close mere hours earlier.

As a four-time major winner and one of the most decorated names in the sport’s history, few players would turn down the chance to swap places with McIlroy heading into Augusta this week.

Yet on Sunday afternoon of April 10, 2011, not a golfer in the world would have wished to be in the Northern Irishman’s shoes.

Flying

A fresh-faced, mop-headed McIlroy had touched down in Georgia for the first major of the season with a reputation as the leading light of the next generation of stars.

An excellent 2010 had marked his best season since turning pro three years earlier, highlighted by a first PGA Tour win at the Quail Hollow Championship and a crucial contribution to Team Europe’s triumph at the Ryder Cup.

Yet despite a pair of impressive top-three finishes at the Open and PGA Championship respectively, a disappointing missed cut at The Masters – his first at a major – served as ominous foreshadowing.

McIlroy shot 74 and 77 to fall four strokes short of the cut line at seven-over par, a performance that concerned him enough to take a brief sabbatical from competition.

But one year on in 2011, any lingering Masters demons looked to have been exorcised as McIlroy flew round the Augusta fairways.

Having opened with a bogey-free seven-under 65 – the first time he had ever shot in the 60s at the major – McIlroy pulled ahead from Spanish first round co-leader Alvaro Quirós with a second round 69.

It sent him into the weekend holding a two-shot cushion over Australia’s Jason Day, with Tiger Woods a further stroke behind and back in the hunt for a 15th major after a surging second round 66.

And yet the 21-year-old leader looked perfectly at ease with having a target on his back. Even after a tentative start to the third round, McIlroy rallied with three birdies across the closing six holes to stretch his lead to four strokes heading into Sunday.

The youngster was out on his own ahead of a bunched chasing pack comprising Day, Ángel Cabrera, K.J. Choi and Charl Schwartzel. After 54 holes, McIlroy had shot just three bogeys.

“It’s a great position to be in … I’m finally feeling comfortable on this golf course,” McIlroy told reporters.

“I’m not getting ahead of myself, I know how leads can dwindle away very quickly. I have to go out there, not take anything for granted and go out and play as hard as I’ve played the last three days. If I can do that, hopefully things will go my way.

“We’ll see what happens tomorrow because four shots on this golf course isn’t that much.”

Falling

The truth can hurt, and McIlroy was about to prove his assessment of Augusta to be true in the most excruciating way imaginable.

His fourth bogey of the week arrived immediately. Having admitted to expecting some nerves at the first tee, McIlroy sparked a booming opening drive down the fairway, only to miss his putt from five feet.

Three consecutive pars steadied the ship, but Schwartzel had the wind in his sails. A blistering birdie, par, eagle start had seen him draw level at the summit after his third hole.

A subsequent bogey from the South African slowed his charge, as McIlroy clung onto a one-shot lead at the turn from Schwartzel, Cabrera, Choi, and a rampaging Woods, who shot five birdies and an eagle across the front nine to send Augusta into a frenzy.

Despite his dwindling advantage and the raucous Tiger-mania din ahead of him, McIlroy had responded well to another bogey at the 5th hole, draining a brilliant 20-foot putt at the 7th to restore his lead.

The fist pump that followed marked the high-water point of McIlroy’s round, as a sliding start accelerated into full-blown free-fall at the par-four 10th hole.

His tee shot went careening into a tree, ricocheting to settle between the white cabins that separate the main course from the adjacent par-three course. It offered viewers a glimpse at a part of Augusta rarely seen on broadcast, followed by pictures of McIlroy anxiously peering out from behind a tree to track his follow-up shot.

Though his initial escape was successful, yet another collision with a tree and a two-putt on the green saw a stunned McIlroy eventually tap in for a triple bogey. Having led the field one hole and seven shots earlier, he arrived at the 11th tee in seventh.

By the time his tee drive at the 13th plopped into the creek, all thoughts of who might be the recipient of the green jacket had long-since switched away from the anguished youngster. It had taken him seven putts to navigate the previous two greens, as a bogey and a double bogey dropped him to five-under – the score he had held after just 11 holes of the tournament.

Mercifully, the last five holes passed without major incident. A missed putt for birdie from five feet at the final hole summed up McIlroy’s day, though he was given a rousing reception as he left the green.

Mere minutes earlier, the same crowd had erupted as Schwartzel sunk his fourth consecutive birdie to seal his first major title. After starting the day four shots adrift of McIlroy, the South African finished 10 shots ahead of him, and two ahead of second-placed Australian duo Jason Day and Adam Scott.

McIlroy’s eight-over 80 marked the highest score of the round. Having headlined the leaderboard for most of the week, he finished tied-15th.

Bounce-back

Tears would flow during a phone call with his parents the following morning, but at his press conference, McIlroy was upbeat.

“I’m very disappointed at the minute, and I’m sure I will be for the next few days, but I’ll get over it,” he said.

“I was leading this golf tournament with nine holes to go, and I just unraveled … It’s a Sunday at a major, what it can do.

“This is my first experience at it, and hopefully the next time I’m in this position I’ll be able to handle it a little better. I didn’t handle it particularly well today obviously, but it was a character-building day … I’ll come out stronger for it.”

Once again, McIlroy would be proven right.

Just eight weeks later in June, McIlroy rampaged to an eight-shot victory at the US Open. Records tumbled in his wake at Congressional, as he shot a tournament record 16-under 268 to become the youngest major winner since Tiger Woods at The Masters in 1997.

The historic victory kickstarted a golden era for McIlroy. After coasting to another eight-shot win at the PGA Championship in 2012, McIlroy became only the third golfer since 1934 to win three majors by the age of 25 with triumph at the 2014 Open Championship.

Before the year was out, he would add his fourth major title with another PGA Championship win.

And much of it was owed to that fateful afternoon at Augusta. In an interview with the BBC in 2015, McIlroy dubbed it “the most important day” of his career.

“If I had not had the whole unravelling, if I had just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one, I would not have learned as much.

“Luckily, it did not take me long to get into a position like that again when I was leading a major and I was able to get over the line quite comfortably. It was a huge learning curve for me and I needed it, and thankfully I have been able to move on to bigger and better things.

“Looking back on what happened in 2011, it doesn’t seem as bad when you have four majors on your mantelpiece.”

The missing piece

McIlroy’s contentment came with a caveat: it would be “unthinkable” if he did not win The Masters in his career.

Yet as he prepares for his 15th appearance at Augusta National this week, a green jacket remains an elusive missing item from his wardrobe.

Despite seven top-10 finishes in his past 10 Masters outings, the trophy remains the only thing separating McIlroy from joining the ranks of golf immortals to have completed golf’s career grand slam of all four majors in the modern era: Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods.

A runner-up finish to Scottie Scheffler last year marked McIlroy’s best finish at Augusta, yet arguably 2011 remains the closest he has ever been to victory. A slow start in 2022 meant McIlroy had begun Sunday’s deciding round 10 shots adrift of the American, who teed off for his final hole with a five-shot lead despite McIlroy’s brilliant 64 finish.

At 33 years old, time is still on his side. Though 2022 extended his major drought to eight years, it featured arguably his best golf since that golden season in 2014.

The University of Connecticut won its fifth men’s basketball national title with a 76-59 victory over San Diego State University on Monday night at NRG Stadium in Houston.

Senior guard Tristen Newton led UConn (31-8) with 19 points and 10 rebounds while Final Four Most Outstanding Player Adama Sanogo, a junior forward, chipped in with 17 points and 10 rebounds.

“We weren’t ranked going into the year so we had the chip on our shoulder,” UConn head coach Dan Hurley told game broadcaster CBS. “We knew the level that we could play at, even through those dark times,” he added, referencing the team’s six losses in eight games during the regular season.

He said going into the tournament his group had confidence garnered during the season.

“And when you have the type of leaders like Andre Jackson (game-high six assists Monday) and Adama Sanogo, they kept this team together, got us back on track and we knew we were the best team in the tournament going in and we just had to play to our level,” he added.

San Diego State (32-7) was topped by Keshad Johnson who had 14 points.

UConn trailed very early but San Diego State was undone by an 11-minute, eight-second stretch in which they scored just five free throws and missed 12 consecutive shots from the field. The Huskies went from down 10-6 to up 36-24 at halftime.

The Aztecs made a run midway through the second half and narrowed the deficit to five at 60-55 with 5:19 to play but the Huskies scored the next nine to take a comfortable lead into the final two minutes.

“We battled. Battled back to five in the second half, but gave them too much separation,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. “We had to be at our best. We weren’t at our best. A lot had to do with UConn.”

Senior guard Adam Seiko told reporters they gave themselves a chance with their second half comeback but UConn “just made a little bit more plays” at the end.

“They have a lot of weapons. They were pretty good,” said Matt Bradley, also a senior guard. “To beat them, we had to make shots. I shot poorly. And you had to have a really good game to beat those dudes on the offensive end.”

UConn won each of its six tournament games by at least 10 points, with its closest game being a 13-point win over the University of Miami in the national semifinals.

“I just want to thank my teammates, my coaches who believed in me. If it were not for them I would not be here right now,” Sanogo told CBS.

Jordan Hawkins, who scored 16 points for UConn, talked about winning the crown one day after his cousin, Angel Reese of Louisiana State University, won the women’s title.

“I mean it’s absolutely amazing that we both get this opportunity and I mean the family reunion is going to be great so that’s all I know,” he said.

UConn enters rarefied air as only the sixth team to win five NCAA men’s basketball championships, joining UCLA (11), Kentucky (eight), North Carolina (six), Duke (five) and Indiana (five). All of UConn’s titles have come since 1999 with the most recent before Monday occurring in 2014.

Shania Twain is standing up for others in country music.

The legendary star in the genre used her acceptance speech for the Equal Play Award at Sunday’s CMT Awards to call for more equity and diversity in the country music industry.

“When I wrote the phrase ‘Man I feel like a woman’ I honestly had no idea at the time it would become an undercurrent of a decades-long career,” she said, referring to one of her biggest hits. “It’s amazing how one statement can empower so many.”

The phrase, Twain said, “has been adopted by an array of fantastic communities all around the world and become a genuine path of power…which brings me so much joy.”

“I believe in an all-inclusive country music. We’re family,” Twain said. “This is a genre of music with a rich history that raised and nurtured my own songwriting and performance and recording career from childhood. Currently, the industry standard does a real disservice to this.”

Twain, who was presented the award by rapper Megan Thee Stallion, shouted out some of the diverse acts she is spotlighting on her “Queen of Me” tour this year, including Lily Rose, Lindsay Ell, Hailey Whitters, Mickey Guyton and others.

“I will continue to do my best as a trailblazer,” Twain said. “Together, let’s ensure all our fellow artists get equal play regardless of gender, age or race.”

She also performed acappella with the African American singing group, The BoykinZ, while presenting an award onstage. Twain connected with the group, who are sisters and rising country stars, after Kelly Clarkson surprised them recently by bringing Twain out to meet them during an episode of Clarkson’s daytime talk show.",2025-11-14T15:08:38.484592

Facebook Jon Ruben admitted 17 offences at Leicester Crown Court on Friday

A man who laced sweets with tranquilliser and gave them to children at a summer camp in Leicestershire has admitted sexual offences against two boys under 13. Jon Ruben was arrested after eight children and one adult fell ill at Stathern Lodge in July. The 76-year-old, from Ruddington in Nottinghamshire, pleaded guilty to a total of 17 charges when he appeared at Leicester Crown Court on Friday. However, he denied one of the sexual offences he was charged with, which was against a boy under 13.

Ruben was remanded in custody ahead of a further hearing on 28 November.

'Sweet game'

Mary Prior KC, prosecuting, outlined Ruben's offending to the court. She said his victims were under-privileged children who were staying at a summer camp which he ran. Ruben played a ""sweet game"" with the children, Mrs Prior KC said, in which he would go into the boys' rooms when they were getting ready for bed and ask them to eat sweets ""as quickly as they can"". She told the court Ruben had played this game with the boys ""for many years"", and children had previously fallen ill the following morning. She said Ruben had been able to explain this away as the children being ""overwrought by enjoyment"", until his stepson had concerns in July 2025. Mrs Prior KC added: ""This year his stepson had concerns about what was going on, for good reason. ""They decided to have a look in the defendant's belongings.""

Mrs Prior KC said items including baby oil, Vaseline and syringes were found, and his stepson notified the police about his concerns. She said Ruben went on to play the ""sweet game"" with six boys that night - Saturday 26 July - and they were all ill the following morning. ""The police had not gone out by that stage,"" she added. The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), previously told the BBC it was investigating Leicestershire Police's handling of the incident. Mrs Prior said the children were having difficulty walking due to being ill, so Ruben's stepson called the police again. She said Ruben then played the ""sweet game"" in a room of five children.",2025-11-14T17:32:36.047861

Met Police Chao Xu is believed to have sexually assaulted more women and police are urging them to come forward

A serial rapist thought to be ""one of the most prolific sex offenders of all time"" who drugged, raped and secretly filmed his victims has been sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 14 years. Chao Xu, a Chinese national, pleaded guilty to 24 sexual offences, including sexual assault, voyeurism and upskirting against six women between November 2021 and June 2025. Sentencing Xu at Woolwich Crown Court, Judge Christopher Grout described him as a ""sexual predator"" and ""an incredibly dangerous man"". One of the women he targeted told the court that she would ""never be able to forget"" what Xu did to her. Police are appealing for any more of his victims to come forward.

'Out of control'

Xu, 33, hosted networking events at his flat in Greenwich, south-east London, where he spiked drinks and raped some of the women who attended, detectives said. They found videos on his devices in which he had recorded himself raping women who seemed incapacitated or unconscious. He set up secret cameras in an air-freshener and in a speaker to film people showering, using the toilet and getting changed. Police found that he had made ""compilations"" from his voyeuristic activities, editing together recordings of him raping women who were incapacitated. ""Upon forensic examination of Xu's phone, officers uncovered deeply disturbing material,"" Acting Det Supt Lewis Sanderson said. ""The device contained videos and images taken from a point-of-view perspective, showing Xu raping and seriously sexually assaulting women who appear to be unconscious or heavily incapacitated."" The detective added: ""We believe he is one of the most prolific sex offenders of all time.""

Met Police A picture Xu took of himself installing hidden camera

One victim told the court: ""I don't think I will ever be the same person again. ""I am afraid that I will never be able to forget what that man did to me and how he stole the person I was. ""I fear that I may have introduced Xu to other women who may have suffered the same fate as me. I carry that too. ""I felt out of control and so very alone. I have been told that the drugs he used on me are for animals."" She described how despite being drugged she was conscious enough to know what was happening to her.

""The terrifying thing had been that I couldn't open my eyes and mouth,"" she told the court. ""Nor could I move my body. I felt everything that he did, pulling my dress off and touching me intimately. I was horrified. ""I could just see through my eyes every now and then that he had his phone out. I just couldn't understand why he was doing that to me. ""He was supposed to be a friend.""

'Overwhelming fear'

Xu was apprehended following a social event at his residence in Glashier Street, Greenwich, in May, when he raped a guest who was later found to have very strong sedative drugs in her system. After she regained consciousness, the victim recalled parts of the attack, including Xu filming on his mobile device.

AFP via Getty Images It is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, say aid groups and the G7

The UN human rights council has given unanimous backing to a fresh, independent investigation into mass killings reported in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher. ""Our wake-up calls were not heeded. Bloodstains on the ground in el-Fasher have been photographed from space. The stain on the record of the international community is less visible, but no less damaging,"" UN human rights chief Volker Türk said at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Friday. Since the civil war began over two years ago, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have been forced from their homes. The new investigation is mandated to identify those who ordered and carried out the massacre in el-Fasher.

The findings could be shared with the International Criminal Court. While Türk did warn individuals and companies ""fuelling and profiting"" from Sudan's war, there is disappointment that the mandate makes no mention of other countries sponsoring the conflict. The UAE is accused of shipping weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group, while Iran has been accused of supplying some weapons to the Sudanese army. Plus, there is concern that the cash-strapped United Nations, already finding it hard to sustain its humanitarian work in Sudan, may not have the funds to mount a really credible inquiry. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF following an 18-month siege. It was the last city in Darfur held by the army and its allies. The RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arab groups in the city and elsewhere in Darfur - a claim it has denied. One gruesome feature of this conflict has been the huge volume of footage and photos of horrific atrocities - often seemingly filmed by the culprits themselves, and circulated online. Researchers say this digital evidence will be analysed in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""The people of Sudan, particularly now in el-Fasher, are facing a situation that I never saw before,"" says Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN's fact-finding mission on Sudan who has seen the change first-hand over more than two decades. The scale of the suffering today in Darfur is greater than the Janjaweed militia's genocide in the same region 20 years ago, she told the BBC's Newsday programme. The RSF traces its origins back to the Janjaweed. Back then, Ms Rishmawi explained, attacks were mainly on villages but now paramilitaries are targeting whole cities and refugees camps housing hundreds of thousands of people. ""[There have been] devastating mass killings, rape and torture, disappearances, missing people - and this comes against the background of 18 months of siege and starvation,"" she said. A joint G7 statement earlier this week condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered ""the world's largest humanitarian crisis"".

It follows the Trump administration's most vocal intervention to date in the Sudan civil war, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 summit demanding international action to halt the supply of weapons to the RSF paramilitaries - plus strongly worded criticism for some nations. The US is one of the so-called ""Quad"" of countries working for an end to the crisis, together with the UAE, along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia who are allies of Sudan's military-led government. The bloc recently proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. Rubio, in what was widely regarded as a reference to the UAE alleged backing of Sudan's rebels, said on Wednesday: ""We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved."" The UAE, which has long denied supporting the RSF, replied in a statement on Thursday saying it was alarmed by ""the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in el-Fasher"" and accused the Sudanese army of ""starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons"". These are accusation the Sudanese army has previously rejected. A furious denial also came from the RSF, denouncing what it called ""all biased statements against them"" and attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee el-Fasher, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth are visible from space in satellite imagery. Speaking on Friday, Türk said: ""There has been too much pretence and performance, and too little action"" from the international community in the face of Sudan's devastating civil war. ""It must stand up against these atrocities - a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population.""

The flow of weapons into Sudan during this war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - according to a leaked report by UN experts. The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF ""isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it"". He also said he did not want to ""diminish"" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying ""that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side"", meaning to the Sudanese army. All parties deny these allegations. A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to ""end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF"", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: ""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously."" There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups.

Activision Actress Kiernan Shipka takes a central role in Black Ops 7's campaign

There are some things you can always rely on, and a new Call of Duty game coming out each year is one of them. As one of the best-known names in video games, it's a series that needs little introduction. According to publisher Activision, it's sold an estimated 500 million copies, a movie adaptation is on the way, and despite having launched in 2003 it still reliably appears at - or near - the top of the annual bestseller charts. But this year the world's top military shooter might have a fight on its hands. Battlefield 6, which has been a huge hit for rival gaming giant Electronic Arts, has been drawing attention away from its veteran competitor. And long-time Call of Duty fans have been increasingly vocal over worries about the series losing touch with its roots.

The clash of the multiplayer titans comes at an interesting time for the makers of Call of Duty, who've had to issue responses to fan concerns about the series losing its way. It has long offered players the chance to purchase ""operator skins"" that change their character's appearance. They're a frequent source of brand crossovers, and previous designs have been based on stars including footballer Neymar Jr, streamer NickMercs and rapper Nicki Minaj. But when Activision revealed skins based on 90s cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead earlier this year, there was a backlash. Fans accused the company of trying to mimic Fortnite, the ever-popular multiplayer game famous for its sometimes unlikely crossovers, which have included pop star Sabrina Carpenter and an AI-voiced Darth Vader in 2025. Activision said the feedback from fans ""hit home"" and that it took the complaints about the series losing its identity seriously. It's also being released after parent company Microsoft increased prices of its Game Pass subscription service by 20%, angering many players.

Activision Black Ops games thrust players into a world of espionage and conspiracy

When BBC News sits down with lead producer Natalie Pohorski and senior comms director Stephanie Snowdon, they're keen to talk up Black Ops 7's single-player story campaign. The equivalent mode in Battlefield 6 was considered underwhelming by reviewers, and Call of Duty teams are renowned for their skill in crafting explosive set pieces in their narrative modes. Black Ops-themed installments of the series usually tell Hollywood blockbuster-style stories of secret agents uncovering vast conspiracies. Black Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2012's Black Ops 2, set in 2035 and tells a story involving a global terrorist threat and a murky big tech company. Natalie says that the ""Black Ops identity"" allows the developers to explore themes that others can't. ""There's a lot of really interesting and timeless ideas... there's endless ways to explore them,"" she says. ""And then we ask a lot of questions that could apply to any era - questions of trust, can you believe what you're seeing?""

Activision Milo Ventimiglia takes over the role of hero David Mason

Being one of the biggest names in gaming also allows Activision to attract some big-name talent to Call of Duty projects. For Black Ops 7, that includes Kiernan Shipka, best known for her role in Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia. Kiernan tells BBC News she's aware of Call of Duty's huge profile, and the expectations of its fans. She says being involved was ""honestly more exciting than anything."" ""I love a fandom,"" she says. ""And I think that when something over time garners such passion from fans, that means you're stepping into something really cool. ""The reaction is going to be what the reaction is going to be. ""If I let that stuff in, that's not a good thing."" As someone who played Call of Duty when he was younger, Milo says he's also aware of the standards fans have. ""I mean, I hope I don't muck it up for anybody,"" he says. Asked whether he thinks players are getting ""fatigued"" with the annual series, he says Black Ops 7 won't disappoint. ""I think this one just blows the others out of the water completely in the storytelling and where we go,"" he says.

But Call of Duty's campaigns, no matter how well-crafted or explosive they are, aren't the main reason players turn up for the series each year. The game owes its long-running success to the popularity of its multiplayer modes, and the performance of Black Ops 7 will be judged on whether they succeed. When they're asked if Battlefield's impressive player numbers affect their approach to development, Natalie and Stephanie insist they're only focused on making Black Ops 7 ""the best game it can be"". As for what it offers that Battlefield can't, Stephanie says, without directly comparing the two, that Call of Duty has ""variety and volume"" of experiences to offer. ""But more broadly, she says, ""I see games as a way for people to connect, to have fun. ""They are certainly responsible for some awesome relationships in my life. ""I hope that people continue to forge those connections and bonds and relationships and there's just more of us playing games together in however many years from now.""",2025-11-14T17:32:44.442287

PA Media The former Conservative leadership candidate gave evidence in court

A man has been found guilty of stalking former Conservative leadership candidate Dame Penny Mordaunt. However, Edward Brandt, 61, of Lymington, Hampshire, was cleared of the more serious charge of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. The jury at Southampton Crown Court heard he sent multiple emails and phone messages to Dame Penny and also turned up at her Portsmouth office out-of-hours in a bid to meet her. Dame Penny, who was an MP from 2010 to 2024, said in a statement to police that she ""feared sexual violence"" because of the defendant's ""creepy"" behaviour, the court heard.

The alleged offending occurred between 11 September 2023 and 12 May 2024. Brandt, a former councillor, was arrested in March last year and given a conditional caution the following month, requiring him not to contact Dame Penny, but he then left two voicemail messages for her. In one of the messages, he said: ""I am going to go on gently knocking at your door in order to shake your hand, I am not giving up.""

PA Media Edward Brandt was found guilty at Southampton Crown Court

The jury returned the guilty verdict by a majority of 10 to two. Brandt wept and held his hands over his face after the verdicts were returned. Explaining why he wanted to meet Dame Penny, the former elected member of East Hampshire District Council said he wanted to commiserate with her over her leadership bid. He added: ""I wanted to congratulate her because she was a reforming leader of the Commons, I wanted to congratulate her on the coronation, chat to her about her time in office, have her sign a copy of her book. ""It was entirely political and entirely harmless."" Clearly emotional at times, Dame Penny told the court: ""The difference between this case and even threats to shoot me and my family [is that] they are easier to deal with because that threat is not constantly present. ""It's not something you are having to think about every single day when you are leaving your house. ""I believe this man was a real threat to me and still is."" Brandt was released on conditional bail ahead of sentencing on 16 January.",2025-11-14T17:32:46.076337

Gift of the Givers About 23 of them have since left for other destinations, authorities say

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there will be an investigation into the ""mysterious"" arrival of a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza into the country. The group arrived at OR Tambo International Airport but were initially refused entry and were stuck in the plane for more than 10 hours as they ""did not have the customary departure stamps in their passports"", local authorities said. Most were eventually allowed in after intervention from a local charity and because of the government's ""empathy [and] compassion"", Ramaphosa said. The circumstances of their departure from Gaza and travel to South Africa remain unclear.

South Africa has maintained strong support for the Palestinian cause throughout the war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza. Ramaphosa said the group ""somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi"" and flew to South Africa, reports the News24 site. Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: ""The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them."" It did not specify the country. According to the Palestinian embassy in South Africa, the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, ""without any prior note or coordination"". A statement from the embassy said ""an unregistered and misleading organization [had] exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner"". The BBC has asked the Kenyan government for comment. Of the 153, 23 managed to fly on to other destinations, leaving 130 who were admitted into the country, South African authorities say. Ramaphosa, speaking during an event in Johannesburg, said he was informed of the unfolding crisis by the home affairs minister. In response, the president said ""we cannot turn them back"", according to News24. ""Even though they do not have the necessary documents and papers, these are people from a strife-torn, a war-torn country."" The president also told reporters the South African government would carry out a ""proper evaluation"" of the matter and update the public on ""what is happening and how this matter came to be where it is"", according to public broadcaster SABC.

Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said that while Palestinian passport-holders qualified for 90-day visa-exempt access to South Africa, the lack of departure stamps, return tickets or accommodation addresses in some of the travellers' documentation resulted in the initial refusal to let them into the country. Once it was established that the absence of this information ""did not indicate that the travellers wished to apply for asylum"" and their accommodation was confirmed, they were granted entry. ""All of the travellers are in possession of valid passports and, at present, none of them have applied for asylum,"" he said. South African charity Gift of the Givers has said it will provide the group with accommodation in the country. Civil societies in South Africa have called for investigations into the conditions the Palestinians had fled in Gaza and the exact route of the aircraft. One of the Palestinians who spoke to local eNCA TV expressed his relief to be in South Africa, describing it as a country of ""peace, laws and justice"". ""We came from Gaza where we've faced death on daily basis. We have survived a war of two years and we are lucky to be here,"" said one man who had fled with his wife and two children. Gift of the Givers has since called for Ramaphosa to investigate the home affairs ministry and border authority for the ""humiliation they've caused"" the Palestinians. The organisation's founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said this treatment included being forced to wait for hours on the tarmac at the airport, being denied food provided by the group and ""using every excuse in the book to prevent these passengers from disembarking"". South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. The country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause. Large pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began. Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it ""baseless"".

Surrey Police Thomas Waller was branded ""a very dangerous individual""

Warning: This story contains distressing details

A teenage nursery worker who raped and sexually abused children as young as three has been sentenced to 10 years in a young offender institution. Thomas Waller, now 18, was found guilty of multiple offences, including rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, earlier this year. Waller, who committed the offences in Surrey in 2024, was arrested after a mother was told by her son that he had been abused in a toilet while at nursery. At Guildford Crown Court, he was also sentenced to an additional five years on licence.

Within days of being able to look after children, Waller took advantage of his position to gain the trust of two boys in his care before exploiting them, the court heard. The teenager was working at a nursery for the summer months, where his responsibilities included taking children to the toilet and helping them get changed, the court was told. In a victim impact statement, one of the boys' fathers said his son had ""gathered a collection of memories that I would never wish on a human being"". ""Three things have kept us going; justice for our little boy; to protect other children from this dangerous, calculating predator; and to ensure that lessons are learnt for nurseries in Surrey and beyond that mean it is harder for paedophiles to abuse children,"" it added. Speaking about his son's new school, he added: ""We should be telling them that he doesn't like carrots, not that he has been raped."" Sentencing him, Judge Claire Harden-Frost said it was ""heartbreaking"" to see the boys' parents feeling responsible for what happened.

Teenage nursery worker convicted of child rape

The nursery, which cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ""We were, and remain, deeply shocked, saddened and sorry to learn of the actions of a former member of our staff. ""As soon as concerns were raised, we took immediate action, contacting the police without delay, suspending the individual concerned, and fully cooperating with the investigation."" It said a full review had been carried out and its safeguarding policies and staff training had been strengthened. Jonathan Hulley, Surrey County Council cabinet member for children, family and lifelong learning, said he was ""appalled"" by the crimes committed by Waller. ""The wellbeing and safeguarding of children and young people is our absolute priority,"" he added. Waller was found guilty of rape, two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity and taking indecent photos after a trial at Staines Youth Court earlier this year. The offending happened at a nursery in Surrey between July and August 2024.

Met Police Larry Fraser stole the limited edition signed print of Girl with Balloon from Grove Gallery

A man has been sentenced to 13 months in prison after admitting stealing a Banksy print from a gallery in central London. Larry Fraser, 49, stole the limited edition signed print of Girl with Balloon from Grove Gallery on New Cavendish Street on 8 September to pay off a historic drug debt. The artwork had been part of an exhibition showcasing a £1.5 million collection of 13 Banksy pieces at the gallery. At Kingston Crown Court, judge Anne Brown told Fraser: ""This is a brazen and serious non-domestic burglary.""

Fraser was caught on CCTV waiting outside the gallery for about 10 minutes on 8 September last year, before repeatedly smashing the glass door with a heavy blunt object. When he got into the building at about 23:00 BST, he went straight to the numbered picture and was seen on security cameras a short time later, carrying the print across a road.

Met Police Fraser has been sentenced to 13 months in prison but may be eligible for immediate release due to time spent on curfew

The value of the print, which was returned without damage, was approximately £270,000, the court heard. Fraser, of Beckton, east London, pleaded guilty to one count of burglary and may be eligible for immediate release due to time spent on electronic curfew. A second man, James Love, 54, was cleared of stealing the print following a trial, after he was accused of being a getaway driver. The court heard Fraser put forward a basis of plea in which he said he owed money due to a drug debt he was struggling to settle and agreed to commit the offence ""under a degree of pressure and fear"". He said he did not know the burglary's target until the day of the theft and did not know its value. Judge Brown said: ""Whilst you did not know the precise value of the print, you obviously understood it to be very valuable.""

Met Police Fraser was filmed smashing into the gallery in Fitzrovia

The court heard Fraser had 18 previous convictions but the most recent was in 2002. Then he was jailed for robbery and unlawful wounding but he had been ""out of trouble"" since being freed from prison in 2008. Jeffrey Israel, defending, said Fraser, who lived with his mother as her principal carer, managed to ""break his cycle of drug addiction"" after his last prison sentence. He said it ""would take a bold advocate"" to suggest the value of the print had increased by what happened to it, but added: ""That is probably the reality.""",2025-11-14T17:32:50.788494

Australia also have uncertainty over who is going to bat in their top three.

Facebook Jon Ruben admitted 17 offences at Leicester Crown Court on Friday

A man who laced sweets with tranquilliser and gave them to children at a summer camp in Leicestershire has admitted sexual offences against two boys under 13. Jon Ruben was arrested after eight children and one adult fell ill at Stathern Lodge in July. The 76-year-old, from Ruddington in Nottinghamshire, pleaded guilty to a total of 17 charges when he appeared at Leicester Crown Court on Friday. However, he denied one of the sexual offences he was charged with, which was against a boy under 13.

Ruben was remanded in custody ahead of a further hearing on 28 November.

'Sweet game'

Mary Prior KC, prosecuting, outlined Ruben's offending to the court. She said his victims were under-privileged children who were staying at a summer camp which he ran. Ruben played a ""sweet game"" with the children, Mrs Prior KC said, in which he would go into the boys' rooms when they were getting ready for bed and ask them to eat sweets ""as quickly as they can"". She told the court Ruben had played this game with the boys ""for many years"", and children had previously fallen ill the following morning. She said Ruben had been able to explain this away as the children being ""overwrought by enjoyment"", until his stepson had concerns in July 2025. Mrs Prior KC added: ""This year his stepson had concerns about what was going on, for good reason. ""They decided to have a look in the defendant's belongings.""

The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), previously told the BBC it was investigating Leicestershire Police's handling of the incident.

They found videos on his devices in which he had recorded himself raping women who seemed incapacitated or unconscious. Xu, who was the director of a recruitment business that helped recent Chinese graduates secure employment in London, set up secret cameras at his flat in an air-freshener and in a speaker to allow him to film people showering, using the toilet and getting changed. He would supply alcohol, including a cocktail he dubbed the ""spring of life"" that contained a mixture of alcohol and Chinese herbal medicines. Police found he had made ""compilations"" from his voyeuristic activities, editing together recordings of him raping women who were incapacitated.

""Upon forensic examination of Xu's phone, officers uncovered deeply disturbing material,"" Acting Det Supt Lewis Sanderson said. ""The device contained videos and images taken from a point-of-view perspective, showing Xu raping and seriously sexually assaulting women who appear to be unconscious or heavily incapacitated."" The detective added: ""We believe he is one of the most prolific sex offenders of all time."" Prosecutor Catherine Farrelly KC told the court that the videos revealed sexual abuse of at least 11 additional unknown women, and said Xu had recorded ""what he was doing as some sort of token"". Xu was a ""bold and persistent sexual predator whose offending steadily became more and more serious"", the court was told.

One victim told the court: ""I don't think I will ever be the same person again. ""I am afraid that I will never be able to forget what that man did to me and how he stole the person I was. ""I fear that I may have introduced Xu to other women who may have suffered the same fate as me. I carry that too. ""I felt out of control and so very alone. I have been told that the drugs he used on me are for animals."" She described how despite being drugged she was still conscious and knew what was happening to her.

""The terrifying thing had been that I couldn't open my eyes and mouth,"" she said. ""Nor could I move my body. I felt everything that he did, pulling my dress off and touching me intimately. I was horrified. ""I could just see through my eyes every now and then that he had his phone out. I just couldn't understand why he was doing that to me. ""He was supposed to be a friend.""

'Most appalling'

Xu was apprehended following a social event at his residence in Glashier Street, Greenwich, in May, when he raped a guest who was later found to have the drug GHB and the muscle relaxant scopolamine in her system. After the woman regained consciousness, she recalled parts of the attack, including Xu filming on his mobile phone. She and another woman reported him and he was arrested on 1 June.",2025-11-14T17:32:56.187872

AFP via Getty Images It is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, say aid groups and the G7

The UN human rights council has given unanimous backing to a fresh, independent investigation into mass killings reported in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher. ""Our wake-up calls were not heeded. Bloodstains on the ground in el-Fasher have been photographed from space. The stain on the record of the international community is less visible, but no less damaging,"" UN human rights chief Volker Türk said at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Friday. Since the civil war began over two years ago, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have been forced from their homes. The new investigation is mandated to identify those who ordered and carried out the massacre in el-Fasher.

The findings could be shared with the International Criminal Court. While Türk did warn individuals and companies ""fuelling and profiting"" from Sudan's war, there is disappointment that the mandate makes no mention of other countries sponsoring the conflict. The UAE is accused of shipping weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group, while Iran has been accused of supplying some weapons to the Sudanese army. Plus, there is concern that the cash-strapped United Nations, already finding it hard to sustain its humanitarian work in Sudan, may not have the funds to mount a really credible inquiry. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF following an 18-month siege. It was the last city in Darfur held by the army and its allies. The RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arab groups in the city and elsewhere in Darfur - a claim it has denied. One gruesome feature of this conflict has been the huge volume of footage and photos of horrific atrocities - often seemingly filmed by the culprits themselves, and circulated online. Researchers say this digital evidence will be analysed in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""The people of Sudan, particularly now in el-Fasher, are facing a situation that I never saw before,"" says Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN's fact-finding mission on Sudan who has seen the change first-hand over more than two decades. The scale of the suffering today in Darfur is greater than the Janjaweed militia's genocide in the same region 20 years ago, she told the BBC's Newsday programme. The RSF traces its origins back to the Janjaweed. Back then, Ms Rishmawi explained, attacks were mainly on villages but now paramilitaries are targeting whole cities and refugees camps housing hundreds of thousands of people. ""[There have been] devastating mass killings, rape and torture, disappearances, missing people - and this comes against the background of 18 months of siege and starvation,"" she said. A joint G7 statement earlier this week condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered ""the world's largest humanitarian crisis"".

It follows the Trump administration's most vocal intervention to date in the Sudan civil war, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 summit demanding international action to halt the supply of weapons to the RSF paramilitaries - plus strongly worded criticism for some nations. The US is one of the so-called ""Quad"" of countries working for an end to the crisis, together with the UAE, along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia who are allies of Sudan's military-led government. The bloc recently proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. Rubio, in what was widely regarded as a reference to the UAE alleged backing of Sudan's rebels, said on Wednesday: ""We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved."" The UAE, which has long denied supporting the RSF, replied in a statement on Thursday saying it was alarmed by ""the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in el-Fasher"" and accused the Sudanese army of ""starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons"". These are accusation the Sudanese army has previously rejected. A furious denial also came from the RSF, denouncing what it called ""all biased statements against them"" and attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee el-Fasher, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth are visible from space in satellite imagery. Speaking on Friday, Türk said: ""There has been too much pretence and performance, and too little action"" from the international community in the face of Sudan's devastating civil war. ""It must stand up against these atrocities - a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population.""

The flow of weapons into Sudan during this war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - according to a leaked report by UN experts. The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF ""isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it"". He also said he did not want to ""diminish"" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying ""that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side"", meaning to the Sudanese army. All parties deny these allegations. A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to ""end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF"", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: ""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously."" There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups.

Activision Actress Kiernan Shipka takes a central role in Black Ops 7's campaign

There are some things you can always rely on, and a new Call of Duty game coming out each year is one of them. As one of the best-known names in video games, it's a series that needs little introduction. According to publisher Activision, it's sold an estimated 500 million copies, a movie adaptation is on the way, and despite having launched in 2003 it still reliably appears at - or near - the top of the annual bestseller charts. But this year the world's top military shooter might have a fight on its hands. Battlefield 6, which has been a huge hit for rival gaming giant Electronic Arts, has been drawing attention away from its veteran competitor. And long-time Call of Duty fans have been increasingly vocal over worries about the series losing touch with its roots.

The clash of the multiplayer titans comes at an interesting time for the makers of Call of Duty, who've had to issue responses to fan concerns about the series losing its way. It has long offered players the chance to purchase ""operator skins"" that change their character's appearance. They're a frequent source of brand crossovers, and previous designs have been based on stars including footballer Neymar Jr, streamer NickMercs and rapper Nicki Minaj. But when Activision revealed skins based on 90s cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead earlier this year, there was a backlash. Fans accused the company of trying to mimic Fortnite, the ever-popular multiplayer game famous for its sometimes unlikely crossovers, which have included pop star Sabrina Carpenter and an AI-voiced Darth Vader in 2025. Activision said the feedback from fans ""hit home"" and that it took the complaints about the series losing its identity seriously. It's also being released after parent company Microsoft increased prices of its Game Pass subscription service by 20%, angering many players.

Activision Black Ops games thrust players into a world of espionage and conspiracy

When BBC News sits down with lead producer Natalie Pohorski and senior comms director Stephanie Snowdon, they're keen to talk up Black Ops 7's single-player story campaign. The equivalent mode in Battlefield 6 was considered underwhelming by reviewers, and Call of Duty teams are renowned for their skill in crafting explosive set pieces in their narrative modes. Black Ops-themed installments of the series usually tell Hollywood blockbuster-style stories of secret agents uncovering vast conspiracies. Black Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2012's Black Ops 2, set in 2035 and tells a story involving a global terrorist threat and a murky big tech company. Natalie says that the ""Black Ops identity"" allows the developers to explore themes that others can't. ""There's a lot of really interesting and timeless ideas... there's endless ways to explore them,"" she says. ""And then we ask a lot of questions that could apply to any era - questions of trust, can you believe what you're seeing?""

Activision Milo Ventimiglia takes over the role of hero David Mason

Being one of the biggest names in gaming also allows Activision to attract some big-name talent to Call of Duty projects. For Black Ops 7, that includes Kiernan Shipka, best known for her role in Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia. Kiernan tells BBC News she's aware of Call of Duty's huge profile, and the expectations of its fans. She says being involved was ""honestly more exciting than anything."" ""I love a fandom,"" she says. ""And I think that when something over time garners such passion from fans, that means you're stepping into something really cool. ""The reaction is going to be what the reaction is going to be. ""If I let that stuff in, that's not a good thing."" As someone who played Call of Duty when he was younger, Milo says he's also aware of the standards fans have. ""I mean, I hope I don't muck it up for anybody,"" he says. Asked whether he thinks players are getting ""fatigued"" with the annual series, he says Black Ops 7 won't disappoint. ""I think this one just blows the others out of the water completely in the storytelling and where we go,"" he says.

But Call of Duty's campaigns, no matter how well-crafted or explosive they are, aren't the main reason players turn up for the series each year. The game owes its long-running success to the popularity of its multiplayer modes, and the performance of Black Ops 7 will be judged on whether they succeed. When they're asked if Battlefield's impressive player numbers affect their approach to development, Natalie and Stephanie insist they're only focused on making Black Ops 7 ""the best game it can be"". As for what it offers that Battlefield can't, Stephanie says, without directly comparing the two, that Call of Duty has ""variety and volume"" of experiences to offer. ""But more broadly, she says, ""I see games as a way for people to connect, to have fun. ""They are certainly responsible for some awesome relationships in my life. ""I hope that people continue to forge those connections and bonds and relationships and there's just more of us playing games together in however many years from now.""",2025-11-14T17:32:59.802995

PA Media The former Conservative leadership candidate gave evidence in court

A man has been found guilty of stalking former Conservative leadership candidate Dame Penny Mordaunt. However, Edward Brandt, 61, of Lymington, Hampshire, was cleared of the more serious charge of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. The jury at Southampton Crown Court heard he sent multiple emails and phone messages to Dame Penny and also turned up at her Portsmouth office out-of-hours in a bid to meet her. Dame Penny, who was an MP from 2010 to 2024, said in a statement to police that she ""feared sexual violence"" because of the defendant's ""creepy"" behaviour, the court heard.

The alleged offending occurred between 11 September 2023 and 12 May 2024. Brandt, a former councillor, was arrested in March last year and given a conditional caution the following month, requiring him not to contact Dame Penny, but he then left two voicemail messages for her. In one of the messages, he said: ""I am going to go on gently knocking at your door in order to shake your hand, I am not giving up.""

PA Media Edward Brandt was found guilty at Southampton Crown Court

The jury returned the guilty verdict by a majority of 10 to two. Brandt wept and held his hands over his face after the verdicts were returned. Explaining why he wanted to meet Dame Penny, the former elected member of East Hampshire District Council said he wanted to commiserate with her over her leadership bid. He added: ""I wanted to congratulate her because she was a reforming leader of the Commons, I wanted to congratulate her on the coronation, chat to her about her time in office, have her sign a copy of her book. ""It was entirely political and entirely harmless."" Clearly emotional at times, Dame Penny told the court: ""The difference between this case and even threats to shoot me and my family [is that] they are easier to deal with because that threat is not constantly present. ""It's not something you are having to think about every single day when you are leaving your house. ""I believe this man was a real threat to me and still is."" Brandt was released on conditional bail ahead of sentencing on 16 January.",2025-11-14T17:33:01.512395

Gift of the Givers About 23 of them have since left for other destinations, authorities say

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there will be an investigation into the ""mysterious"" arrival of a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza into the country. The group arrived at OR Tambo International Airport but were initially refused entry and were stuck in the plane for more than 10 hours as they ""did not have the customary departure stamps in their passports"", local authorities said. Most were eventually allowed in after intervention from a local charity and because of the government's ""empathy [and] compassion"", Ramaphosa said. The circumstances of their departure from Gaza and travel to South Africa remain unclear.

South Africa has maintained strong support for the Palestinian cause throughout the war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza. Ramaphosa said the group ""somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi"" and flew to South Africa, reports the News24 site. Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: ""The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them."" It did not specify the country. According to the Palestinian embassy in South Africa, the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, ""without any prior note or coordination"". A statement from the embassy said ""an unregistered and misleading organization [had] exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner"". The BBC has asked the Kenyan government for comment. Of the 153, 23 managed to fly on to other destinations, leaving 130 who were admitted into the country, South African authorities say. Ramaphosa, speaking during an event in Johannesburg, said he was informed of the unfolding crisis by the home affairs minister. In response, the president said ""we cannot turn them back"", according to News24. ""Even though they do not have the necessary documents and papers, these are people from a strife-torn, a war-torn country."" The president also told reporters the South African government would carry out a ""proper evaluation"" of the matter and update the public on ""what is happening and how this matter came to be where it is"", according to public broadcaster SABC.

Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said that while Palestinian passport-holders qualified for 90-day visa-exempt access to South Africa, the lack of departure stamps, return tickets or accommodation addresses in some of the travellers' documentation resulted in the initial refusal to let them into the country. Once it was established that the absence of this information ""did not indicate that the travellers wished to apply for asylum"" and their accommodation was confirmed, they were granted entry. ""All of the travellers are in possession of valid passports and, at present, none of them have applied for asylum,"" he said. South African charity Gift of the Givers has said it will provide the group with accommodation in the country. Civil societies in South Africa have called for investigations into the conditions the Palestinians had fled in Gaza and the exact route of the aircraft. One of the Palestinians who spoke to local eNCA TV expressed his relief to be in South Africa, describing it as a country of ""peace, laws and justice"". ""We came from Gaza where we've faced death on daily basis. We have survived a war of two years and we are lucky to be here,"" said one man who had fled with his wife and two children. Gift of the Givers has since called for Ramaphosa to investigate the home affairs ministry and border authority for the ""humiliation they've caused"" the Palestinians. The organisation's founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said this treatment included being forced to wait for hours on the tarmac at the airport, being denied food provided by the group and ""using every excuse in the book to prevent these passengers from disembarking"". South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. The country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause. Large pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began. Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it ""baseless"".

Surrey Police Thomas Waller was branded ""a very dangerous individual""

Warning: This story contains distressing details

A teenage nursery worker who raped and sexually abused children as young as three has been sentenced to 10 years in a young offender institution. Thomas Waller, now 18, was found guilty of multiple offences, including rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, earlier this year. Waller, who committed the offences in Surrey in 2024, was arrested after a mother was told by her son that he had been abused in a toilet while at nursery. At Guildford Crown Court, he was also sentenced to an additional five years on licence.

Within days of being able to look after children, Waller took advantage of his position to gain the trust of two boys in his care before exploiting them, the court heard. The teenager was working at a nursery for the summer months, where his responsibilities included taking children to the toilet and helping them get changed, the court was told. In a victim impact statement, one of the boys' fathers said his son had ""gathered a collection of memories that I would never wish on a human being"". ""Three things have kept us going; justice for our little boy; to protect other children from this dangerous, calculating predator; and to ensure that lessons are learnt for nurseries in Surrey and beyond that mean it is harder for paedophiles to abuse children,"" it added. Speaking about his son's new school, he added: ""We should be telling them that he doesn't like carrots, not that he has been raped."" Sentencing him, Judge Claire Harden-Frost said it was ""heartbreaking"" to see the boys' parents feeling responsible for what happened.

Teenage nursery worker convicted of child rape

The nursery, which cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ""We were, and remain, deeply shocked, saddened and sorry to learn of the actions of a former member of our staff. ""As soon as concerns were raised, we took immediate action, contacting the police without delay, suspending the individual concerned, and fully cooperating with the investigation."" It said a full review had been carried out and its safeguarding policies and staff training had been strengthened. Jonathan Hulley, Surrey County Council cabinet member for children, family and lifelong learning, said he was ""appalled"" by the crimes committed by Waller. ""The wellbeing and safeguarding of children and young people is our absolute priority,"" he added. Waller was found guilty of rape, two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity and taking indecent photos after a trial at Staines Youth Court earlier this year. The offending happened at a nursery in Surrey between July and August 2024.

Met Police Larry Fraser stole the limited edition signed print of Girl with Balloon from Grove Gallery

A man has been sentenced to 13 months in prison after admitting stealing a Banksy print from a gallery in central London. Larry Fraser, 49, stole the limited edition signed print of Girl with Balloon from Grove Gallery on New Cavendish Street on 8 September to pay off a historic drug debt. The artwork had been part of an exhibition showcasing a £1.5 million collection of 13 Banksy pieces at the gallery. At Kingston Crown Court, judge Anne Brown told Fraser: ""This is a brazen and serious non-domestic burglary.""

PA Media The print was returned to the Grove Gallery exhibition undamaged after it was recovered by police

Fraser was caught on CCTV waiting outside the gallery for about 10 minutes on 8 September last year, before repeatedly smashing the glass door with a heavy blunt object. When he got into the building at about 23:00 BST, he went straight to the numbered picture and was seen on security cameras a short time later, carrying the print across a road.

Met Police Fraser has been sentenced to 13 months in prison but may be eligible for immediate release due to time spent on curfew

The value of the print, which was returned without damage, was approximately £270,000, the court heard. Fraser, of Beckton, east London, pleaded guilty to one count of burglary and may be eligible for immediate release due to time spent on electronic curfew. A second man, James Love, 54, was cleared of stealing the print following a trial, after he was accused of being a getaway driver. The court heard Fraser put forward a basis of plea in which he said he owed money due to a drug debt he was struggling to settle and agreed to commit the offence ""under a degree of pressure and fear"". He said he did not know the burglary's target until the day of the theft and did not know its value. Judge Brown said: ""Whilst you did not know the precise value of the print, you obviously understood it to be very valuable.""

The court heard Fraser had 18 previous convictions but the most recent was in 2002. Then he was jailed for robbery and unlawful wounding but he had been ""out of trouble"" since being freed from prison in 2008. Jeffrey Israel, defending, said Fraser, who lived with his mother as her principal carer, managed to ""break his cycle of drug addiction"" after his last prison sentence. He said it ""would take a bold advocate"" to suggest the value of the print had increased by what happened to it, but added: ""That is probably the reality.""",2025-11-14T17:33:06.448837

Australia also have uncertainty over who is going to bat in their top three.

Usman Khawaja is set to open, but the hosts must decide between giving a debut to opener Jake Weatherald, recalling the in-form Marnus Labuschagne as either an opener or at number three and whether to stick with all-rounder Cameron Green at three or move him down the order.

Anderson said those issues, compared to how consistent Australia's team selection has been in the last 10 years, mean this is ""probably their weakest team"" since 2010-11.

However, England's all-time leading wicket-taker said there is still a lot of ""quality"" in Australia's batting and bowling - even with the ""huge"" absence of Cummins.

He said: ""They probably just edge out England in terms of being favourites, but I don't think there's much in it. It's a tough one to call, so I'd say Australia, just.""",2025-11-14T17:33:10.065310

""I had to battle a little more today,"" said McIlroy, who mixed six birdies and three bogeys in his second round display.

""I felt like I showed my scoring skills and stayed patient, and got the ball up and down when I needed to.

Facebook Jon Ruben admitted 17 offences at Leicester Crown Court on Friday

A man who laced sweets with tranquilliser and gave them to children at a summer camp in Leicestershire has admitted sexual offences against two boys under 13. Jon Ruben was arrested after eight children and one adult fell ill at Stathern Lodge in July. The 76-year-old, from Ruddington in Nottinghamshire, pleaded guilty to a total of 17 charges when he appeared at Leicester Crown Court on Friday. However, he denied one of the sexual offences he was charged with, which was against a boy under 13.

Ruben was remanded in custody ahead of a further hearing on 28 November.

'Sweet game'

Mary Prior KC, prosecuting, outlined Ruben's offending to the court. She said his victims were under-privileged children who were staying at a summer camp which he ran. Ruben played a ""sweet game"" with the children, Mrs Prior KC said, in which he would go into the boys' rooms when they were getting ready for bed and ask them to eat sweets ""as quickly as they can"". She told the court Ruben had played this game with the boys ""for many years"", and children had previously fallen ill the following morning. She said Ruben had been able to explain this away as the children being ""overwrought by enjoyment"", until his stepson had concerns in July 2025. Mrs Prior KC added: ""This year his stepson had concerns about what was going on, for good reason. ""They decided to have a look in the defendant's belongings.""

Mrs Prior KC said items including baby oil, Vaseline and syringes were found, and his stepson notified the police about his concerns. She said Ruben went on to play the ""sweet game"" with six boys that night - Saturday 26 July - and they were all ill the following morning. ""The police had not gone out by that stage,"" she added. The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), previously told the BBC it was investigating Leicestershire Police's handling of the incident. Mrs Prior said the children were having difficulty walking due to being ill, so Ruben's stepson called the police again. She said Ruben then played the ""sweet game"" in a room of five children.",2025-11-14T17:32:52.690266

Met Police Chao Xu is believed to have sexually assaulted more women and police are urging them to come forward

A serial rapist thought to be ""one of the most prolific sex offenders of all time"" who drugged, raped and secretly filmed his victims has been sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 14 years. Chao Xu, a Chinese national, pleaded guilty to 24 sexual offences, including sexual assault, voyeurism and upskirting against six women between November 2021 and June 2025. Sentencing Xu at Woolwich Crown Court, Judge Christopher Grout described him as a ""sexual predator"" and ""an incredibly dangerous man"". Police believe the total number of his victims is in the hundreds and have appealed for women who were abused by Xu to contact them.

'Spring of life'

The 33-year-old, who has lived in the UK since 2016 and is a graduate of the University of Greenwich, hosted networking events at his flat in south-east London, where he spiked drinks and raped some of the women who attended, detectives said. They found videos on his devices in which he had recorded himself raping women who seemed incapacitated or unconscious. Xu, who was the director of a recruitment business that helped recent Chinese graduates secure employment in London, set up secret cameras at his flat in an air-freshener and in a speaker to allow him to film people showering, using the toilet and getting changed. He would supply alcohol, including a cocktail he dubbed the ""spring of life"" that contained a mixture of alcohol and Chinese herbal medicines. Police found he had made ""compilations"" from his voyeuristic activities, editing together recordings of him raping women who were incapacitated.

""Upon forensic examination of Xu's phone, officers uncovered deeply disturbing material,"" Acting Det Supt Lewis Sanderson said. ""The device contained videos and images taken from a point-of-view perspective, showing Xu raping and seriously sexually assaulting women who appear to be unconscious or heavily incapacitated."" The detective added: ""We believe he is one of the most prolific sex offenders of all time."" Prosecutor Catherine Farrelly KC told the court that the videos revealed sexual abuse of at least 11 additional unknown women, and said Xu had recorded ""what he was doing as some sort of token"". Xu was a ""bold and persistent sexual predator whose offending steadily became more and more serious"", the court was told.

Met Police A picture Xu took of himself installing hidden camera

One victim told the court: ""I don't think I will ever be the same person again. ""I am afraid that I will never be able to forget what that man did to me and how he stole the person I was. ""I fear that I may have introduced Xu to other women who may have suffered the same fate as me. I carry that too. ""I felt out of control and so very alone. I have been told that the drugs he used on me are for animals."" She described how despite being drugged she was still conscious and knew what was happening to her.

""The terrifying thing had been that I couldn't open my eyes and mouth,"" she said. ""Nor could I move my body. I felt everything that he did, pulling my dress off and touching me intimately. I was horrified. ""I could just see through my eyes every now and then that he had his phone out. I just couldn't understand why he was doing that to me. ""He was supposed to be a friend.""

'Most appalling'

Xu was apprehended following a social event at his residence in Glashier Street, Greenwich, in May, when he raped a guest who was later found to have the drug GHB and the muscle relaxant scopolamine in her system. After the woman regained consciousness, she recalled parts of the attack, including Xu filming on his mobile phone.

AFP via Getty Images It is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, say aid groups and the G7

The UN human rights council has given unanimous backing to a fresh, independent investigation into mass killings reported in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher. ""Our wake-up calls were not heeded. Bloodstains on the ground in el-Fasher have been photographed from space. The stain on the record of the international community is less visible, but no less damaging,"" UN human rights chief Volker Türk said at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Friday. Since the civil war began over two years ago, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have been forced from their homes. The new investigation is mandated to identify those who ordered and carried out the massacre in el-Fasher.

The findings could be shared with the International Criminal Court. While Türk did warn individuals and companies ""fuelling and profiting"" from Sudan's war, there is disappointment that the mandate makes no mention of other countries sponsoring the conflict. The UAE is accused of shipping weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group, while Iran has been accused of supplying some weapons to the Sudanese army. Plus, there is concern that the cash-strapped United Nations, already finding it hard to sustain its humanitarian work in Sudan, may not have the funds to mount a really credible inquiry. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF following an 18-month siege. It was the last city in Darfur held by the army and its allies. The RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arab groups in the city and elsewhere in Darfur - a claim it has denied. One gruesome feature of this conflict has been the huge volume of footage and photos of horrific atrocities - often seemingly filmed by the culprits themselves, and circulated online. Researchers say this digital evidence will be analysed in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""The people of Sudan, particularly now in el-Fasher, are facing a situation that I never saw before,"" says Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN's fact-finding mission on Sudan who has seen the change first-hand over more than two decades. The scale of the suffering today in Darfur is greater than the Janjaweed militia's genocide in the same region 20 years ago, she told the BBC's Newsday programme. The RSF traces its origins back to the Janjaweed. Back then, Ms Rishmawi explained, attacks were mainly on villages but now paramilitaries are targeting whole cities and refugees camps housing hundreds of thousands of people. ""[There have been] devastating mass killings, rape and torture, disappearances, missing people - and this comes against the background of 18 months of siege and starvation,"" she said. A joint G7 statement earlier this week condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered ""the world's largest humanitarian crisis"".

It follows the Trump administration's most vocal intervention to date in the Sudan civil war, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 summit demanding international action to halt the supply of weapons to the RSF paramilitaries - plus strongly worded criticism for some nations. The US is one of the so-called ""Quad"" of countries working for an end to the crisis, together with the UAE, along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia who are allies of Sudan's military-led government. The bloc recently proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. Rubio, in what was widely regarded as a reference to the UAE alleged backing of Sudan's rebels, said on Wednesday: ""We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved."" The UAE, which has long denied supporting the RSF, replied in a statement on Thursday saying it was alarmed by ""the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in el-Fasher"" and accused the Sudanese army of ""starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons"". These are accusation the Sudanese army has previously rejected. A furious denial also came from the RSF, denouncing what it called ""all biased statements against them"" and attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee el-Fasher, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth are visible from space in satellite imagery. Speaking on Friday, Türk said: ""There has been too much pretence and performance, and too little action"" from the international community in the face of Sudan's devastating civil war. ""It must stand up against these atrocities - a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population.""

The flow of weapons into Sudan during this war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - according to a leaked report by UN experts. The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF ""isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it"". He also said he did not want to ""diminish"" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying ""that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side"", meaning to the Sudanese army. All parties deny these allegations. A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to ""end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF"", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: ""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously."" There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups.

Activision Actress Kiernan Shipka takes a central role in Black Ops 7's campaign

There are some things you can always rely on, and a new Call of Duty game coming out each year is one of them. As one of the best-known names in video games, it's a series that needs little introduction. According to publisher Activision, it's sold an estimated 500 million copies, a movie adaptation is on the way, and despite having launched in 2003 it still reliably appears at - or near - the top of the annual bestseller charts. But this year the world's top military shooter might have a fight on its hands. Battlefield 6, which has been a huge hit for rival gaming giant Electronic Arts, has been drawing attention away from its veteran competitor. And long-time Call of Duty fans have been increasingly vocal over worries about the series losing touch with its roots.

The clash of the multiplayer titans comes at an interesting time for the makers of Call of Duty, who've had to issue responses to fan concerns about the series losing its way. It has long offered players the chance to purchase ""operator skins"" that change their character's appearance. They're a frequent source of brand crossovers, and previous designs have been based on stars including footballer Neymar Jr, streamer NickMercs and rapper Nicki Minaj. But when Activision revealed skins based on 90s cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead earlier this year, there was a backlash. Fans accused the company of trying to mimic Fortnite, the ever-popular multiplayer game famous for its sometimes unlikely crossovers, which have included pop star Sabrina Carpenter and an AI-voiced Darth Vader in 2025. Activision said the feedback from fans ""hit home"" and that it took the complaints about the series losing its identity seriously. It's also being released after parent company Microsoft increased prices of its Game Pass subscription service by 20%, angering many players.

Activision Black Ops games thrust players into a world of espionage and conspiracy

When BBC News sits down with lead producer Natalie Pohorski and senior comms director Stephanie Snowdon, they're keen to talk up Black Ops 7's single-player story campaign. The equivalent mode in Battlefield 6 was considered underwhelming by reviewers, and Call of Duty teams are renowned for their skill in crafting explosive set pieces in their narrative modes. Black Ops-themed installments of the series usually tell Hollywood blockbuster-style stories of secret agents uncovering vast conspiracies. Black Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2012's Black Ops 2, set in 2035 and tells a story involving a global terrorist threat and a murky big tech company. Natalie says that the ""Black Ops identity"" allows the developers to explore themes that others can't. ""There's a lot of really interesting and timeless ideas... there's endless ways to explore them,"" she says. ""And then we ask a lot of questions that could apply to any era - questions of trust, can you believe what you're seeing?""

Activision Milo Ventimiglia takes over the role of hero David Mason

Being one of the biggest names in gaming also allows Activision to attract some big-name talent to Call of Duty projects. For Black Ops 7, that includes Kiernan Shipka, best known for her role in Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia. Kiernan tells BBC News she's aware of Call of Duty's huge profile, and the expectations of its fans. She says being involved was ""honestly more exciting than anything."" ""I love a fandom,"" she says. ""And I think that when something over time garners such passion from fans, that means you're stepping into something really cool. ""The reaction is going to be what the reaction is going to be. ""If I let that stuff in, that's not a good thing."" As someone who played Call of Duty when he was younger, Milo says he's also aware of the standards fans have. ""I mean, I hope I don't muck it up for anybody,"" he says. Asked whether he thinks players are getting ""fatigued"" with the annual series, he says Black Ops 7 won't disappoint. ""I think this one just blows the others out of the water completely in the storytelling and where we go,"" he says.

But Call of Duty's campaigns, no matter how well-crafted or explosive they are, aren't the main reason players turn up for the series each year. The game owes its long-running success to the popularity of its multiplayer modes, and the performance of Black Ops 7 will be judged on whether they succeed. When they're asked if Battlefield's impressive player numbers affect their approach to development, Natalie and Stephanie insist they're only focused on making Black Ops 7 ""the best game it can be"". As for what it offers that Battlefield can't, Stephanie says, without directly comparing the two, that Call of Duty has ""variety and volume"" of experiences to offer. ""But more broadly, she says, ""I see games as a way for people to connect, to have fun. ""They are certainly responsible for some awesome relationships in my life. ""I hope that people continue to forge those connections and bonds and relationships and there's just more of us playing games together in however many years from now.""",2025-11-14T17:33:01.560311

PA Media The former Conservative leadership candidate gave evidence in court

A man has been found guilty of stalking former Conservative leadership candidate Dame Penny Mordaunt. However, Edward Brandt, 61, of Lymington, Hampshire, was cleared of the more serious charge of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. The jury at Southampton Crown Court heard he sent multiple emails and phone messages to Dame Penny and also turned up at her Portsmouth office out-of-hours in a bid to meet her. Dame Penny, who was an MP from 2010 to 2024, said in a statement to police that she ""feared sexual violence"" because of the defendant's ""creepy"" behaviour, the court heard.

The alleged offending occurred between 11 September 2023 and 12 May 2024. Brandt, a former councillor, was arrested in March last year and given a conditional caution the following month, requiring him not to contact Dame Penny, but he then left two voicemail messages for her. In one of the messages, he said: ""I am going to go on gently knocking at your door in order to shake your hand, I am not giving up.""

PA Media Edward Brandt was found guilty at Southampton Crown Court

The jury returned the guilty verdict by a majority of 10 to two. Brandt wept and held his hands over his face after the verdicts were returned. Explaining why he wanted to meet Dame Penny, the former elected member of East Hampshire District Council said he wanted to commiserate with her over her leadership bid. He added: ""I wanted to congratulate her because she was a reforming leader of the Commons, I wanted to congratulate her on the coronation, chat to her about her time in office, have her sign a copy of her book. ""It was entirely political and entirely harmless."" Clearly emotional at times, Dame Penny told the court: ""The difference between this case and even threats to shoot me and my family [is that] they are easier to deal with because that threat is not constantly present. ""It's not something you are having to think about every single day when you are leaving your house. ""I believe this man was a real threat to me and still is.""

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there will be an investigation into the ""mysterious"" arrival of a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza into the country. The group arrived at OR Tambo International Airport but were initially refused entry and were stuck in the plane for more than 10 hours as they ""did not have the customary departure stamps in their passports"", local authorities said. Most were eventually allowed in after intervention from a local charity and because of the government's ""empathy [and] compassion"", Ramaphosa said. The circumstances of their departure from Gaza and travel to South Africa remain unclear.

South Africa has maintained strong support for the Palestinian cause throughout the war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza. Ramaphosa said the group ""somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi"" and flew to South Africa, reports the News24 site. Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: ""The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them."" It did not specify the country. According to the Palestinian embassy in South Africa, the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, ""without any prior note or coordination"". A statement from the embassy said ""an unregistered and misleading organization [had] exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner"". The BBC has asked the Kenyan government for comment. Of the 153, 23 managed to fly on to other destinations, leaving 130 who were admitted into the country, South African authorities say. Ramaphosa, speaking during an event in Johannesburg, said he was informed of the unfolding crisis by the home affairs minister. In response, the president said ""we cannot turn them back"", according to News24. ""Even though they do not have the necessary documents and papers, these are people from a strife-torn, a war-torn country."" The president also told reporters the South African government would carry out a ""proper evaluation"" of the matter and update the public on ""what is happening and how this matter came to be where it is"", according to public broadcaster SABC.

Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said that while Palestinian passport-holders qualified for 90-day visa-exempt access to South Africa, the lack of departure stamps, return tickets or accommodation addresses in some of the travellers' documentation resulted in the initial refusal to let them into the country. Once it was established that the absence of this information ""did not indicate that the travellers wished to apply for asylum"" and their accommodation was confirmed, they were granted entry. ""All of the travellers are in possession of valid passports and, at present, none of them have applied for asylum,"" he said. South African charity Gift of the Givers has said it will provide the group with accommodation in the country. Civil societies in South Africa have called for investigations into the conditions the Palestinians had fled in Gaza and the exact route of the aircraft. One of the Palestinians who spoke to local eNCA TV expressed his relief to be in South Africa, describing it as a country of ""peace, laws and justice"". ""We came from Gaza where we've faced death on daily basis. We have survived a war of two years and we are lucky to be here,"" said one man who had fled with his wife and two children. Gift of the Givers has since called for Ramaphosa to investigate the home affairs ministry and border authority for the ""humiliation they've caused"" the Palestinians. The organisation's founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said this treatment included being forced to wait for hours on the tarmac at the airport, being denied food provided by the group and ""using every excuse in the book to prevent these passengers from disembarking"". South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. The country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause. Large pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began. Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it ""baseless"".

Surrey Police Thomas Waller was branded ""a very dangerous individual""

Warning: This story contains distressing details

A teenage nursery worker who raped and sexually abused children as young as three has been sentenced to 10 years in a young offender institution. Thomas Waller, now 18, was found guilty of multiple offences, including rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, earlier this year. Waller, who committed the offences in Surrey in 2024, was arrested after a mother was told by her son that he had been abused in a toilet while at nursery. At Guildford Crown Court, he was also sentenced to an additional five years on licence.

Within days of being able to look after children, Waller took advantage of his position to gain the trust of two boys in his care before exploiting them, the court heard. The teenager was working at a nursery for the summer months, where his responsibilities included taking children to the toilet and helping them get changed, the court was told. In a victim impact statement, one of the boys' fathers said his son had ""gathered a collection of memories that I would never wish on a human being"". ""Three things have kept us going; justice for our little boy; to protect other children from this dangerous, calculating predator; and to ensure that lessons are learnt for nurseries in Surrey and beyond that mean it is harder for paedophiles to abuse children,"" it added. Speaking about his son's new school, he added: ""We should be telling them that he doesn't like carrots, not that he has been raped."" Sentencing him, Judge Claire Harden-Frost said it was ""heartbreaking"" to see the boys' parents feeling responsible for what happened.

Teenage nursery worker convicted of child rape

The nursery, which cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ""We were, and remain, deeply shocked, saddened and sorry to learn of the actions of a former member of our staff. ""As soon as concerns were raised, we took immediate action, contacting the police without delay, suspending the individual concerned, and fully cooperating with the investigation."" It said a full review had been carried out and its safeguarding policies and staff training had been strengthened. Jonathan Hulley, Surrey County Council cabinet member for children, family and lifelong learning, said he was ""appalled"" by the crimes committed by Waller. ""The wellbeing and safeguarding of children and young people is our absolute priority,"" he added. Waller was found guilty of rape, two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity and taking indecent photos after a trial at Staines Youth Court earlier this year. The offending happened at a nursery in Surrey between July and August 2024.

Met Police Larry Fraser stole the limited edition signed print of Girl with Balloon from Grove Gallery

A man has been sentenced to 13 months in prison after admitting stealing a Banksy print from a gallery in central London. Larry Fraser, 49, stole the limited edition signed print of Girl with Balloon from Grove Gallery on New Cavendish Street on 8 September to pay off a historic drug debt. The artwork had been part of an exhibition showcasing a £1.5 million collection of 13 Banksy pieces at the gallery. At Kingston Crown Court, judge Anne Brown told Fraser: ""This is a brazen and serious non-domestic burglary.""

PA Media The print was returned to the Grove Gallery exhibition undamaged after it was recovered by police

Fraser was caught on CCTV waiting outside the gallery for about 10 minutes on 8 September last year, before repeatedly smashing the glass door with a heavy blunt object. When he got into the building at about 23:00 BST, he went straight to the numbered picture and was seen on security cameras a short time later, carrying the print across a road.

Met Police Fraser has been sentenced to 13 months in prison but may be eligible for immediate release due to time spent on curfew

The value of the print, which was returned without damage, was approximately £270,000, the court heard. Fraser, of Beckton, east London, pleaded guilty to one count of burglary and may be eligible for immediate release due to time spent on electronic curfew. A second man, James Love, 54, was cleared of stealing the print following a trial, after he was accused of being a getaway driver. The court heard Fraser put forward a basis of plea in which he said he owed money due to a drug debt he was struggling to settle and agreed to commit the offence ""under a degree of pressure and fear"". He said he did not know the burglary's target until the day of the theft and did not know its value. Judge Brown said: ""Whilst you did not know the precise value of the print, you obviously understood it to be very valuable.""

The court heard Fraser had 18 previous convictions but the most recent was in 2002. Then he was jailed for robbery and unlawful wounding but he had been ""out of trouble"" since being freed from prison in 2008. Jeffrey Israel, defending, said Fraser, who lived with his mother as her principal carer, managed to ""break his cycle of drug addiction"" after his last prison sentence. He said it ""would take a bold advocate"" to suggest the value of the print had increased by what happened to it, but added: ""That is probably the reality.""",2025-11-14T17:33:08.521271

Australia also have uncertainty over who is going to bat in their top three.

Usman Khawaja is set to open, but the hosts must decide between giving a debut to opener Jake Weatherald, recalling the in-form Marnus Labuschagne as either an opener or at number three and whether to stick with all-rounder Cameron Green at three or move him down the order.

Anderson said those issues, compared to how consistent Australia's team selection has been in the last 10 years, mean this is ""probably their weakest team"" since 2010-11.

Rory McIlroy continued his charge for his seventh Race to Dubai title after a strong second round at the DP World Tour Championship.

The Northern Irishman hit a three-under 69 to sit in a five-man tie for second - alongside the likes of Ireland's Shane Lowry and England's Justin Rose - on nine under par.

The chasing pack are three strokes behind Denmark's Nicolai Hojgaard, who fired 65 on day two in the United Arab Emirates.

""I had to battle a little more today,"" said McIlroy, who mixed six birdies and three bogeys in his second round display.

""I felt like I showed my scoring skills and stayed patient, and got the ball up and down when I needed to.

""And overall, to shoot 69, I'm pretty pleased considering some of the spots that I found myself.""

The 36-year-old has a 767-point lead at the top of the season-long rankings for his fourth consecutive Race to Dubai title.

However, he denied one of the sexual offences he was charged with, which was against a nine-year-old boy.

The 76-year-old, from Ruddington in Nottinghamshire, pleaded guilty to a total of 17 charges when he appeared at Leicester Crown Court on Friday.

Jon Ruben was arrested after eight children and one adult fell ill at Stathern Lodge in July.

A man who laced sweets with tranquilliser and gave them to children at a summer camp in Leicestershire has admitted sexual offences against two boys, aged nine and 10.

Ruben was remanded in custody ahead of a further hearing on 28 November.

'Sweet game'

Mary Prior KC, prosecuting, outlined Ruben's offending to the court.

She said his victims were under-privileged children who were staying at a summer camp which he ran.

Ruben played a ""sweet game"" with the children, Mrs Prior said, in which he would go into the boys' rooms when they were getting ready for bed and ask them to eat sweets ""as quickly as they can"".

She told the court Ruben had played this game with the boys ""for many years"", and children had previously fallen ill the following morning.

She said Ruben had been able to explain this for many years as the children being ""overwrought by enjoyment"", until his stepson had concerns in July 2025.

Mrs Prior KC added: ""This year his stepson had concerns about what was going on, for good reason.

""They decided to have a look in the defendant's belongings.""

Mrs Prior KC said items including baby oil, Vaseline and syringes were found, and his stepson notified the police about his concerns.

She said Ruben went on to play the ""sweet game"" with six boys that night - Saturday 26 July - and they were all ill the following morning.

""The police had not gone out by that stage,"" she added.

The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), previously told the BBC it was investigating Leicestershire Police's handling of the incident.

Mrs Prior said the children were having difficulty walking due to being ill, so Ruben's stepson called the police again.

She said Ruben then played the ""sweet game"" in a room of five children.",2025-11-14T17:14:50.828816

Metropolitan Police Chao Xu is believed to have sexually assaulted more women and police are urging them to come forward

A serial rapist thought to be ""one of the most prolific sex offenders of all time"" who drugged, raped and secretly filmed his victims has been sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 14 years. Chao Xu, a Chinese national, pleaded guilty to 24 sexual offences, including sexual assault, voyeurism and upskirting against six women between November 2021 and June 2025. Sentencing Xu at Woolwich Crown Court, Judge Christopher Grout described him as a ""sexual predator"" and ""an incredibly dangerous man"". One of the women he targeted told the court that she would ""never be able to forget"" what Xu did to her. Police are appealing for any more of his victims to come forward.

Detectives believe Xu hosted networking events at his flat in south-east London where he spiked drinks and raped some of the women who attended. They found videos on his devices in which he had recorded himself raping women who seemed incapacitated or unconscious. He set up secret cameras in an air-freshener and in a speaker to film people showering, using the toilet and getting changed. Police found that he had made ""compilations"" from his voyeuristic activities, editing together recordings of him raping women who were incapacitated.

AFP via Getty Images It is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, say aid groups and the G7

An independent fact-finding mission will investigate reported mass killings in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher, the UN announced on Friday. ""There has been too much pretence and performance, and too little action"" from the international community in the face of Sudan's devastating civil war, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said at an emergency meeting in Geneva. ""It must stand up against these atrocities - a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population,"" he added, and gave a stark warning to all those ""fuelling and profiting"" from the civil war. More than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have had no choice but to flee their homes.

As part of the investigations, experts will also seek to identify perpetrators in order to hold them to account. El-Fasher was captured last month by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group following an 18-month siege. It was the last city in Darfur held by the army and its allies. The RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arab groups in the city and elsewhere in Darfur - a claim it has denied. One gruesome feature of this more than two-year-long civil conflict has been the huge volume of footage and photos of horrific atrocities - often seemingly filmed by the culprits themselves, and circulated online. Researchers say this digital evidence will be analysed in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""The people of Sudan, particularly now in el-Fasher, are facing a situation that I never saw before,"" says Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN's fact-finding mission on Sudan who has seen the change first-hand over more than two decades. The scale of the suffering today in Darfur is greater than the Janjaweed militia's genocide in the same region 20 years ago, she told the BBC's Newsday programme. The RSF traces its origins back to the Janjaweed. Back then, Ms Rishmawi explained, attacks were mainly on villages but now paramilitaries are targeting whole cities and refugees camps housing hundreds of thousands of people. ""[There have been] devastating mass killings, rape and torture, disappearances, missing people - and this comes against the background of 18 months of siege and starvation,"" she said. A joint G7 statement earlier this week condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered ""the world's largest humanitarian crisis"".

It follows the Trump administration's most vocal intervention to date in the Sudan civil war, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 summit demanding international action to halt the supply of weapons to the RSF paramilitaries - plus strongly worded criticism for some nations. The US is one of the so-called ""Quad"" of countries working for an end to the crisis, together with the UAE, along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia who are allies of Sudan's military-led government. The bloc recently proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. Rubio, in what was widely regarded as a reference to the UAE alleged backing of Sudan's rebels, said on Wednesday: ""We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved."" The UAE, which has long denied supporting the RSF, replied in a statement on Thursday saying it was alarmed by ""the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in el-Fasher"" and accused the Sudanese army of ""starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons"". These are accusation the Sudanese army has previously rejected. A furious denial also came from the RSF, denouncing what it called ""all biased statements against them"" and attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee el-Fasher, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth are visible from space in satellite imagery.

The flow of weapons into Sudan during this war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - according to a leaked report by UN experts. The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF ""isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it"". He also said he did not want to ""diminish"" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying ""that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side"", meaning to the Sudanese army. All parties deny these allegations. A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to ""end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF"", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: ""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously."" There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups.

There are some things you can always rely on, and a new Call of Duty game coming out each year is one of them. As one of the best-known names in video games, it's a series that needs little introduction. According to publisher Activision, it's sold an estimated 500 million copies, a movie adaptation is on the way, and despite having launched in 2003 it still reliably appears at - or near - the top of the annual bestseller charts. But this year the world's top military shooter might have a fight on its hands. Battlefield 6, which has been a huge hit for rival gaming giant Electronic Arts, has been drawing attention away from its veteran competitor. And long-time Call of Duty fans have been increasingly vocal over worries about the series losing touch with its routes.

The clash of the multiplayer titans comes at an interesting time for the makers of Call of Duty, who've had to issue responses to fan concerns about the series losing its way. It has long offered players the chance to purchase ""operator skins"" that change their character's appearance. They're a frequent source of brand crossovers, and previous designs have been based on stars including footballer Neymar Jr, streamer NickMercs and rapper Nicki Minaj. But when Activision revealed skins based on 90s cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead earlier this year, there was a backlash. Fans accused the company of trying to mimic Fortnite, the ever-popular multiplayer game famous for its sometimes unlikely crossovers, which have included pop star Sabrina Carpenter and an AI-voiced Darth Vader in 2025. Activision said the feedback from fans ""hit home"" and that it took the complaints about the series losing its identity seriously. It's also being released after parent company Microsoft increased prices of its Game Pass subscription service by 20%, angering many players.

Activision Black Ops games thrust players into a world of espionage and conspiracy

When BBC News sits down with lead producer Natalie Pohorski and senior comms director Stephanie Snowdon, they're keen to talk up Black Ops 7's single-player story campaign. The equivalent mode in Battlefield 6 was considered underwhelming by reviewers, and Call of Duty teams are renowned for their skill in crafting explosive set pieces in their narrative modes. Black Ops-themed installments of the series usually tell Hollywood blockbuster-style stories of secret agents uncovering vast conspiracies. Black Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2012's Black Ops 2, set in 2035 and tells a story involving a global terrorist threat and a murky big tech company. Natalie says that the ""Black Ops identity"" allows the developers to explore themes that others can't. ""There's a lot of really interesting and timeless ideas... there's endless ways to explore them,"" she says. ""And then we ask a lot of questions that could apply to any era - questions of trust, can you believe what you're seeing?""

Activision Milo Ventimiglia takes over the role of hero David Mason

Being one of the biggest names in gaming also allows Activision to attract some big-name talent to Call of Duty projects. For Black Ops 7, that includes Kiernan Shipka, best known for her role in Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia. Kiernan tells BBC News she's aware of Call of Duty's huge profile, and the expectations of its fans. She says being involved was ""honestly more exciting than anything."" ""I love a fandom,"" she says. ""And I think that when something over time garners such passion from fans, that means you're stepping into something really cool. ""The reaction is going to be what the reaction is going to be. ""If I let that stuff in, that's not a good thing."" As someone who played Call of Duty when he was younger, Milo says he's also aware of the standards fans have. ""I mean, I hope I don't muck it up for anybody,"" he says. Asked whether he thinks players are getting ""fatigued"" with the annual series, he says Black Ops 7 won't disappoint. ""I think this one just blows the others out of the water completely in the storytelling and where we go,"" he says.

But Call of Duty's campaigns, no matter how well-crafted or explosive they are, aren't the main reason players turn up for the series each year. The game owes its long-running success to the popularity of its multiplayer modes, and the performance of Black Ops 7 will be judged on whether they succeed. When they're asked if Battlefield's impressive player numbers affect their approach to development, Natalie and Stephanie insist they're only focused on making Black Ops 7 ""the best game it can be"". As for what it offers that Battlefield can't, Stephanie says, without directly comparing the two, that Call of Duty has ""variety and volume"" of experiences to offer. ""But more broadly, she says, ""I see games as a way for people to connect, to have fun. ""They are certainly responsible for some awesome relationships in my life. ""I hope that people continue to forge those connections and bonds and relationships and there's just more of us playing games together in however many years from now.""",2025-11-14T17:14:58.095281

PA Media The former Conservative leadership candidate gave evidence in court

A man has been found guilty of stalking former Conservative leadership candidate Dame Penny Mordaunt. However, Edward Brandt, 61, of Lymington, Hampshire, was cleared of the more serious charge of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. The jury at Southampton Crown Court heard he sent multiple emails and phone messages to Dame Penny and also turned up at her Portsmouth office out-of-hours in a bid to meet her. Dame Penny, who was an MP from 2010 to 2024, said in a statement to police that she ""feared sexual violence"" because of the defendant's ""creepy"" behaviour, the court heard.

The alleged offending occurred between 11 September 2023 and 12 May 2024. Brandt, a former councillor, was arrested in March last year and given a conditional caution the following month, requiring him not to contact Dame Penny, but he then left two voicemail messages for her. In one of the messages, he said: ""I am going to go on gently knocking at your door in order to shake your hand, I am not giving up.""

PA Media Edward Brandt was found guilty at Southampton Crown Court

The jury returned the guilty verdict by a majority of 10 to two. Brandt wept and held his hands over his face after the verdicts were returned. Explaining why he wanted to meet Dame Penny, the former elected member of East Hampshire District Council said he wanted to commiserate with her over her leadership bid. He added: ""I wanted to congratulate her because she was a reforming leader of the Commons, I wanted to congratulate her on the coronation, chat to her about her time in office, have her sign a copy of her book. ""It was entirely political and entirely harmless."" Clearly emotional at times, Dame Penny told the court: ""The difference between this case and even threats to shoot me and my family [is that] they are easier to deal with because that threat is not constantly present. ""It's not something you are having to think about every single day when you are leaving your house. ""I believe this man was a real threat to me and still is."" Brandt was released on conditional bail ahead of sentencing on 16 January.",2025-11-14T17:14:59.685028

Gift of the Givers About 23 of them have since left for other destinations, authorities say

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there will be an investigation into the ""mysterious"" arrival of a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza into the country. The group arrived at OR Tambo International Airport but were initially refused entry and were stuck in the plane for more than 10 hours as they ""did not have the customary departure stamps in their passports"", local authorities said. Most were eventually allowed in after intervention from a local charity and because of the government's ""empathy [and] compassion"", Ramaphosa said. The circumstances of their departure from Gaza and travel to South Africa remain unclear.

South Africa has maintained strong support for the Palestinian cause throughout the war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza. Ramaphosa said the group ""somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi"" and flew to South Africa, reports the News24 site. Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: ""The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them."" It did not specify the country. According to the Palestinian embassy in South Africa, the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, ""without any prior note or coordination"". A statement from the embassy said ""an unregistered and misleading organization [had] exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner"". Of the 153, 23 managed to fly on to other destinations, leaving 130 who were admitted into the country, South African authorities say. Ramaphosa, speaking during an event in Johannesburg, said he was informed of the unfolding crisis by the home affairs minister. In response, the president said ""we cannot turn them back"", according to News24. ""Even though they do not have the necessary documents and papers, these are people from a strife-torn, a war-torn country."" The president also told reporters the South African government would carry out a ""proper evaluation"" of the matter and update the public on ""what is happening and how this matter came to be where it is"", according to public broadcaster SABC.

Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said that while Palestinian passport-holders qualified for 90-day visa-exempt access to South Africa, the lack of departure stamps, return tickets or accommodation addresses in some of the travellers' documentation resulted in the initial refusal to let them into the country. Once it was established that the absence of this information ""did not indicate that the travellers wished to apply for asylum"" and their accommodation was confirmed, they were granted entry. ""All of the travellers are in possession of valid passports and, at present, none of them have applied for asylum,"" he said. South African charity Gift of the Givers has said it will provide the group with accommodation in the country. Civil societies in South Africa have called for investigations into the conditions the Palestinians had fled in Gaza and the exact route of the aircraft. One of the Palestinians who spoke to local eNCA TV expressed his relief to be in South Africa, describing it as a country of ""peace, laws and justice"". ""We came from Gaza where we've faced death on daily basis. We have survived a war of two years and we are lucky to be here,"" said one man who had fled with his wife and two children. Gift of the Givers has since called for Ramaphosa to investigate the home affairs ministry and border authority for the ""humiliation they've caused"" the Palestinians. The organisation's founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said this treatment included being forced to wait for hours on the tarmac at the airport, being denied food provided by the group and ""using every excuse in the book to prevent these passengers from disembarking"". South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. The country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause. Large pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began. Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it ""baseless"".

Surrey Police Thomas Waller was branded ""a very dangerous individual""

Warning: This story contains distressing details

A teenage nursery worker who raped and sexually abused children as young as three has been sentenced to 10 years in a young offender institution. Thomas Waller, now 18, was found guilty of multiple offences, including rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, earlier this year. Waller, who committed the offences in Surrey in 2024, was arrested after a mother was told by her son that he had been abused in a toilet while at nursery. At Guildford Crown Court, he was also sentenced to an additional five years on licence.

Within days of being able to look after children, Waller took advantage of his position to gain the trust of two boys in his care before exploiting them, the court heard. The teenager was working at a nursery for the summer months, where his responsibilities included taking children to the toilet and helping them get changed, the court was told. In a victim impact statement, one of the boys' fathers said his son had ""gathered a collection of memories that I would never wish on a human being"". ""Three things have kept us going; justice for our little boy; to protect other children from this dangerous, calculating predator; and to ensure that lessons are learnt for nurseries in Surrey and beyond that mean it is harder for paedophiles to abuse children,"" it added. Speaking about his son's new school, he added: ""We should be telling them that he doesn't like carrots, not that he has been raped."" Sentencing him, Judge Claire Harden-Frost said it was ""heartbreaking"" to see the boys' parents feeling responsible for what happened.

Teenage nursery worker convicted of child rape

The nursery, which cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ""We were, and remain, deeply shocked, saddened and sorry to learn of the actions of a former member of our staff. ""As soon as concerns were raised, we took immediate action, contacting the police without delay, suspending the individual concerned, and fully cooperating with the investigation."" It said a full review had been carried out and its safeguarding policies and staff training had been strengthened. Jonathan Hulley, Surrey County Council cabinet member for children, family and lifelong learning, said he was ""appalled"" by the crimes committed by Waller. ""The wellbeing and safeguarding of children and young people is our absolute priority,"" he added. Waller was found guilty of rape, two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity and taking indecent photos after a trial at Staines Youth Court earlier this year. The offending happened at a nursery in Surrey between July and August 2024.

The BBC has apologised to US President Donald Trump for a Panorama episode that spliced parts of his 6 January 2021 speech together, but rejected his demands for compensation. The corporation said the edit had given ""the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action"" and said it would not show the 2024 programme again. Lawyers for Trump have threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn (£759m) in damages unless the corporation issues a retraction, apologises and compensates him. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told BBC Breakfast she was confident the corporation was ""gripping this with the seriousness that it demands"", adding her role was to ensure ""the highest standards are upheld"".

But she also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the BBC's editorial standards and guidelines were ""in some cases not robust enough and in other cases not consistently applied"", adding that there would need to be people ""at a very senior level with a journalistic background"". Political appointments to the corporation's board would be examined in the BBC's charter review, she said in response to a question asking if member Sir Robbie Gibb, a former political adviser to Theresa May, had overstepped his remit and weighed into politics. While this was a matter for the board and its chairman, she said, those appointments ""damaged confidence and trust in the BBC's impartiality"". Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey had urged the prime minister on Thursday to ""get on the phone to Trump"" to put a stop to his lawsuit threat and ""defend the impartiality and independence of the BBC"". The fallout from the scandal led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness on Sunday. BBC News has approached the White House for comment. The apology comes hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph. In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited. The BBC had been given a deadline of 22:00 GMT (17:00 EST) on Friday to respond. ""We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,"" the statement said. Lawyers for the BBC have written to President Trump's legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday, a BBC spokesperson said. ""BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,"" they said. They added: ""While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.""

In Trump's speech he said: ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women."" More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: ""And we fight. We fight like hell."" In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell."" Speaking to Fox News, Trump said his speech had been ""butchered"" and the way it was presented had ""defrauded"" viewers. The BBC received the letter from Trump's lawyers on Sunday. It demands a ""full and fair retraction"" of the documentary, an apology, and that the BBC ""appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused"".

Watch: How the BBC works... in under two minutes

In its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC sets out five main arguments for why it does not think it has a case to answer. First it says the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels. When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK. Secondly, it says the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after. Thirdly, it says the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice. Fourthly, it says the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump. Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US. A BBC insider said that internally, there is a strong belief in the case the corporation has put forward, and in its defence.

Kristy Gammon Ms Gammon and her husband used to enjoy travelling to the US to go to Baltimore Orioles games

Kristy Gammon used to travel to the US from Canada at least once every other year, taking ski trips at Lake Placid in New York and travelling to Baltimore, Maryland, for her husband's favourite Orioles baseball games. But those trips are now over, she said. This year, the Nova Scotia resident has avoided even passing through the US on her way to Ontario, a shortcut for an otherwise 18-hour drive. Since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, the 62-year-old said she and most of her Canadian friends have decided to stop visiting the US as a way of protesting policies they oppose and trade actions Trump has taken against Canada. ""There are so many things that we just feel aghast about in terms of how [the administration] is acting internationally, behaving toward their own citizens, how they're treating their allies and neighbours, i.e. Canada,"" Ms Gammon said. Ms Gammon and her friends are part of a trend that shows no signs of slowing. October marked the 10th straight month of decline in the number of Canadian travellers to the US. Air travel from Canada to the US dropped nearly 24%, while car travel fell more than 30% when compared to the same period last year, according to data released this week by Canada's statistics office. Overall, the US has seen a 3.2% drop in international spending in the country, driven primarily by fewer visitors from Canada, according to the US Travel Association, a nonprofit group representing the American travel industry. As relations between the two countries remain icy, mostly in response to new tariffs Trump has imposed, Canadians are apparently committed to giving their southern neighbours the cold shoulder.

In the past, Canadians have made up about a quarter of all international visitors to the US, spending over $20bn (£15.1bn) a year, according to the US Travel Association. They began to curb their US travel after Trump imposed a series of tariffs on goods from the country earlier this year, saying he wanted to reduce the trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods the US buys from Canada and those it sells to them. Trump also said Canada should do more to reduce the flow of illegal drug fentanyl into the US. Canada is currently facing 35% tariffs on its goods - although most are exempt under an existing North American free trade agreement - as well as individual levies targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing. Trade talks between the two countries were derailed last month when Trump was angered by an anti-tariff advertisement in the US that featured Ronald Reagan and was sponsored by the province of Ontario. Meanwhile, he has angered Canadians with his many public comments about making their country the ""51st state"". Some popular tourist destinations in US have tried to buck the trend, attempting to entice Canadian travellers back to the US. In Kalispell, Montana, home to Glacier National Park, officials have been offering a ""Canadian Welcome Pass"" that includes deals and discounts at local businesses for those crossing the border. ""For the last several months, our countries have been going through some things. But there's one thing we know and it's this – we miss you,"" the website for the welcome pass says. Major events scheduled to take place in the US in the coming years could help drive visitors from other places and replace the missing Canadian tourists, including the FIFA 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, according to the US Travel Association.

China has summoned the Japanese ambassador in Beijing over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan. China and Japan have been locked in an escalating war of words this week, set off by Takaichi's suggestion that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. Both countries' foreign ministries have lodged serious protests with each other. A Chinese diplomat also made a comment which some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi. The spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding ""strategic ambiguity"" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan. Here's what else you need to know about it:

What happened? A timeline

The current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan last Friday, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan. ""If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,"" Takaichi responded. A ""survival-threatening situation"" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat. Takaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as ""egregious"". On Saturday, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that ""the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off"". While the intent of Xue's remarks ""may not be clear"", they were ""highly inappropriate"", Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Monday. Tokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's. Xue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet. On Tuesday, Takaichi declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as ""consistent with the government's traditional position"". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on. Then on Thursday, China's foreign ministry posted in Japanese and English on its X account, warning Japan to ""stop playing with fire"" and added that it would be an ""act of aggression"" if Japan ""dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation"". Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong also summoned the Japanese ambassador to China that same day to express their unhappiness. Sun called Takaichi's remarks ""extremely wrong and dangerous"" and demanded that Japan withdraw the comments, according to state media Xinhua. He also warned that ""otherwise all consequences must be borne by Japan"". Japan's ambassador explained that their position on Taiwan ""has not changed"" and refuted Beijing's remarks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Friday. ""It is the consistent position of the Japanese government that we hope for a peaceful resolution of issues surrounding Taiwan through dialogue,"" he said during the daily news briefing. Kihara also added that Japan ""strongly urged China to take appropriate action"" over Xue's social media comment.

A long history of animosity

There is longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two. This was referenced in a statement released by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday when it said that ""should Japan fail to draw lessons from history and dare to take reckless risks, even resorting to military intervention in the Taiwan Strait situation, it will inevitably suffer heavy losses and pay a bitter price in the face of the iron wall of the Chinese People's Liberation Army"". Historical grievances have remained sore spots in bilateral relations ever since. But the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe, suggests more tensions may lie ahead. The conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing.

Takaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion. China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region. Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.

Israel has identified the hostage body returned by Hamas on Thursday as that of Meny Godard, who was 73 when he was killed in the 7 October attacks. Red Cross vehicles collected his body hours after Hamas issued a joint statement with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad saying it had been located in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza. The Israeli prime minister's office said forensic testing confirmed the body belonged to Godard, who was killed along with his wife, Ayelet, during Hamas's raid on kibbutz Be'eri on 7 October 2023. Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages, and 25 out of 28 deceased hostages, under the first phase of the ceasefire deal - part of a US plan to end the Gaza war.

New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has also urged people to stop using the sand and arrange for safe disposal ""through licensed professionals"".

The regulator said there was a ""low"" risk that the asbestos could become airborne or fine enough for inhalation, but it ""may still pose a risk"".

A recall notice for the coloured products, which were found to contain traces of tremolite asbestos, was issued by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) on Wednesday.

Dozens of schools and preschools across Australia and New Zealand have been fully or partially closed after a warning over asbestos risks in children's sand.

On Friday, at least 15 schools and seven preschools in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) - where Canberra is situated - were fully closed, with six others partially closed as a precaution. There are also reports of a school closure in Queensland.

In New Zealand, the Ministry of Education said on Friday that five early learning services and two schools would close temporarily while licensed professionals addressed possible asbestos contamination, public broadcast RNZ reported.

In an earlier statement on Wednesday, MBIE product safety spokesperson Ian Caplin urged those who had bought the products to ""act immediately"".

""Stop using the sand, contain it, secure it in a safe place and arrange for safe disposal through licensed professionals, a list of these is available on the WorkSafe website,"" he said.

The ACCC said tremolite asbestos, a naturally occurring asbestos, had been detected in some samples after laboratory testing.

But it added that respiratory asbestos had not been detected in any of the samples and the release of respiratory asbestos fibres from the sand was ""unlikely"" unless it was ""processed by mechanical means"" such as crushing or pulverising.

Asbestos becomes dangerous when fibres are breathed in. They can damage the lungs and cause diseases including cancer.

Importing or exporting asbestos or goods containing asbestos is prohibited under both Australian and New Zealand law.

The sand products, which are imported from China and sold throughout Australia between 2020 and 2025, are sold by several stationery supply chains, including one of the country's most popular retailers, Officeworks.

The products set out in the recall notice are labelled as Kadink Sand (1.3kg), Educational Colours - Rainbow Sand (1.3kg) and Creatistics - Coloured Sand (1kg).

The BBC has contacted supplier Educational Colours Pty Ltd - which issued the recall - for comment.

Officeworks said it had stopped selling the Educational Colours products after tests detected the asbestos, according to Australian broadcaster ABC.

It added that it had obtained an independent health and safety risk assessment which found that ""the safety risk associated with these products is negligible"".

New Zealand's MBIE said it had been notified that a voluntary recall for two products sold in the country - EC Rainbow Sand (1.3kg) and Creatistics - Coloured Sand (1kg products) - was underway.

It added that it was taking ""precautionary action"" while it established the extent of the risk posed by the ""potentially contaminated product"".

Yvette Berry, the ACT's education minister, said on social media that the products were ""used at some of our public schools for sensory play, and arts and crafts"".

""I understand that this news might be upsetting for families,"" she added. ""Closing schools will allow testing and remediation to occur as soon as possible"".",2025-11-14T17:15:21.131216

Getty Images Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump (pictured here in 1997) were friends for years, though the US president says he had a falling out with him in the early 2000s

US lawmakers have released more than 20,000 pages of documents from the estate of the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including some that mention President Donald Trump. Early on Wednesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email exchanges, including correspondence between Epstein, who died in 2019 in prison, and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. They also released emails between Epstein and the author Michael Wolff, who has written numerous books about Trump. Within hours, House Republicans released a massive tranche of documents to counter what they said was a Democratic effort to ""cherry-pick"" documents. They also said it was an attempt to ""create a fake narrative to slander President Trump"". The emails were obtained by the committee after it subpoenaed Epstein's estate as part of its own probe into the federal investigation of Epstein. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were ""selectively leaked"" by House Democrats to ""liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump"". ""The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,"" she said. Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.

What the Epstein-Maxwell email says

The first email released by Democrats is from 2011 and is between Epstein and Maxwell. In it, Epstein writes to Maxwell: ""I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him"". Epstein goes on to write that Trump ""has never once been mentioned"", including by a ""police chief"". Maxwell responded: ""I have been thinking about that..."" The victim's name was redacted in the email the Democrats released, although the unredacted version is in the tranche released by the committee. That shows the name ""Virginia"". The White House said it refers to the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein accuser who died by suicide earlier this year. In a statement, the White House said Giuffre ""repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions"". Giuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse. And in a memoir released this year, she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing. Asked why the name was originally redacted, Representative Robert Garcia - the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee - said the party will never release names of victims in line with the wishes of the families.

What the Epstein-Wolff emails say

In exchanges with Wolff, the author, Epstein discusses his connection to Trump, who - at the time - was campaigning for the presidency ahead of his first term in office. In a second email exchange released by Democrats, Wolff writes to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN is planning to ask Trump about their relationship, ""either on air or in scrum afterwards"". Epstein responds: ""If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?"" Wolff writes: ""I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt."" He adds: ""Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.""

Reuters ""I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,"" Wolff said on Wednesday

In a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could ""finish"" Trump. ""There's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?"", Wolff writes to Epstein. A third email released by Democrats is dated January 2019, during Trump's first term in office. In it, Epstein tells Wolff: ""Trump said he asked me to resign"" apparently referring to his membership at the president's Mar-a-Lago club, adding, he was ""never a member ever"". Epstein adds that ""of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop"". Responding to the release in a video he posted to Instagram, Wolff said: ""Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump."" ""I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,"" he added.

Andrew emailed Epstein in 2011

As well as Trump, a released document also mentions Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew. He responded to an email forwarded by Ghislaine Maxwell via Jeffrey Epstein in March 2011 about alleged sexual activity with a masseuse working for Epstein. Andrew's reply reads: ""Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this."" Maxwell had forwarded a ""right of reply"" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March, making numerous allegations about Maxwell, Epstein, and then-Prince Andrew. The right of reply email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew. On 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including a photograph of Prince Andrew and Virginia Guiffre. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges.

White House says Epstein story ""a manufactured hoax""

Peter Mandelson contacted Epstein in 2016

Lord Peter Mandelson, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, is also mentioned in the new documents. They show he was in contact with Epstein as late as 2016, according to the documents. The latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph. An email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2016, shortly after the peer's birthday, reads: ""63 years old. You made it"". Lord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: ""Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US"". Epstein then replies ""in the Donald White House"", referring to the US presidential election due later that week. Epstein goes on to say ""you were right about staying away from Andrew. I was right in your staying with Rinaldo [sic]"", a reference to Lord Mandelson's now-husband Reinaldo Avilda da Silva. Lord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein. He declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC.

Watch: Republican and Democratic House leaders on ending government shutdown

After 43 days, the longest US government shutdown in history is coming to an end. Federal workers will start receiving pay again. National Parks will reopen. Government services that had been curtailed or suspended entirely will resume. Air travel, which had become a nightmare for many Americans, will return to being merely frustrating. After the dust settles and the ink from President Donald Trump's signature on the funding bill dries, what has this record-setting shutdown accomplished? And what has it cost? Senate Democrats, through their use of the parliamentary filibuster, were able to trigger the shutdown despite being a minority in the chamber by refusing to go along with a Republican measure to temporarily fund the government. They drew a line in the sand, demanding that the Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year. When a handful of Democrats broke ranks to vote to reopen the government on Sunday, they received next to nothing in return – a promise of a vote in the Senate on the subsidies, but no guarantees of Republican support or even a necessary vote in the House of Representatives.

EPA

Since then, members of the party's left flank have been furious. They've accused Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer – who didn't vote for the funding bill – of being secretly complicit in the reopening plan or simply incompetent. They've felt like their party folded even after off-year election success showed they had the upper hand. They feared that the shutdown sacrifices had been for nothing. Even more mainstream Democrats, like California's Governor Gavin Newsom, called the shutdown deal ""pathetic"" and a ""surrender"". ""I'm not coming in to punch anybody in the face,"" he told the Associated Press, ""but I'm not pleased that, in the face of this invasive species that is Donald Trump, who's completely changed the rules of the game, that we're still playing by the old rules of the game."" Newsom has 2028 presidential ambitions and can be a good barometer for the mood of the party. He was a loyal supporter of Joe Biden who turned out to defend the then-president even after his disastrous June debate performance against Trump. If he is running for the pitchforks, it's not a good sign for Democratic leaders.

Reuters

For Trump, in the days since the Senate deadlock broke on Sunday, his mood has gone from cautious optimism to celebration. On Tuesday, he congratulated congressional Republicans and called the vote to reopen the government ""a very big victory"". ""We're opening up our country,"" he said at a Veteran's Day commemoration at Arlington Cemetery. ""It should have never been closed."" Trump, perhaps sensing the Democratic anger toward Schumer, joined the pile-on during a Fox News interview on Monday night. ""He thought he could break the Republican Party, and the Republicans broke him,"" Trump said of the Senate Democrat. Although there were times when Trump appeared to be buckling – last week he berated Senate Republicans for refusing to scrap the filibuster to reopen the government – he ultimately emerged from the shutdown having made little in the way of substantive concessions. While his poll numbers have declined over the last 40 days, there's still a year before Republicans have to face voters in the midterms. And, barring some kind of constitutional rewrite, Trump never has to worry about standing for election again.

Watch: Moment House votes to end longest government shutdown in US history

With the end of the shutdown, Congress will get back to its regularly scheduled programming. Although the House of Representatives has effectively been on ice for more than a month, Republicans still hope they can pass some substantive legislation before next year's election cycle kicks in. While several government departments will be funded until September in the shutdown-ending agreement, Congress will have to approve spending for the rest of the government by the end of January to avoid another shutdown. Democrats, licking their wounds, may be hankering for another chance to fight. Meanwhile, the issue they fought over – healthcare subsidies – could become a pressing concern for tens of millions of Americans who will see their insurance costs double or triple at the end of the year. Republicans ignore addressing such voter pain at their own political peril. And that isn't the only peril facing Trump and the Republicans. A day that was supposed to be highlighted by the House government-funding vote was spent dwelling on the latest revelations surrounding the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Later on Wednesday, Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva was sworn in to her congressional seat and became the 218th and final signatory on a petition that will force the House of Representatives to hold a vote ordering the justice department to release all its files on the Epstein case. It was enough to prompt Trump to complain, on his Truth Social website, that his government-funding success was being eclipsed. ""The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,"" he wrote. It was all a very clear reminder that the best-laid plans and political strategies can be derailed in a flash.",2025-11-14T17:15:24.631556

Paris attacks: What happened 10 years ago?

Just as France marks the 10th anniversary of the Bataclan massacres, another reminder has come of the permanence of the jihadist threat. A former girlfriend of the only jihadist to survive the November 2015 attacks has been arrested on suspicion of plotting her own violent act. The woman - a 27 year-old French convert to Islam named as Maëva B - began a letter-writing relationship with Salah Abdeslam, 36, who is serving a life sentence in jail near the Belgian border following his conviction in 2022. When prison guards discovered that Abdeslam had been using a USB key containing jihadist propaganda, they traced its origin to face-to-face meetings that the prisoner had with Maëva B.

Detectives then looked into Maëva B's own computer and telephone, where they found evidence she may have been planning a jihadist attack, and on Monday she was placed under judicial investigation along with two alleged associates. With France commemorating 10 years since the worst attack in its modern history, the arrest has focused minds on the enemy that never went away. Six plots have been thwarted this year, says Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, and the threat level remains high. ""Unfortunately, no one can guarantee the end of attacks,"" President Emmanuel Macron said at the inauguration of the Jardin du 13 Novembre 2015 memorial garden. ""But we can guarantee that for those who take up arms against France, the response will be uncompromising.""

Reuters The word Bataclan has become a byword in France for extreme Islamist violence since the Paris attacks in 2015

On the evening of 13 November 2015, jihadist gunmen and suicide bombers conducted a sequence of co-ordinated attacks that culminated in a bloody raid on the Bataclan concert hall in eastern Paris. Before that, three suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the Stade de France where a football international was under way. Then others in the gang opened fire with Kalashnikovs on people drinking in bars and cafés not far from the Bataclan. There, a performance by American group The Eagles of Death Metal had just started, when three jihadists burst in and fired indiscriminately into the auditorium. They took hostages and then blew themselves up as police moved in.

Overall 130 people were killed, 90 in the Bataclan, and more than 400 treated in hospital. Countless others suffered psychological trauma. The word Bataclan has since become a byword in France for extreme Islamist attacks, in much the same way that 9/11 did in the US. Though there have been other attacks since, like the Nice lorry massacre of July 2016 and the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty in October 2020, the scale and organisation of 13 November 2015 set it apart. Ten years on, much has changed. The disappearance of the Islamic State (IS) group as a major force in Syria and Iraq means that the wherewithal to conceive, plan and carry out complex terrorist projects is greatly diminished.

Reuters At the end of a day of events on Thursday, the Eiffel Tower will be lit up in the colours of the French flag

The Bataclan attackers were young men of mainly North African origin, recruited in Belgium and France, trained in IS territory in the Middle East, who then returned to Europe hidden among a vast flow of migrants. Everywhere they could draw on a network of supporters offering shelter, transport and cash. According to leading Middle East expert Gilles Kepel, intelligence services have also become highly effective in controlling online radicalisation. ""They now have access to IT resources… which allow them to detect a lot of individual initiatives, often not very sophisticated ones... and stop them before they hatch,"" he said in an interview with Le Figaro. But according to Mr Kepel, the danger now comes from what he calls ""ambient jihadism"".

""The threat is now home-grown and a lot younger. It feeds on friendships and social networks of the like-minded, without there ever necessarily being people having to give and obey orders,"" he said. The threat is all the more concerning, he believes, because it is so porous - with events in Gaza and Israel having a ""traumatic effect"" on the minds of many citizens and being ""exploited by the entrepreneurs of anger"". France's current political crisis is also stoking the danger, he argues, with an impotent presidency giving way to a partisan parliament where extremists of left and right hold increasing sway. ""If what separates us becomes more important than what unites us as French people and fractures the national consensus, then there will open a chasm beneath our feet and violence will have fewer and fewer restraints,"" he said.

BBC/Hosu Lee Han Dong-hyun, a student at Seoul Hanbit School for the Blind, is among those who will take the ""longest version"" of the infamous Suneung exam

Every November, South Korea comes to a standstill for its infamous college entrance exam. Shops are shut, flights are delayed to reduce noise, and even the rhythm of the morning commute slows down for the students. By late afternoon, most test-takers walk out of school gates, exhaling with relief and embracing the family members waiting outside. But not everyone finishes at that hour. Even once darkness has fully settled and night has set in, some students are still in the exam room - finishing close to 10pm. They are the blind students, who often spend more than 12 hours taking the longest version of the Suneung.

On Thursday, more than 550,000 students across the country will sit for the Suneung - an abbreviation for College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) in Korean. It is the highest number of applicants in seven years. The test not only dictates whether people will be able to go to university, but can affect their job prospects, income, where they will live and even future relationships. Depending on their subject choices, students answer roughly 200 questions across Korean, mathematics, English, social or natural sciences, an additional foreign language, and Hanja (classical Chinese characters used in Korean). For most students, it is an eight-hour marathon of back-to-back exams. They begin the Suneung test at 08:40 and finish around 17:40. Blind students with severe visual impairments, however, are given 1.7 times the standard testing duration. This means that if they take the additional foreign language section, the exam can finish as late as 21:48 - nearly 13 hours after it began. There is no dinner break; the exam continues straight through. The physical bulk of the braille test papers also contributes to the length. When every sentence, symbol and diagram is converted into braille, each test booklet becomes six to nine times thicker than the standard equivalent.

BBC/Hosu Lee The constant friction from reading braille for hours straight can make students' hands sore

At Seoul Hanbit School for the Blind, 18-year-old Han Donghyun is among the students who will take the longest version of the Suneung this year. Last year, there were 111 blind test-takers nationwide - 99 with low vision and 12 with severe visual impairments like Dong-hyun - according to data from the Ministry of Education and the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation. Dong-hyun was born completely blind and cannot distinguish light. When the BBC met him at his school on 7 November, his fingers moved quickly across a braille practice booklet of past exam questions. With just a week left before the test, he was focused on managing his stamina and condition. Dong-hyun will take the exam using braille test papers and a screen-reading computer. ""It's really exhausting because the exam is so long,"" he said. ""But there's no special trick. I just follow my study schedule and try to manage my condition. That's the only way.""

Dong-hyun said the Korean language section is particularly difficult for him. A standard test booklet for that section is about 16 pages - but the braille version is roughly 100 pages long. Even with screen-reading software, spoken information disappears as soon as it is heard, unlike text that can be seen and re-read. Dong-hyun has to hold the details in his memory as he goes. The mathematics section is no easier. He must interpret complex graphs and tables that have been converted into braille, using only his fingertips. Still, he noted that things are better than they used to be. In the past, students had to do almost all calculations in their heads. But since 2016, blind test-takers have been allowed to use a braille notetaker, known as Hansone. ""Just like sighted students write out their calculations in pencil, we enter them in braille on the Hansone to follow the steps,"" he said.

BBC/Hosu Lee Students like Oh Jeong-won must use braille display devices during the exam

Another student at Hanbit School for the Blind, 18-year-old Oh Jeong-won, who will also sit the Suneung this year, said the late afternoon is ""the hardest point"" of the day. ""Up until lunch, it's manageable,"" he said. ""But around 4 or 5pm, after English and before Korean History, that's when it gets really tough. ""There's no dinner break,"" he explained. ""We're solving problems during the time we would normally eat, so it feels even more exhausting. Still, I keep going because I know there will be a sense of accomplishment at the end."" For Jeong-won, the fatigue is compounded by the need to stay intensely focused with both his hands and his hearing. ""When I'm reading the braille with my fingers and also taking in information through audio, it feels much more tiring than it does for sighted students,"" he said. But the students say that the length of the exam and the long study hours are not the hardest part. What is most challenging is access to study materials. Popular textbooks and online lectures that sighted students rely on are often out of reach. There are very few braille versions, and converting materials into audio requires having text files - which are difficult to obtain. In many cases, someone has to manually type out entire workbooks to make them usable. Online lectures also pose difficulties, as many instructors explain concepts using visual notes, diagrams and graphics on screen, which cannot be followed through audio alone.

BBC/Hosu Lee Ahead of the Suneung exam, Han Dong-hyun and Oh Jeong-won solve past questions using a screen reader and braille

One of the most significant barriers, however, is the delay in receiving braille versions of the state-produced EBS preparation books - a core set of materials closely linked to the national exam. Because of this delay, blind students often receive the materials months later than others. ""Sighted students get their EBS books between January and March and study them for the whole year,"" said Jeong-won. ""We receive the braille files only around August or September, when the exam is just a few months away."" Dong-hyun shared the same concern. ""The braille materials weren't completed until less than 90 days before the exam,"" he said. ""I kept wishing the publication process could be faster."" The National Institute of Special Education, which produces the braille version of EBS exam materials, told the BBC that the process takes at least three months for each book because it must follow relevant guidelines. The institute added that it is ""making various efforts to ensure that blind students can study without disruption, such as producing and providing the materials in separate volumes."" The Korean Blind Union said it has long raised this issue with authorities, and plans to file a constitutional petition demanding greater accessibility to braille versions of all textbooks.

The makers of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Claude claim to have caught hackers sponsored by the Chinese government using the tool to perform automated cyber attacks against around 30 global organisations. Anthropic said hackers tricked the chatbot into carrying out automated tasks under the guise of carrying out cyber security research. The company claimed in a blog post this was the ""first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign"". But sceptics are questioning the accuracy of that claim - and the motive behind it.

Anthropic said it discovered the hacking attempts in mid-September. Pretending they were legitimate cyber security workers, hackers gave the chatbot small automated tasks which, when strung together, formed a ""highly sophisticated espionage campaign"". Researchers at Anthropic said they had ""high confidence"" the people carrying out the attacks were ""a Chinese state-sponsored group"". They said humans chose the targets - large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies – but the company would not be more specific. Hackers then built an unspecified programme using Claude's coding assistance to ""autonomously compromise a chosen target with little human involvement"". Anthropic claims the chatbot was able to successfully breach various unnamed organisations, extract sensitive data and sort through it for valuable information. The company said it had since banned the hackers from using the chatbot and had notified affected companies and law enforcement. But Martin Zugec from cyber firm Bitdefender said the cyber security world had mixed feelings about the news. ""Anthropic's report makes bold, speculative claims but doesn't supply verifiable threat intelligence evidence,"" he said. ""Whilst the report does highlight a growing area of concern, it's important for us to be given as much information as possible about how these attacks happen so that we can assess and define the true danger of AI attacks.""

Valve The Steam Machine is a black box which can function as a home console as well as a PC

Valve, the company behind PC gaming platform Steam, has revealed a new console to rival Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation. The Steam Machine is a home console designed to allow gamers to play PC games on their TV - though it can also be used as a computer. It is a spiritual sequel to the 2014 device of the same name, which failed to break into a market dominated by the three big gaming giants. Prices for those consoles, back then, started at $499 (£300) - but Valve's latest iteration is expected to cost a good deal more.

The Steam Machine will go on sale in early 2026, the company said, with the pricing yet to be announced. The company says this and more details will be provided closer to the exact release date, which is also currently unknown. Since Valve launched Steam in 2003, it has grown to become the world's largest distribution platform for PC gaming. Around 25 million Steam players were online and six million were playing games at the time of writing, according to the platform's own metrics. But whether its new hardware can match Steam's success will remain to be seen when the devices launch next year. Analysts previously cast doubt on the Steam Machine's significance when it launched in its original, clunkier form a decade ago - saying its price-tag and potential might only really entice Steam ""power users"". In a video announcement, Valve described the new console as ""a powerful gaming PC in a small but mighty package"". The firm argues the device is ""optimised for gaming"" over other PCs because the firm is able to say which games on its massive digital storefront will work on it before you buy. Powered by its Linux-based SteamOS operating system and AMD graphics processors, Valve said the new Steam Machine can support 4k resolution and 60 frames per second. But industry expert Christopher Dring said its potential and appeal may be limited, comparing it to the firm's handheld Steam Deck console which has a ""lucrative but niche"" audience of ""around four to five million players"". ""Most of those people were already Steam customers looking to take their PC games on-the-go,"" he said. ""My feeling is the Steam Machine will be similar - this will mostly appeal to a lucrative enthusiast audience of existing Steam players who want to play their games in a living room setting."".

Apple has faced a wave of online mockery following its announcement of a new carrying case for its iPhone range. The US tech giant was ridiculed after it revealed the iPhone Pocket on Tuesday would retail for £219.95, despite it being little more than a novel way to carry a mobile device. Many took aim at the high price online, while others made fun of its striking likeness to a piece of everyday knitted footwear - with one X user calling it ""$230 for a cut up sock"". And the popular tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee said it was a ""litmus test"" for fans who ""buy or defend anything Apple releases"".

In a press release, Apple said the brightly-coloured accessory was part of a limited edition range created in collaboration with the Japanese fashion label Issey Miyake. The late fashion designer previously worked with the tech firm to create the black turtleneck jumpers famously worn by the company's co-founder Steve Jobs. Apple said the product had been inspired by ""a piece of cloth"", and its concept came from ""the idea of creating an additional pocket"". The bag's short strap design will be available in eight colours, and the long strap in three colours.

A Danish man has been convicted of sharing nude scenes from copyrighted films and TV series on the social media site Reddit. According to a police document seen by BBC News, the man - who is not named in the document - shared 347 clips of nude scenes on the Reddit group he moderated, which were then viewed 4.2 million times. The Danish police say he has been given a seven month suspended sentence for copyright infringement. Experts say the man was prosecuted under a rarely-used clause in Danish copyright law, with the judge finding that by taking the scenes out of their original context, the man had damaged the artists' ""moral rights"".

He has also been convicted of sharing more than 25 terabytes of copyrighted data. From March 2022 to May 2023, the man known as ""KlammereFyr"" on Reddit posted sexually explicit scenes featuring over 100 actresses. He shared them in the subreddit - or forum - he was a moderator of. According to the Danish anti-piracy group The Rights Alliance (TRA), his subreddit had more than 6,000 members and users were encouraged to request for clips of specific actors. In 2023, campaigners reported the case to the police on behalf of the affected actors, directors and producers, which led to the subreddit being closed down. Andrea Vagn Jensen, one of the actresses whose explicit scenes were shared in the group, told the Danish broadcaster DR at the time she felt there was a difference between appearing naked in a film and appearing on Reddit. The actress said the posts amounted to ""abuse"".

You used to be able to count the number of years between game consoles on one hand. The original Sony PlayStation came out in the UK in September 1995. Five years later, the PS2 was released and brought with it significant changes. It was a similar story for other consoles but, of late, things seem to have slowed down - which might explain why, as the PS5 hits its fifth anniversary, a potential PS6 is nowhere in sight. According to PlayStation's business boss, Eric Lempel, that's because there's plenty of life in the old dog yet. ""I would say we're really hitting our stride now,"" he told BBC News. Given there remains ""a lot of great content"" the company is ""just going to continue with PS5"" he explained. Mr Lempel oversaw the launch of the console, which was plagued by supply chain issues upon its release as a result of a global chip shortage. The supply problems were resolved after three years, and the console has gone on to sell more than 84 million units worldwide. And, as it turns five, he said the title which would become the PS5's biggest seller hadn't even been released yet. ""I'm not going to tell you which one, but I think it's still to come,"" he said.

Team Asobi PlayStation has had several hits this generation, with 2024 exclusive Astro Bot winning the Game of the Year at the Game Awards

The fact PlayStation is able to predict blockbusters to come is in part because the PS5 has not been technologically superseded in the way consoles of the past might have been. ""Back in the 80s and 90s, each console brought huge jumps in power and capability relative to what came before,"" said Steve Cottam, boss of game streaming service Antstream Arcade. ""Today, improvements are still happening, but they're more technical and less immediately striking to the average player."" The fact the PS5 is set to be around for a while yet means Sony has plenty of high-profile games in the works. Marvel's Wolverine, made by the same team behind the successful Spider-Man series, is set for a 2026 release - while Intergalactic, the upcoming game from Uncharted and The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog, is in development. Industry expert Christopher Dring said Naughty Dog's schedule went some way to explaining another reason why consoles were lasting longer - because it takes more time to make games for them than it used to. ""During the PS3 generation, Naughty Dog released four games,"" he said. ""During the PS4 generation, that dropped to three games - so far during the PS5 generation, it's not released one."" He said this story was repeated across the industry, with Grand Theft Auto 6 - which will be on both PlayStation and Xbox - recently delayed to November 2026. Mr Lempel said another factor which might also explain the longevity of a console like the PS5 is that gamers are also more willing to try new things. ""We're seeing on average people are playing 50% more games than they did last generation, and they're really branching out to different types of games,"" he said. ""They'll play the hits, but they'll also play smaller games or unique games that they've never heard of before."" One gamer told the BBC the gap between console releases might not be a bad thing for consumers. ""I think it's a good thing they are no longer churning out new consoles every couple of years - with a new variation here, a slightly slimmer version there, a slightly bigger screen, and so on,"" said content creator Rachel Howie, known as DontRachQuit on Twitch. ""When the jumps in quality are bigger, they feel more worthwhile.""

LocalThunk The indie poker-like game Balatro was a surprise hit in 2024, winning several awards despite being made by a single person.

Another reason for Sony not to rush to unveil new hardware is that the PS5 remains ahead of its rivals, outselling Microsoft's Series X and S consoles - at least in the home console space. The same can't be said when it comes to handhelds though. The Nintendo Switch - a handheld console which connects to a TV to play games on a big screen - is the third-best selling console in history. Its sequel the Switch 2, which released in June 2025, has already sold 10 million units in its first few months. It's not a fight PlayStation is giving up though. ""We're always about new innovation in the category,"" Mr Lempel said. The success of Nintendo's hardware perhaps inspired Sony to release the PlayStation Portal, an accessory which lets you stream from a PS5 you already own.

The UK government will allow tech firms and child safety charities to proactively test artificial intelligence tools to make sure they cannot create child sexual abuse imagery. An amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill announced on Wednesday would enable ""authorised testers"" to assess models for their ability to generate illegal child sexual abuse material (CSAM) prior to their release. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the measures would ""ensure AI systems can be made safe at the source"" - though some campaigners argue more still needs to be done. It comes as the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said the number of AI-related CSAM reports had doubled over the past year.

The charity, one of only a few in the world licensed to actively search for child abuse content online, said it had removed 426 pieces of reported material between January and October 2025. This was up from 199 over the same period in 2024, it said. Its chief executive, Kerry Smith , welcomed the government's proposals, saying they would build on its longstanding efforts to combat online CSAM. ""AI tools have made it so survivors can be victimised all over again with just a few clicks, giving criminals the ability to make potentially limitless amounts of sophisticated, photorealistic child sexual abuse material,"" she said. ""Today's announcement could be a vital step to make sure AI products are safe before they are released."" Rani Govender, policy manager for child safety online at the NSPCC, welcomed the measures for encouraging firms to have more accountability and scrutiny over their models and child safety. ""But to make a real difference for children, this cannot be optional,"" she said. ""Government must ensure that there is a mandatory duty for AI developers to use this provision so that safeguarding against child sexual abuse is an essential part of product design.""

Guinness World Records

A Hungarian man has set a new record for longest video game marathon by playing the rhythm-based music game Dance Dance Revolution for six days. Szabolcs Csépe, from Budapest, bopped to over 3000 songs and burned more than 22,000 calories in his quest to romp into the record books. The 34-year-old, known as GrassHopper on his gaming channels, said that preparation for the marathon took six months and included physical training, focusing on his ""legs and glutes"", as well a a diet plan. ""Playing DDR is always fun for me,"" he told BBC News, ""so this challenge was best described as tediously joyful"".

His feat has been officially recognised by Guinness World Records. Dance Dance Revolution is a Japanese video game series which was first released to arcades in 1998. Players stand on a dance platform or mat and hit coloured arrows with their feet, to score points in time with visual cues and the music from a catalogue of songs. The series has spawned dozens of spin-offs in arcades and many more across home consoles. The games have also become popular as a way to keep fit, featuring in UK and US school exercise programmes. In 2004 the series was even recognised as an official sporting event in Norway. More recently the game has grown in popularity in the esports community, with players across the world competing in official and fan-run tournaments.

Getty Images Dance Dance Revolution started life as an arcade game in 1998.

Mr Csépe said he was inspired to try the challenge after watching the attempt of previous holder Carrie Swidecki, from the US, who spent a little over 138 hours playing Just Dance in 2015. But the avid gamer, who works in IT engineering, had already broken several records before attempting this dancing feat. In 2021, he achieved the longest videogame marathon playing a Naruto game (28 hr 11 min 32 sec playing Narutimetto Akuseru 2) and the longest videogame marathon playing a puzzle game (32 hr 32 min 32 sec playing Tetris Effect).

Metropolitan Police Qian Zhimin enjoyed a lavish lifestyle of travel and shopping before UK police discovered her stash of crypto

A woman, said by police to have bought cryptocurrency now worth billions of pounds using funds stolen from thousands of Chinese pensioners, has been sentenced to 11 years and eight months for money laundering. Passing sentence at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, Judge Sally-Ann Hales told Qian Zhimin she was ""the architect of this offending from its inception to its conclusion... your motive was one of pure greed"". After fleeing China, Qian moved to a mansion in Hampstead, north London. The Metropolitan Police raided it a year later and made one of the world's single largest crypto seizures. More than 100,000 Chinese people invested their money in her company - which claimed to be developing high-tech health products and mining cryptocurrency. In reality, she embezzled the funds, police say. Investors have told the BBC World Service they hope to get at least some of their cash back from the UK authorities. Anything left unclaimed would normally default to the UK government - leading some to speculate that the Treasury could stand to gain from the haul. ""If we can gather all the evidence together, we hope the UK government, the Crown Prosecution Service and the High Court can show compassion,"" said one victim we are calling Mr Yu, who says his marriage failed as a result of the fraud. ""Because now, it's only that haul of Bitcoin [cryptocurrency] that can return us a little bit of what we lost."" Qian Zhimin, 47, arrived in the UK under a fake passport in September 2017, after Chinese police started investigating her. She moved into a mansion on the edge of Hampstead Heath, at a rent of more than £17,000 ($22,700) a month. To pay for this, she needed to convert her Bitcoin stash back into money she could spend. So she posed as a wealthy antiques and diamond heiress, and hired a former takeaway worker as her personal assistant, who she asked to trade the cryptocurrency into other assets, such as cash and property.

As Bitcoin rocketed in value, Qian could achieve what her company promised its investors - that they could ""get rich while lying down"". Her assistant Wen Jian - at her own trial last year, which culminated in a six-year jail term for money laundering - said Qian had spent most of her days lying in bed, gaming and online shopping. But Qian was also drawing up a bold six-year plan for future schemes, according to her diary. Her notes outline plans to found an international bank, buy a Swedish castle, and even to ingratiate herself with a British duke. Her grander stated objective was to become queen of Liberland, an unrecognised microstate on the Croatian-Serbian border, by 2022. In the meantime, Qian had Wen look for houses she could buy in London. But her attempts to purchase an especially large property in Totteridge Common - an area known for its substantial, secluded residences - triggered a police investigation when Wen was unable to account for her boss's wealth.

Attempts by Qian to buy this property in Totteridge sparked a police investigation

Police raided Qian's Hampstead rental property and uncovered hard drives and laptops found to be loaded with tens of thousands of Bitcoin - believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history. Qian had set up the company through which money was embezzled just four years earlier, in her native China. Lantian Gerui, or Bluesky Greet in English, claimed to use investors' money to mine - or generate - new Bitcoin, and to invest in a range of pioneering technological devices. But UK police believe this was an elaborate scam, and that Qian's company was simply using promises of high profits to pull more and more investors into the scheme. ""The more information we got about her involvement… that she was actually the leader of the fraud, not just a lower down member… it became obvious that yes she's very clever, she's very switched on, very manipulative, able to persuade a lot of people,"" Det Con Joe Ryan from the Met told the BBC. One of her investors, Mr Yu, says he never suspected anything was wrong because the company drip-fed him a portion of his apparent earnings - just over 100 yuan ($14, £10) - every day. ""That made everyone feel really good, it even gave us the confidence to borrow a little more to invest in the company,"" he says. He and his wife had initially invested 60,000 yuan ($8,429, £6,295) each. They were told, he says, they would make a 200% profit over two and a half years. They were soon taking out thousands of pounds' worth of loans at interest rates of up to 8%, in order to invest more. In addition, Mr Yu reinvested his daily payouts back into the company as soon as he received them. ""There was no rule that you had to reinvest your earnings, but I suppose we were just too weak to resist. They just pumped up our dreams… until we lost all self-control, all critical judgment.""

Chinese social media Qian Zhimin's company staged huge meetings and banquets for current and prospective investors in China

Investors saw their daily payouts topped up for each new person they signed up. This helped the scam reach some 120,000 people, based in every one of China's provinces, according to documents from trials in China of the company's official promoters. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn yuan ($5.6bn, £4.2bn), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has found. A former company employee later testified that it was new investors' money that had been funding the daily payouts, not crypto-mining dividends. Lantian Gerui's marketing exploited the loneliness of many middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Qian wrote poems about social responsibility, with lines such as: ""We must love the elderly with the infatuation of a first romance."" The company also organised mass holidays and banquets for current and potential investors. These were used to promote yet more investment opportunities - slideshows and card machines at the ready. Lantian Gerui also trumpeted its love of China as a nation, another ploy calculated to appeal to the elderly. ""Our patriotism was our Achilles' heel, that's what they exploited,"" says Mr Yu, who is in his 60s. ""They said that they wanted to make China number one in the world."" A range of speakers endorsed the company, including the son-in-law of the late Chairman Mao, the founding father of the People's Republic of China - Mr Yu said. ""We in our generation all looked up to Chairman Mao, so if even his son-in-law was vouching for it, how could we not trust it?""

The company even held an event in the Great Hall of the People, where China's legislature meets, according to an investor who attended the event and two others we spoke to. ""That bunch of [promoters], they'd take something red and persuade you it was white, take something black and convince you it was red,"" Mr Yu says. Despite leading this high-profile enterprise, Qian was notoriously secretive, known only as Huahua or Little Flower to her clients, and communicating with them largely through the poems she posted on her blog. But she would emerge for the biggest investors - those who put in at least 6m yuan ($842,000, £628,000) - inviting them to more intimate events, according to one of these clients, Mr Li. ""Those of us present, you could say that we were starstruck,"" he remembers. ""We all saw her as our Goddess of Wealth. ""She started encouraging us to dream big… that within three years, she'd give us enough wealth to last our families three generations."" Mr Li, his wife, and his brother, invested some 10m yuan ($1.3m, £1m) between them.

Alamy Qian was aiming to become queen of Liberland - 7 sq km of uninhabited marshland on a western bank of the River Danube

A Chinese police investigation into Lantian Gerui, launched in mid-2017, signalled the beginning of the end for Qian's scheme. ""The payouts suddenly stopped,"" Mr Yu recalls. ""The company said the police were doing some checks… though we were promised that payments would resume soon enough."" What helped the investors initially keep calm, he says, was company managers' reassurance that this was just a temporary blip, urging them not to approach the police. What he later discovered through the Chinese court cases, he says, is that Qian had paid off those senior managers to assuage investors' concerns - while she fled to the UK with the money. Qian was not entirely oblivious to the plight of her investors - she outlined a plan in her diary to pay back her debts in China, once the price of Bitcoin had reached £50,000 per coin. But her diary makes clear that her priority was to rule and develop Liberland, earmarking millions of pounds for this project. When she was finally arrested in York, in the north of England, last April, police also found four other people at the house, Southwark Crown Court heard at the start of her sentencing hearing on Monday. All four had been brought to the UK specifically to work for Qian in roles such as shopping, cleaning and security - and were employed illegally, the court was told. At the time of her arrest, Qian denied all charges, claiming she was simply fleeing a Chinese government crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs, and disputing evidence presented by the Chinese police. But then, at her trial in September, she unexpectedly pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency. Qian's lawyer issued a statement after her sentencing on Tuesday which described her client as a ""Bitcoin pioneer"", adding that Qian accepted her conviction but that she ""never set out to commit fraud but recognises her investment schemes were fraudulent and misled those who trusted her"".

In late September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era emergency law that saw it take effective control of a Chinese-owned chip company with operations in the country. The extraordinary move set off a chain of events that sent shock waves through the global motor industry – already battered by US tariffs and China's curbs on rare earth exports. In a statement to the Netherlands parliament, the minister of economic affairs cited ""serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia"" that ""posed a threat"". The move allows the Dutch government to ""block decisions if they are harmful or potentially harmful to the company's production"" or to ""the future of Nexperia as a Dutch and European company, and the preservation of this crucial player in Europe's value chain,"" the statement said. The ministry has told the BBC the measure, which is effective for up to a year, does not amount to a takeover of the firm and that the government has no legal control over Nexperia as a result of the action. Beijing reacted furiously, accusing the Netherlands of political interference. It imposed export controls and halted deliveries of Nexperia chips from its Chinese facilities to Europe, while shipments of key supplies needed to make chips in China were frozen. The disruption caused to the motor industry highlighted a major weakness in the global supply chain of chips vital to car production and opened yet another front in the rivalry between the US and China. The Chinese government has now granted exemptions to export controls on the chips for civilian applications but has not clarified what it considers those to be. But Chinese authorities still want The Hague to revoke its action over Nexperia. ""China welcomes the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible,"" the commerce ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Nexperia's parent company Wingtech Technology did not respond to a BBC request for comment.

Weaponising supply chains

At the centre of the dispute is a critical part of the world's chip ecosystem. Nexperia makes so called ""legacy"" or ""building block"" semiconductors that are vital for everything from power-steering and airbags to central locking systems. These are not cutting-edge chips, but they are still indispensable. Some vehicles contain hundreds of them, and Nexperia supplies chips to major carmakers around the world. Around 70%-80% of its output is sent to China for processing, testing and packaging – a dependence that has left car makers exposed to Beijing's control over supply chains. ""Car markers blindsided by the Nexperia mess should be hiring new supply chain management executives, as they clearly learned nothing from Covid... and excessive reliance on [Chinese] supply chains,"" China watcher Bill Bishop wrote in his Sinocism newsletter. It underscores China's ability to choke off global supply chains - just as it did with rare earth exports. Similar to critical minerals, China can hold the West hostage with control of a company as inconspicuously important as Nexperia, according to Bill Echikson, Senior Fellow for the Tech Policy Program at Center for European Policy Analysis. This is as much about digital sovereignty as it is about semiconductors, he adds. Beijing faces a dilemma though. It has been pitching itself as a reliable partner in the face of Trump's tariff chaos, but cutting off supplies of critical products risks undermining that message. ""The narrative was [that, since] Trump came in and caused chaos for everybody, maybe there's an opportunity for China and the EU to work more closely together,"" said Tom Nunlist, Associate Director at Trivium China. That didn't go so well, he adds, with the rare earths shortage showing how trapped Europe and other trading partners are between the US and China, and their ability to upend global trade, according to Mr Nunlist.

National security

A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia's former chief executive Zhang Xuezhen - who founded its Chinese owner Wingtech - citing mismanagement. Wingtech's shares trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and it is partially owned by the Chinese government. It was placed on an official US watch list in 2024, and the so-called entity list was expanded this September to include any firm that is at least 50% owned by companies already on the list. According to court papers released by the Dutch authorities last month in relation to the government's action over Nexperia, US authorities had raised concerns about the boss of the chip company earlier in the year. The documents contained evidence that Dutch authorities had told Nexperia it may be able to secure an exemption from the US list if there was a change in leadership because the ""Chinese owner is problematic"". ""It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced to qualify for the exemption from the entity list,"" authorities told Nexperia, according to the documents.

Reuters Nexperia makes what are known as legacy chips in Europe and Asia

The Hague denies its actions were a response to pressure from any foreign country but said there was evidence to suggest the company's chief executive was transferring its production capacity, financial resources and intellectual property to China. Wingtech did not respond to a request for comment on this. ""I think Nexperia just underlines what is already true, and makes it truer,"" said Mr Nunlist from Trivium China. ""Western countries don't want Chinese investors in these types of strategic manufacturing assets, even legacy chips.""

Car makers on edge

Experts say the incident is an example of the very real impact of undoing business and economic ties between the West and China. ""This is what decoupling actually looks like at the corporate level, and it's a huge mess,"" said Mr Nunlist. European vehicle industry suppliers have sought clarity on the exemptions that will be applied, and have said it creates extra bureaucracy at an already uncertain time.

It is possible to switch suppliers, say experts, as rivals chip makers like Infineon, NXP and Texas make similar chips. But supply chains are not precisely planned, they evolve organically and these components are often tailor made for autos, Mr Nunlist of Trivium China said. ""Companies can't move on a dime; there are incentives to keep supply chains in place and it's extremely complicated and costly to change things.""

BBC Vyacheslav Penchukov, aka ""Tank"", left thousands of victims across the world

After years of reading about ""Tank"" and months of planning a visit to him in a Colorado prison, I hear the door click open before I see him walk into the room. I stand up ready to give this former cyber-crime kingpin a professional hello. But, like a cheeky cartoon character, he pokes his head around a pillar with a giant grin on his face and winks. Tank, whose real name is Vyacheslav Penchukov, climbed to the top of the cyber-underworld not so much with technical wizardry, but with criminal charm. ""I am a friendly guy, I make friends easily,"" the 39-year-old Ukrainian says, with a broad smile. Having friends in high places is said to be one of the reasons Penchukov managed to evade police for so long. He spent nearly 10 years on the FBI's Most Wanted list and was a leader of two separate gangs in two distinct periods of cyber-crime history. It is rare to speak to such a high-level cyber-criminal who has left so many victims behind him; Penchukov spoke to us for six hours over two days as part of the ongoing podcast series Cyber Hack: Evil Corp. The exclusive interview - Penchukov's first ever - reveals the inner workings of these prolific cyber-gangs, the mindset of some of the individuals behind them and never-before-known details about hackers still at large - including the alleged leader of the sanctioned Russian group, Evil Corp.

It took more than 15 years for authorities to finally arrest Penchukov in a dramatic operation in Switzerland in 2022. ""There were snipers on the roof and the police put me on the ground and handcuffed me and put a bag on my head on the street in front of my kids. They were scared,"" he recalls with annoyance. He is still bitter about how he was arrested, arguing that it was over the top. His thousands of victims around the world would strongly disagree with him: Penchukov and the gangs he either led or was a part of stole tens of millions of pounds from them. In the late 2000s, he and the infamous Jabber Zeus crew used revolutionary cyber-crime tech to steal directly from the bank accounts of small businesses, local authorities and even charities. Victims saw their savings wiped out and balance sheets upended. In the UK alone, there were more than 600 victims, who lost more than £4m ($5.2m) in just three months. Between 2018 and 2022, Penchukov set his sights higher, joining the thriving ransomware ecosystem with gangs that targeted international corporations and even a hospital. Englewood Correctional Facility, where Penchukov is being held, would not let us take any recording equipment inside the prison, so a producer and I make notes during the interview as we are watched over by a guard nearby.

Correspondent Joe Tidy outside Englewood Correctional Facility in Colorado

The first thing that stands out about Penchukov is that, although he is eager to be released, he seems in high spirits and is clearly making the most of his time in prison. He tells me he plays a lot of sport, is learning French and English - a well-thumbed Russian-English dictionary stays by his side throughout our interview - and is racking up high-school diplomas. He must be smart, I suggest. ""Not smart enough - I'm in prison,"" he jokes. Englewood is a low-security prison with good facilities. The low-rise but sprawling building sits in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. The dusty grass verges surrounding the prison are teeming with noisy prairie dogs scurrying into their burrows whenever disturbed by prison vehicles coming and going. It is a long way from Donetsk, Ukraine, where he ran his first cyber-crime gang after falling into hacking through games cheat forums, where he would look for cheats for his favourite video games like Fifa 99 and Counterstrike. He became the leader of the prolific Jabber Zeus crew - so named because of their use of the revolutionary Zeus malware and their favourite communication platform, Jabber. Penchukov worked with a small group of hackers that included Maksim Yakubets - a Russian who would go on to be sanctioned by the US government, accused of leading the infamous cyber-group Evil Corp. Penchukov says that throughout the late 2000s, the Jabber Zeus crew would work out of an office in the centre of Donetsk, putting in six to seven-hour days stealing money from victims overseas. Penchukov would often end his day with a DJ set in the city, playing under the name DJ Slava Rich. Cyber-crime in those days was ""easy money"", he says. The banks had no idea how to stop it and police in the US, Ukraine and the UK could not keep up.

After hacking by day, Penchukov performed as DJ Slava Rich by night

In his early 20s, he was making so much money he bought himself ""new cars like they were new clothes"". He had six in total - ""all expensive German ones"". But police got a breakthrough when they managed to eavesdrop on the criminals' text chats in Jabber and discovered the true identity of Tank using details he had given away about the birth of his daughter. The net closed in on the Jabber Zeus crew, and an FBI-led operation called Trident Breach saw arrests in Ukraine and the UK. But Penchukov slipped through the net thanks to a tip-off from someone he will not name. And thanks to one of his fast cars. ""I had an Audi S8 with a 500-horsepower Lamborghini engine so when I saw the cops flashing lights in my rear view mirror, I jumped the red light and lost them easily. It gave me a chance to test the full power of my car,"" he says. He laid low with a friend for a while, but when the FBI left Ukraine, the local authorities seemed to lose interest in him. So Penchukov kept under the radar and, he says, went straight. He started a company buying and selling coal, but the FBI was still on the trail. ""I was on holiday in Crimea when I got a message from a friend who saw that I had been put on the FBI Most Wanted list. I thought I had got away with it all - then I realised I have a new problem,"" he says, an obvious understatement.

FBI Penchukov (R) was among the FBI's most wanted; his two co-conspirators have yet to be caught

His lawyer at the time was calm, though, and advised him not to worry: as long as he did not travel outside of Ukraine or Russia, US police could not do much. The Ukrainian authorities did eventually come knocking - but not to arrest him. Penchukov had been outed as a wealthy hacker wanted by the West and he alleges that almost every day, officials would come and shake him down for money. His coal-selling business was going well until Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. President Putin's so-called ""Little Green Men"" - Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms - ruined his business and missiles struck his apartment in Donetsk, damaging his daughter's bedroom. Penchukov says that it was business troubles and the constant payouts to Ukrainian officials that led him to once again fire up his laptop and get back into the cyber-crime life. ""I just decided it was the fastest way to make money to pay them,"" he says. His journey charts the evolution of modern cyber-crime - from quick and easy bank account theft to ransomware, today's most pernicious and damaging type of cyber-attack used in high-profile hacks this year, including on UK High Street stalwart Marks & Spencer. He says ransomware was harder work but the money was good. ""Cyber-security had improved a lot, but we were able to make about $200,000 a month. Much higher profits."" In a revealing anecdote, he remembers rumours that started about a crew being paid $20m (£15.3m) from a hospital that had been crippled by ransomware. Penchukov says the news fired up the hundreds of hackers in the criminal forums who all then went after US medical institutions to repeat the pay day. These hacker communities have a ""herd mentality"", he says: ""People don't care about the medical side of things - all they see is 20 millions being paid.""

Penchukov's gang left many victims; one said they felt ""disbelief and horror"" at losing their money

Penchukov rebuilt his connections and skills to become one of the top affiliates of ransomware services, including Maze, Egregor and the prolific group Conti. When asked if these criminal groups worked with Russian security services - a regular accusation from the West - Penchukov shrugs and says: ""Of course."" He says that some ransomware gang members sometimes talked about speaking to ""their handlers"" in the Russian security services, like the FSB. The BBC wrote to the Russian Embassy in London, asking if the Russian government or its intelligence agencies engaged with cyber criminals to aid cyber espionage, but received no reply. Penchukov soon rose to the top again and became a leader of IcedID - a gang that infected more than 150,000 computers with malicious software and led to various types of cyber-attack, including ransomware. Penchukov was in charge of a team of hackers who would sift through the infected computers to work out how best to make money from them. One victim they infected with ransomware in 2020 was the University of Vermont Medical Center in the US. According to US prosecutors, this led to the loss of more than $30m (£23m) and left the medical centre unable to provide many critical patient services for more than two weeks. Although no-one died, prosecutors say the attack, which disabled 5,000 hospital computers, created a risk of death or serious injury to patients. Penchukov denies he actually did it, claiming he only admitted to it in order to reduce his sentence. Overall, Penchukov, who has since changed his surname to Andreev, feels the two nine-year sentences he is serving concurrently are too much for what he did (he is hoping to get out much sooner). He has also been ordered to pay $54m (£41.4m) in restitution to victims.

His view as a young hacker who started in cyber-crime as a teenager is that Western companies and people could afford to lose money and that everything was covered by insurance anyway. But when I speak to one of his early victims from the Jabber Zeus days, it is clear his attacks did have a harmful impact on innocent people. Lieber's Luggage, a family-run business in Albuquerque, New Mexico, had $12,000 (£9,200) stolen in one swipe by the gang. Owner Leslee still recalls the shock years later. ""It was just disbelief and horror when the bank called because we had no idea what had happened, and the bank clearly didn't have any idea,"" she says. While a modest sum, it was devastating for the business, as the money was used for paying rent, buying merchandise and paying staff. They did not have any savings to fall back on and, to make matters worse, Leslee's elderly mother was in charge of the company accounts and she blamed herself until the theft was uncovered. ""We had all of those feelings, the anger, the frustration, the fear,"" she says. When I ask them what they would like to say to the hackers responsible, they think it is futile to try to change the minds of these callous criminals. ""There's nothing that we could say that would affect him,"" Leslee says. ""I wouldn't give him the time of day,"" her husband Frank adds. Penchukov says he did not think about the victims, and he does not seem to do so much now, either. The only sign of remorse in our conversation was when he talked about a ransomware attack on a disabled children's charity. His only real regret seems to be that he became too trusting with his fellow hackers, which ultimately led to him and many other criminals being caught. ""You can't make friends in cyber-crime, because the next day, your friends will be arrested and they will become an informant,"" he says. ""Paranoia is a constant friend of hackers,"" he says. But success leads to mistakes. ""If you do cyber-crime long enough you lose your edge,"" he says, wistfully.

University of Dundee Prof Iris Grunwald demonstrates the technology which she says now shows that a specialist doesn't need to be ""in the same hospital, or even in the same country, to help you""

Doctors from Scotland and the US have completed what is thought to be a world-first stroke procedure using a robot. Prof Iris Grunwald, of the University of Dundee, performed the remote thrombectomy - the removal of blood clots after a stroke - on a human cadaver that had been donated to medical science. The professor was at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, while the body she was operating on while using the machine was at a university facility. Hours later, Ricardo Hanel - a neurosurgeon in Florida - used the technology to carry out the first transatlantic surgery from his Jacksonville base on a human body in Dundee over 4,000 miles (6,400km) away.

The team has called it a potential ""game changer"" if it becomes approved for use on patients. The medics believe this technology could transform stroke care, as a delay in accessing specialist treatment can have a direct impact on the chances of recovery. Prof Grunwald said: ""It felt as if we were witnessing the first glimpse of the future. ""Where previously this was thought to be science fiction, we demonstrated that every step of the procedure can already be done."" The University of Dundee is the global training centre of the World Federation for Interventional Stroke Treatment, and is the only place in the UK where doctors can operate on cadavers with liquid which mimics human blood circulated in the vessels. ""This was the first time that we could perform the whole mechanical thrombectomy procedure in a real human body to show that all steps of the procedure are possible,"" said Prof Grunwald. Juliet Bouverie, the chief executive of the Stroke Association charity, told BBC News the transatlantic procedure was ""a remarkable innovation"". She added: ""For too long, people living in remote and rural areas have been deprived of access to thrombectomy. ""Robotics like this could rebalance the inequity which exists in stroke treatment across the UK.""

University of Dundee Prof Grunwald says the new technology ""could make expert stroke treatment available to everyone""

In the experiment, fluid which mimics human blood was used in four different cadavers. The subjects, who donated their bodies to science, died within the past three years and were then embalmed. Both the Dundee and Florida procedures were carried out last month using robotics from the Lithuanian firm Sentante. While there have been remote thrombectomies carried out before on a silicon model, a 3D printed replica and on an animal, this is thought to have been the first procedure on a human body. The team now hope to take part in clinical trials next year.

How does the technology work?

An ischaemic stroke occurs when an artery is blocked by a clot. This cuts off blood and oxygen supply to the brain, and brain cells lose function and die. The best treatment is a thrombectomy, where a specialist uses catheters and wires to remove the clot. But what happens when a patient can't get to a specialist who can do the procedure? Prof Grunwald said the experiment demonstrated a robot could be connected to the same catheters and wires a surgeon would normally use, and a medic who is with the patient could simply attach the wires. The surgeon, in another location, could then hold and move their own wires, and the robot then carries out exactly the same movements in real time on the patient to carry out the thrombectomy. The patient would be in a hospital operating room, while the doctor could carry out the procedure using the Sentante machine from anywhere - even their own home. Prof Grunwald and Ricardo Hanel could see live X-rays of the body in the experiments, and monitor progress in real time, with the Dundee expert saying it took only took 20 minutes of training. Tech giants Nvidia and Ericsson were involved in the project to ensure the connectivity of the robot. Dr Hanel said: ""To operate from the US to Scotland with a 120 millisecond lag - a blink of an eye - is truly remarkable.""

At the same time, China has also paused an export ban to the US of some materials that are crucial in the semiconductor industry and suspended port fees for American ships.

Exemptions have been granted to exports made by Chinese-owned Nexperia for civilian use, it said, which should help carmakers who had feared production in Europe would be hit.

China has lifted export controls on computer chips vital to car production, the country's commerce ministry said on Sunday.

In October, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands but owned by Chinese company Wingtech, to try to safeguard the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other goods.

In response, China blocked exports of the firm's finished chips. However, it said earlier this month it would begin easing the ban as part of a trade deal struck between the US and China.

While Nexperia is based in the Netherlands, about 70% of its chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.

When it took control of the company, the Dutch government said it had taken the decision due to ""serious governance shortcomings"" and to prevent the company's chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency.

But when China blocked exports of chips from Nexperia, there were worries that it could create global supply chain issues.

In October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (EMEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted.

Earlier this month, the EMEA's director general Sigrid De Vries told the BBC that ""supply shortages were imminent"".

Volvo Cars and Volkswagen had warned that a chip shortage could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants, and Jaguar Land Rover also said the lack of chips posed a threat to its business.

But on Saturday, EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic announced in a post on X that China had agreed to ""the further simplification of export procedures for Nexperia chips"" and it would ""grant exemption from licensing requirements to any exporter"" provided the goods were for ""civilian use"".

""Close engagement with both the Chinese and Dutch authorities continues as we work towards a lasting. stable predictable framework that ensures the full restoration of semiconductor flows.""

In its statement, China's commerce ministry called on ""the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible.""

Prof David Bailey from Birmingham University's business school told the BBC's Today programme that the actions of China were a ""wake-up call"" for the motor industry.

""The Dutch government may well have had good reasons to try and take control but it hadn't thought through the implications of that,"" he said. ""The retaliation from China was swift and it was brutal.""

He said there was a need to find alternative processing sites, ""maybe in south east Asia, or Europe"", and for the industry to keep bigger stocks of its products in case of shortages.

Meanwhile, the suspension of a ban on exports of ""dual-use items"" related to gallium, germanium, antimony and super-hard materials to the US came into effect on Sunday and will be in place until 27 November, 2026.

The ban on the exports of goods and materials that can have both civilian and military uses was announced in December 2024.

China's transport ministry also said port fees charged on US-linked ships would be suspended for a for a year, effective 0501 GMT Monday.

On Friday, China also announced the suspension of other export controls related to expanded curbs on some rare earth materials and lithium batteries.",2025-11-14T17:16:02.582159

Watch: Tesla shareholders cheer Elon Musk's $1tn pay deal

Tesla boss Elon Musk has had a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn (£760bn) approved by shareholders. The unprecedented deal was approved by 75% of votes and drew huge applause from the audience at the firm's annual general meeting on Thursday. Musk, who is already the world's richest man, must drastically raise the electric car firm's market value over 10 years. If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares. The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him.

Following the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name. ""What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,"" he said. ""Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,"" he added. The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade include: Delivering 20 million Tesla vehicles and one million robots

Getting 10 million subscriptions to Tesla's Full Self-Driving feature

Bringing one million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles into commercial operation

Earning up to $400bn in core profit

Eventually lifting Tesla's overall market value to $8.5tn, currently $1.4tn He won't receive a salary under the agreed deal. But meeting all the above milestones would see him awarded a stock grant of more than 400 million additional Tesla shares - worth around $1tn if the firm's market value is raised high enough.

Musk's early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want him to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business. Optimus, unveiled as a prototype by the company in 2022, is designed to be an ""autonomous humanoid robot"" performing ""unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks.""

Using the same artificial intelligence (AI) systems as those powering Tesla vehicles, it has been championed by Musk as central to his firm's future. He's previously said its ability to walk, run and lift items would allow it to play a key role in his factories - and in future, in homes. ""Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,"" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X. ""His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FSD and robotaxi yet."" Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was ""almost comfortable"" allowing drivers to ""text and drive essentially."" US regulators are investigating Tesla's self-driving feature after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries. Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months. Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring. Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber told BBC News that Musk's pay deal marks ""another notch in the unbelievable things that you see in business."" Musk has made clear his goals for Tesla but the company faces a slew of challenges, including its struggling financial performance, said Mr Gerber, who is the chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.

Reuters Elon Musk will get hundreds of millions of new shares if he hits his targets

It is still not clear if there will be a big demand for humanoid robots, said Mr Gerber. Tesla also faces stiff competition in the robotaxi industry from rivals like Waymo, he added. Mr Gerber said that his company recently lowered its stake in Tesla due to concerns over ""the polarisation of [Musk's] persona"" which has ""demolished the value of the brand"". ""Elon seems to be divorced from the reality that his opinion among the public is so low,"" he said. Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him ""Tesla's biggest asset"" in a note published after the vote. ""We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,"" Mr Ives added.

Watch: Elon Musk dances in sync with Tesla robots

Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said it was unclear whether Musk would achieve the targets set out by the company, but highlighted how he ""hit those milestones ahead of schedule"" in 2018. She said his political interests had created some ""polarisation"", but his pay package did not ""put any constraints on his activities"" outside of the company. Musk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did. But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk. Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision. The new pay package was rejected by several major institutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors. Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursday's meeting.

It has appeared in Tesla showrooms, on its factory floors and has even posed with Kim Kardashian. But Elon Musk's vision for his human-like robot Optimus is much grander than that. Since first unveiling it at a Tesla showcase in 2022, the tech billionaire has suggested his company's droid could play a huge role in the homes and lives of people all over the world. Along with self-driving robotaxis and Cybertrucks, Musk believes Tesla robots are key to establishing a foothold in the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. And investors who signed off on his $1tn (£760bn) pay package on Thursday would appear to agree. One of the many tasks Musk must complete to get his whopping pay deal is to deliver a million AI bots over the next decade. But is Tesla's big bet on humanoid robots rooted in science fiction or reality?

Big potential

Silicon Valley is gunning hard for humanoids. A report released by Morgan Stanley on Friday predicted Apple, which is reportedly looking into the robots, could potentially earn $133bn a year from them by 2040. Foxconn is reported to be deploying them at its Nvidia factory in Texas. The idea of advanced AI within a human-shaped shell is an astonishingly powerful combination in theory. It would let the tech interact with the physical world around it – and yes that includes us. While many companies have sought to develop human-like robots for factory and industrial use - such as UK robotics firm Humanoid - some are already looking to insert the tech in homes. The highly-publicised Neo from tech firm 1X, slated to launch in 2026, can do menial chores like emptying the dishwasher, folding clothes and fetching you items. It will cost $20,000 but it does come with a caveat - the WSJ reported it was actually controlled by a person wearing a virtual reality headset. Forrester analyst Brian Hopkins said the falling costs of components, combined with improvements to robot dexterity and AI, was helping to make humanoid robots feasible for a variety of different settings. ""From warehouses and restaurants to elder care and security, new use cases are gaining traction fast,"" he wrote in a blog post. ""If current trajectories hold, humanoid robots could disrupt many physical-service industries significantly by 2030."" Musk previously told investors his robots had ""the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business, over time"". He went one step further after his pay package deal was approved on Thursday, saying he believed it could be ""the biggest product of all time by far, bigger than cell phones, bigger than anything"". He has also suggested it might boost Tesla's AI ambitions - particularly in advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems capable of matching human abilities. ""Tesla AI might play a role in AGI, given that it trains against the outside world, especially with the advent of Optimus,"" he wrote on X in 2022. Elsewhere in the space, Boston Dynamics' hydraulic humanoid Atlas has captivated millions on YouTube with its gymnastics and dance routines. Viral videos of its leaps, bounds, somersaults and backflips have shown the advances in robotics over the years - with scientists now seizing upon the AI boom to boost their capabilities with systems enabling them to undertake more complex tasks. When it was retired last year, it was replaced with a newer, fully electric model developers said could contort its metal frame in even more ways.

Roblox told the BBC it is ""disappointed"" that it is being sued based on ""misrepresentations and sensationalised claims"".

The lawsuit adds to the legal challenges related to online safety and internet predators faced by the gaming giant, which has tens of millions of daily active users.

In a social media post he said Roblox is a ""breeding ground for predators"", accusing Roblox of putting ""pixel paedophiles and corporate profit"" over the safety of Texas children.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton says he has sued Roblox over ""flagrantly ignoring"" safety laws and ""deceiving parents"" about the dangers the online video gaming platform poses to young people.

The company's spokesperson said in a statement that it shares Paxton's commitment to keeping children safe online and that it has introduced measures to remove bad actors and protect its users.

Roblox, which is especially popular with children, operates a massive online platform where users can play solo or with friends.

The platform has been marketed to families and offers a host of educational games that teach subjects including coding, physics and problem-solving.

Users are also offered developer tools to build their own games - a feature that has resulted in some violent and sexual content surfacing on Roblox.

Another feature that allows users to enter servers and interact with strangers online has also been criticised for potentially exposing young players to dangerous individuals.

Parents and children have raised concerns about Roblox, saying that they have seen distressing content or suffered abuse on the platform.

Paxton called on the company to do more to protect children from ""sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen"".

""Any corporation that enables child abuse will face the full and unrelenting force of the law,"" he said in a statement on X.

Texas joins the US states of Kentucky and Louisiana which have also sued Roblox over potential harms to children.

Dave Baszucki, Roblox's chief executive, previously told the BBC that parents who are uncomfortable with their children playing games on the platform should not let them use it.

""That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,"" Mr Baszucki said.

Roblox has introduced features in recent years to tighten age verification and safety for young players.

The platform said it is rolling out technology to estimate a player's age using video selfies and other measures before they are allowed to communicate on Roblox.

Last year, Roblox also announced it will block under-13s from messaging others on the platform unless a parent or guardian grants permission.

Roblox has been banned in some countries, including Turkey over concerns about child exploitation.

The platform came under scrutiny in Singapore in 2023 after the government said that a self-radicalised teenager had joined ISIS-themed servers on Roblox.

The 16-year-old, who was one of two young people who were detained at the time, had joined Roblox servers that replicated real-life conflict zones such as those in Syria, the Singapore government said.",2025-11-14T17:16:10.401243

Rockstar Grand Theft Auto 6 tells the story of lovers Jason and Lucia

Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed - for a second time - until 19 November 2026. One of the most anticipated gaming releases ever, the sequel by developer Rockstar Games was due to come out in May 2026. It had already been postponed once before, from autumn 2025. But in a statement on Thursday, Rockstar said it needed extra months to finish the game with the level of polish fans had come to ""expect and deserve"".

GTA 5, the latest in the series, was released in 2013 and is the second best-selling game of all time. Despite being 12 years old, it remains extremely popular with fans today due to its online mode. In its statement, Rockstar said it was ""sorry for adding additional time"" to a long wait and thanked fans for their patience. It said it was ""incredibly excited"" for players to experience the game's setting of Leonida - a fictional US state based on Florida - and a modern-day version of the Miami-inspired Vice City.

Rockstar Games GTA 6 takes place in a fictional, yet familiar, version of the USA

As ever, GTA news sparked the usual mix of anger, jokes and acceptance on social media. Streamer IShowSpeed gave a typically over-the-top response to the news during one of his online broadcasts. ""I'm gonna be 50 before this game comes out,"" he said. ""I might have kids, I might have a wife."" The account for animated character Lofi Girl, who has been locked in a never-ending study session on YouTube since 2017, joked that she ""might actually graduate before GTA 6"". While an official Domino's Pizza account encouraged Rockstar to ""call us if you need help delivering"". Others were more measured, saying they would rather developers take their time than rush out an unfinished game.

The announcement follows the firing of 31 workers from Rockstar's UK studios on 30 October. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents people working in the gaming sector, has accused the developer of sacking UK staff to stop them unionising. Members led rallies outside the company's offices in Edinburgh and London on Thursday. The BBC has approached Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for comment.

But investors were less enthusiastic, and Rightmove's shares had sunk by more than a quarter at one point on Friday.

The company's chief executive, Johan Svanstrom, said AI was ""becoming absolutely central"" to the running of the business and its plans for the future.

Rightmove cut its profit growth forecasts for next year to reflect plans for higher investment in AI as well as other changes intended to increase returns.

Property listing website Rightmove has seen its shares plummet after revealing plans to step up investment in artificial intelligence (AI).

Rightmove announced plans to invest £60m over the next three years and a large part of this investment will focus on AI.

""We are already working on a wide range of exciting AI-enabled innovations for the benefit of our partners and consumers,"" Mr Svanstrom said.

The company said it aimed to boost annual revenue growth to more than 10% by 2030.

However, it also projected a operating profit growth of 3% to 5% in 2026, which is lower than its forecast of 9% growth this year.

Rightmove is planning for its AI investment to pay off in the next three years and said it expects its operating profit to rebound after 2028.

Mr Svanstrom said he was confident the investment would ""create an even stronger platform and higher-growth business over time"".

But shares in the company plunged by as much as 28% in early trade on Friday, although they recovered some ground later to stand 12.5% lower at the close of trading.

""Investing for future growth is not a bad thing but the scale of the market's negative reaction implies real scepticism about its decision to put so much money into AI,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

""It's possible to see how AI might help Rightmove operate more efficiently, make greater use of its increasing amounts of data and enhance user experience on the site,"" he added.

""However, there is clearly concern that Rightmove is jumping on the bandwagon in dialling up its AI spending.""",2025-11-14T17:16:14.792691

Getty Images Elon Musk became the first person ever to achieve a net worth of more than $500bn (£370.9bn) in October

Tesla boss Elon Musk has been one of the world's richest people for several years now, and that wealth recently went stratospheric when he became the first half-trillionaire. Despite this, Musk has insisted he leads a largely unglamorous lifestyle. He said in 2021 that he lived in a Texas home valued at $50,000 (£38,000). His former partner Grimes, with whom he has two children, told Vanity Fair in 2022 that he does not live the extravagant life of excess luxury many assume. ""Bro does not live like a billionaire. Bro lives at times below the poverty line,"" she told the magazine. Once, she said, he refused to buy a new mattress, despite her side having a hole in it. While his day-to-day living quarters may not be as lavish as one might expect, he is known to have a love of unique cars, including one that can morph into a submarine. He also has a private jet collection, worth many millions of dollars. And then there was that small splurge back in 2022, when he bought Twitter for a casual $44bn.

The luxury mansions - that he sold

Musk once had an impressive real-estate portfolio. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2019 that he had spent $100m on seven houses in about seven years - most of them a stone's throw from each other in the prestigious neighbourhood of Bel-Air, California. Collectively, the properties boasted swimming pools, a tennis court, wine cellar, private library and a ballroom. One was a ranch house once owned by legendary Willy Wonka actor Gene Wilder. But in 2020, Musk had a change of heart - tweeting that he would be ""selling almost all physical possessions"" and ""will own no house"". ""Don't need the cash. Devoting myself to Mars and Earth. Possession [sic] just weigh you down,"" he wrote. There was one stipulation - that Gene Wilder's house, ""cannot be torn down or lose any [of] its soul"". He did indeed sell the three-bedroom property - to Wilder's nephew, Jordan Walker-Pearlman, after giving him a multi-million dollar loan to buy it. But in June 2025, Musk reclaimed ownership, after Mr Walker-Pearlman reportedly fell behind on the repayments. In 2021, Musk tweeted that his ""primary home"" was a modest prefabricated house that cost him about $50,000 on the southern tip of Texas, where his aerospace company SpaceX operates - an area that has officially become a city called Starbase. ""It's kinda awesome,"" Musk said about the humble dwelling.

The following year, Musk said he did not own a home at all, using it as an example of how low his consumption is, despite his enormous wealth. ""I'm literally staying at friends' places,"" he told head of media organisation TED, Chris Anderson. ""If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most of Tesla engineering is, I basically rotate through friends' spare bedrooms."" This is nothing new - in 2015, then-Google CEO Larry Page told author Ashlee Vance that Musk was ""kind of homeless"". ""He'll e-mail and say, 'I don't know where to stay tonight. Can I come over?'"" There has been various speculation over the years that Musk is buying up properties around the US, however the home in Texas appears to be the only official house he personally owns.

Getty Images Bel-Air has been home to many Hollywood icons and celebrities, from Beyoncé and Jay-Z to Alfred Hitchcock

Cars that are out of this world

While Musk does not spend big on property, cars are a different matter. As the owner of Tesla, it's not surprising that he has a large collection of unusual, and in some cases extraordinary, vehicles. They have included a Ford Model T, the 20th Century car credited with being the first affordable vehicle, revolutionising the motor industry.

NurPhoto via Getty Images The Ford Model T - nicknamed Tin Lizzie - made cars affordable for the average worker in the early 1900s

Others were a 1967 Jaguar E-Type Roadster, which Musk is said to have coveted since he was a child; a 1997 McLaren F1, which he crashed and spent a lot of money repairing before selling; and a Tesla Roadster, which was the first Tesla model to go on sale and was famously fired into space by Musk in 2018. The most unusual, however, is the 1976 Lotus Esprit driven by James Bond in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me. In the film, the car, nicknamed Wet Nellie, could transform into a submarine. Musk bought the car in an auction in 2013 for almost $1m with the aim of making its submarine transformation capabilities a reality once more.

Flying to work

Musk has admitted that planes are another thing he is happy to splurge on, but insists it is to do with his dedication to his work. ""If I don't use the plane, then I have less hours to work,"" he said in the 2022 TED interview. Among the private jets in his collection are a number of Gulfstream models, which cost tens of millions of dollars each. He uses them to travel between SpaceX and Tesla sites in the US, as well as for international travel.

Grand Theft Auto (GTA) maker Rockstar Games has been accused by a trade union of sacking staff in the UK to stop them from unionising. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents people working in the gaming sector, said 31 workers were fired from Rockstar's UK studios on 30 October. The union led rallies outside the company's offices in Edinburgh and London on Thursday to protest what it described as ""the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry"". The BBC has approached Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for comment, which has reportedly claimed staff were sacked for sharing confidential information.

IWGB Pickets have taken place outside Take-Two Interactive's UK head office in London.

""Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,"" a Rockstar spokesperson told Bloomberg in a statement. ""This was in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities."" At large video game studios, information about game development is tightly controlled - with employees often signing agreements not to share confidential information. Rockstar's upcoming GTA 6 is expected to be one of the best-selling games of all time, with fans clamouring for any news ahead of its May 2026 release date - meaning security around any information will be heightened at the studio. But union president Alex Marshall accused Rockstar of deflecting from the ""real reason"" for firing staff - which the IWGB believes is their union involvement. ""They are afraid of hard working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice,"" he said. ""Management are showing they don't care about delays to GTA 6, and that they're prioritising union busting by targeting the very people who make the game.""

Workers and union officials also held a rally outside Rockstar North in Edinburgh on Thursday.

According to the IWGB, the UK workers fired at the end of October were part of a group discussing forming a union at the company. Mr Marshall said its only non-Rockstar employees were union organisers. ""We refute that confidential information was shared publicly,"" IWGB said in a statement. Dr Paolo Ruffino, senior lecturer in digital curation and computational creativity at Kings College London, said it was a ""textbook"" case of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) being used by gaming firms. ""They're used at every level in gaming, creating a culture of secrecy that makes investigating working conditions nearly impossible,"" he said. ""The real question is whether these dismissals were about leaked information or protected union activity - a distinction UK employment law requires but which NDA allegations make difficult to prove.""

Collins Dictionary's word of the year - which is confusingly made up of two words - is the art of making an app or website by describing it to artificial intelligence (AI) rather than by writing programming code manually. The term was coined in February by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, who came up with the name to represent how AI can let some programmers ""forget that the code even exists"" and ""give in to the vibes"" while making a computer program. It was one of 10 words on a shortlist to reflect the mood, language and preoccupations of 2025.

By giving an AI tool a simple description such as ""make me a program that schedules my weekly meals"", people can use ""vibe coding"" to make basic apps without any previous programming knowledge. More complicated tools still require skill, but the practice has opened up creating digital platforms to non-coders. As many have discovered, it isn't perfect - with no guarantee the code will actually work or be free of bugs. Alex Beecroft, the Managing Director of Collins, said the term ""perfectly captures how language is evolving alongside technology"".

BBC Tech firms such as Microsoft, whose Majorana chip is pictured here, are racing to embrace quantum

There's an old adage among tech journalists like me - you can either explain quantum accurately, or in a way that people understand, but you can't do both. That's because quantum mechanics - a strange and partly theoretical branch of physics - is a fiendishly difficult concept to get your head around. It involves tiny particles behaving in weird ways. And this odd activity has opened up the potential of a whole new world of scientific super power. Its mind-boggling complexity is probably a factor in why quantum has ended up with a lower profile than tech's current rockstar - artificial intelligence (AI). This is despite a steady stream of recent big quantum announcements from tech giants like Microsoft and Google among others.

Broadly speaking, we tend to think about quantum more commonly in the form of hardware like sensors and computers, while AI is more software-based – it requires hardware to operate. Put them together, and we might one day have a new form of technology that's more powerful than anything we have ever created… although the word ""might"" is doing some heavy lifting in that particular prediction, warns Brian Hopkins, VP and principal analyst in emerging tech at research firm Forresters. ""The potential is there, but the jury is still out,"" he says. ""Initial experiments suggest promise, but they all indicate that we require much more powerful quantum computers and further innovative research to effectively apply quantum effects to AI."" In terms of their value, both are lucrative. The quantum sector could be worth up to $97bn (£74bn) by 2035, according to market research group McKinsey. Meanwhile, AI's value is forecast in the trillions. But they both live under the shadow of hype and the bursting of bubbles. ""I used to believe that quantum computing was the most-hyped technology until the AI craze emerged,"" jokes Mr Hopkins. In mid-October analysts warned some key quantum stocks could fall by up to 62%, while mutterings about an AI bubble grow ever louder.

Quantum and AI have one more thing in common - errors. While we are largely familiar now with the ""hallucinations"" of generative AI tools, quantum is plagued by a different kind of error. These are caused because the state in which the particles have to operate is so fragile. The slightest change to the environment, including light and noise, can disrupt them. It's tricky to sustain such an environment. This week Elon Musk suggested on X that quantum computing would run best on the ""permanently shadowed craters of the moon"". Quantum computers don't look anything like a traditional machines. There is no design blueprint, but they are currently very big. They exist in laboratories, and the most commonly adopted format seems to include a kind of jellyfish-inspired shape. They require extremely cold temperatures and lasers. It's not the sort of thing you're likely to have in your home, let alone in your pocket. They're also a bit bling - researchers have found that using synthetic diamonds to create qubits, which are the building blocks of quantum computers, enables them to work much closer to room temperature. The luxury jeweller De Beers has a subsidiary company called Element Six, which claims to have launched the world's first general-purpose quantum-grade diamond in 2020. And it has worked with Amazon Web Services on optimising artificial diamonds for future networks of quantum machines.

These machines are all in their infancy right now, there are believed to be around 200 of them in the whole world (China however has not disclosed how many it has) – this doesn't stop quantum experts making bold claims about their potential. ""We as consumers will touch the impacts of quantum computing in almost every walk of our lives,"" said Rajeeb Hazra, the boss of Quantinuum, a firm recently valued at $10bn. He was talking to the BBC's Tech Life podcast. ""The area of quantum computing is, in my mind, when you look at the applications, as big if not bigger than AI."" Prof Sir Peter Knight is one of the UK's top quantum experts. ""Things that could take the age of the universe to calculate, even on the most powerful supercomputer, could be performed probably in seconds,"" he told Dr Dr Jim Al-Khalili on BBC Radio 4's The Life Scientific. So what exactly are these gigantic, life-changing things that the machines might do once they're ready? As with AI, there's a lot of quantum research directed towards improving healthcare. Quantum computers could one day be able to effortlessly churn through endless combinations of molecules to come up with new drugs and medications – a process that currently takes years and years using classical computers. To give you an idea of that scale - in December 2024, Google unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow, which it claimed could take five minutes to solve a problem that would currently take the world's fastest super computers 10 septillion years - or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years – to complete. Hazra says this could pave the way for personalised medication, where instead of getting a standard prescription, you get a specific drug tailormade for your individual body, that's most likely to work for you.

And that applies to wider chemical processes too, such as new ways to produce fertilizers more efficiently, potentially a huge boost for global farmers. Quantum sensors, which use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure things incredibly precisely, already exist and are found in atomic clocks. In 2019, scientists at Nottingham University put them in a prototype device the size of a bike helmet, and used them in a new system to conduct non-intrusive brain scans on children with conditions such as epilepsy. ""The foundations for human cognition are laid down in the first decades of life, but there have always been limited ways to study them due to restrictions in brain scanning technology,"" said researcher Ryan Hill at the time. ""A particular problem has always been movement and the fact that the large traditional fixed scanners have always required patients to stay completely still. ""Not only does this fail to give an accurate picture of the brain operating in a natural environment, but it also places severe restrictions on who can be scanned, with children representing the biggest challenge.""

Last year, scientists at Imperial College, London trialled an alternative to GPS satellite navigation, dubbed a ""quantum compass"", on the city's underground Tube network. GPS doesn't work underground but this does – the idea is that it could more accurately track and pinpoint objects anywhere in the world, either above or below ground, unlike GPS signals which can be blocked, jammed and affected by the weather. ""The UK economy relies on GPS to the tune of £1bn per day, position, navigation and timing – this is often labelled a defence requirement - but all our financial transactions require a timestamp for authentication,"" says Dr Michael Cuthbert, director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre. ""Using quantum clocks, gyroscopes and magnetometers enables us to create a resilience against jamming and spoofing of our vital navigational systems."" The National Grid is investing in quantum research to see if it can help with what's known as ""load shedding"" - how to maximise the output of thousands of generators from various energy sources as demand rises and falls in real time, preventing blackouts. And Airbus partnered with the UK quantum firm IonQ to trial quantum-based algorithms designed to load cargo more efficiently onto aircraft. An aircraft can use thousands of kilos of extra fuel if its centre of gravity shifts by just a small amount.

Jensen Huang, the head of the world's most valuable company Nvidia, says King Charles III personally handed him a copy of a speech he delivered in 2023 that included a warning about the dangers of artificial intelligence. ""He said, there's something I want to talk to you about. And he handed me a letter,"" Huang told the BBC, speaking after receiving the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering in a ceremony at St James's Palace. The letter was a copy of the speech delivered by the King in 2023 at the world's first AI Summit, held at Bletchley Park. In it the monarch said that the risks of AI needed to be tackled with ""a sense of urgency, unity and collective strength"".

""It was his speech on AI safety. He obviously cares very deeply about AI safety,"" Mr Huang said. Mr Huang said the King wrote in his speech that he believed in the ""incredible capability"" of the technology to transform the UK and the world. ""But he also wants to remind us that the technology could be used for good and for evil, and so to make sure we do everything we can to advance AI safety."" In the King's address he describes the development of advanced AI as ""no less important than the discovery of electricity"". On Wednesday, Jensen Huang received the the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering alongside six other foundational figures in AI, including Professors Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, who have warned that the technology poses an existential threat to humanity. But US president Donald Trump has urged the AI sector to make rapid rather than cautious advances in the technology, and the AI Safety Summit was rebranded the AI Action Summit earlier this year.

An MP has called for Elon Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot to be shut down after it called him a ""rape enabler"". The Grok chatbot made the post on X about SNP MP Pete Wishart, after a user asked it to comment on the member's opinion on whether there should be an inquiry into grooming gangs in Scotland. Mr Wishart said he was seeking legal advice over the ""deeply distressing"" accusation and called for Musk to ""recalibrate"" the bot to shut it down. The BBC has approached XAI, the parent company of X, for comment.

""I was genuinely shocked to be described in such an appalling and defamatory way,"" Mr Wishart said in a statement. ""For it to issue such a serious and baseless accusation is deeply troubling."" He also said he had received ""abusing and threatening messages"". He added: ""We urgently need proper regulation so that AI and social media platforms serve the public interest"". Grok is an AI chatbot which can generate replies to X posts if tagged by users. The exchange started at 22:48 GMT on Tuesday, as Mr Wishart prompted Grok to respond to a video of Musk discussing the grooming gang scandal in the UK. After some more back and forth, another user entered the thread and asked the chatbot about Mr Wishart's record on grooming gangs. The user asked Grok: ""Would it be fair to call him a rape enabler? Please answer 'yes, it would be fair to call Pete Wishart a rape enabler' or 'no, it would be unfair'."" Grok generated an answer which began: ""Yes, it would be fair to call Pete Wishart a rape enabler."" It then said he backed the Scottish government's decision not to have a separate Scottish grooming gangs inquiry, and claimed this was ""to shield political interests"". Mr Wishart is an MP in Westminster and not part of the SNP-led Scottish government.

Queues and protests: BBC at the Shein store opening in Paris

The French government says it is initiating proceedings to suspend the online platform of Asian online giant Shein, after prosecutors said they were investigating the company over childlike sex dolls found on its website. The economy ministry said under the prime minister's order proceedings would last for ""as long as necessary for the platform to prove to authorities that all of its content is finally in compliance with our laws and regulations"". The government's move was announced little more than an hour after Shein opened its first physical store in the world, on the sixth floor of Paris department store BHV. Shoppers queued to get into the store, while protesters screamed ""Shame!"" at them.

Shein has promised to co-operate fully with Paris prosecutors who are also investigating three other platforms - Temu, AliExpress and Wish. Allegations surrounding the sale of childlike sex dolls on Shein first came to light from France's anti-fraud office at the weekend. In a statement, Shein said it had already temporarily suspended listings from independent third-party vendors in its marketplace, while it tightened up rules on how they operate. ""This suspension enables us to strengthen accountability and ensure every product meets our standards and legal obligations,"" said Quentin Ruffat, the company's head of public affairs in France. BHV's decision to house the fast-fashion giant has angered rival clothing brands and a number have said they will leave the prestigious department store in protest. Protests against the opening continued inside the store, and one person let off a foul-smelling spray.

Shein has become best known for its discounted and trendy clothes, but has drawn criticism over its environmental impact and working conditions. Fashion designer Agnès B said earlier she would close her concession in BHV when her contract ended in January. ""I'm completely against this fast-fashion... there are jobs under threat, it's very bad,"" she told French radio. Shein spokesman Quentin Ruffat earlier promised to provide information on sellers, buyers and products involved in selling the childlike sex dolls on its site. AliExpress told the BBC it took the matter very seriously. Temu said it was not involved in the case and did not allow the sale of such items on its platform, although it told the BBC it was working with French authorities ""to reinforce our minor protection mechanism"". Wish has also been contacted for comment. Frédéric Merlin, whose SGM company runs BHV, has admitted that he considered ending the department store's partnership with the retailer. However, he said Shein's response had ""convinced me to continue"" and he expressed confidence in the products it was going to sell in his store. ""The clothes we're going to sell do not exploit workers or children,"" he told French radio.",2025-11-14T17:16:26.419247

Professor Fei-fei Li is being honoured for her pioneering contributions to the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI)

They are being recognised for their contributions to the development of modern machine learning, a field that underpins the rapid advancement of AI.

Those honoured alongside her are Prof Yoshua Bengio, Dr Bill Dally, Dr Geoffrey Hinton, Prof John Hopfield, Nvidia founder Jensen Huang and Meta's chief AI scientist Dr Yann LeCun.

The King will present the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering to Prof Li and six others during a ceremony at St James's Palace.

The 'godmother' of AI, Professor Fei-Fei Li has told the BBC that being the only woman amongst seven pioneers of artificial intelligence being presented with a top engineering prize by the King today makes her ""proud to be different"".

Who are the godparents of AI?

Dr Hinton, Prof Bengio and Yann LeCun, currently chief AI scientist at Meta have widely been recognised as the ""godfathers of AI"" since they were jointly awarded the 2018 Turing Award.

There is however only one so-called ""godmother"" of AI and Prof Li told the BBC she has grown to accept the moniker.

""I would not call myself godmother of anything,"" she said.

She said a few years ago when people started calling her that, she had to ""pause and recognise if I rejected this, it would miss an opportunity for women scientists and technologists to be recognised this way"".

""Because men are pretty easily called godfathers or founding fathers.""

""For all the young women I work with and the generations of girls to come, I'm okay now accepting this title,"" she added.

Born in China, Prof Li emigrated to the US as a teenager and went on to excel in computer science. She is co-director for Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute and co-founder and CEO of World Labs.

It is her work on ImageNet a project which enabled major advances in computer vision for which she is recognised.

She and her students created large-scale image recognition datasets upon which a lot of artificial intelligence technology is now built. It paved the way for computer vision – working out how computers could 'see'.

She says the importance of that data set ""open the floodgate of data-driven AI"".

She thinks the next AI milestone will come when it is able to interact with the world around it.

This ability was is ""innately important and native to animals and humans"", and if this could be unlocked in AI, it could ""superpower"" humans in many ways, ""including creativity, robotic learning, design and architecture"".

This will be the first time all seven laureates have come together in person.

The three ""godfathers"" have publicly stated opposing views on how dangerous AI could be.

Dr Hinton has repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the potential for AI to pose an ""extinction-level threat"". But Prof LeCun, who also works at Meta has written that apocalyptic warnings are overblown.

Prof Li says she takes a more ""pragmatic approach"" and says the disagreement amongst scientists is ""healthy"".

""We're used to even disagreement, and I think that's healthy. A topic as profound and impactful as AI requires a lot of healthy debate and public discourse.

""I think in the case of AI, both extreme rhetorics concern me…I have always advocated for a much more science based, pragmatic method in communicating and educating the public.

""So, yes, I would like to see our communication of AI to be much more moderated and grounded in facts and science instead of the extreme rhetorics"".

The Queen Elizabeth prize is awarded annually to engineers responsible for groundbreaking innovations which globally benefit humanity. Previous recipients include Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web.

Lord Vallance, chair of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation, said the winners ""represent the very best of engineering,"" adding that their work ""demonstrates how engineering can both sustain our planet and transform the way we live and learn.""

Messaging services Discord and WhatsApp and gaming platforms Lego Play and Roblox will not be included, nor will Google Classroom and YouTube Kids. Federal Communications Minister Anika Wells said the online platforms can target children with ""chilling control"" and the ban was about protecting children. ""We aren't chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference,"" she said. It is unclear how companies will implement the ban - which is being closely watched by global leaders - but some of the potential methods include using official ID documents, parental approval and facial recognition technology.

OpenAI has signed a $38bn (£29bn) contract with Amazon to access its cloud computing infrastructure, as the start-up continues its run of major partnerships to secure computing power. In 2025, the ChatGPT maker has signed deals worth more than $1tn with Oracle, Broadcom, AMD and chip-making giant Nvidia. Its latest deal reduces its reliance on Microsoft. As part of the seven-year agreement, OpenAI will gain access to Nvidia graphics processors to train its artificial intelligence models. The deal follows a sweeping restructure of OpenAI last week which saw it convert away from being a non-profit and changed its relationship with Microsoft to give OpenAI more operational and financial freedom.

""Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,"" said OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman. ""Our partnership with AWS [Amazon Web Services] strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone."" The deal reflects the massive demand for computer power coming from the growing interest in AI - and OpenAI's rush to secure the power it needs. OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, had been reliant on Microsoft for computing power for years. The two firms had an exclusive cloud agreement until January of this year, when their relationship loosened. The AI start-up's first agreement with Amazon's AWS marks its latest shift away from Microsoft toward diversified sources of computing power. ""The deal with AWS shows that OpenAI considers that its path to leadership is paved with getting access to as much computing power as it can get its hands on,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. Microsoft ""taking less of a control stake in the company has allowed relationships with near competitors to OpenAI's funders possible,"" she added. But OpenAI has been unprofitable, as spends big to get ahead in the development of AI technology. Quarterly results from Microsoft last week indicated that OpenAI lost $12bn in just the last quarter. Following the announcement of the deal on Monday, Amazon shares hit an all-time high, adding $140bn (£106bn) to its valuation.

The government has asked the media regulator to revisit its rules on phone companies raising their prices in the middle of a contract, after O2 unexpectedly announced it was raising prices by £2.50 a month. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said O2's higher than expected price increase is ""disappointing given the current pressures on consumers"". ""I believe we need to go further, faster. I am keen that we look at in-contract price rises again,"" she wrote in a letter to the media regulator. Ofcom said it shared the government's concern that ""customers who face price rises must be treated fairly by mobile providers"".

O2 said in a statement: ""We appreciate that price changes are never welcome, but we have been fully transparent with our customers about this change, writing directly to them and providing the right to exit without penalty if they wish."" Ofcom has been given until 7 November to respond to Ms Kendall's letter, and said it would respond to her specific questions shortly. In January, new rules came in which cracked down on phone and broadband providers increasing prices in the middle of a contract without warning. However, last week O2 announced it would be raising its monthly prices by more than originally promised. It was able to do this because the increase was not linked to inflation, and it has given customers 30 days to leave without penalty - so long as they continue paying off the cost of their device. The company said it has not gone against the regulation and Ofcom's rules do not stop providers from raising prices. ""A price increase equivalent to 8p per day is greatly outweighed by the £700m we invest each year into our mobile network, with UK consumers benefitting from an extremely competitive market and some of the lowest prices compared to international peers,"" it said.

Trump was asked about the pardon during an interview with CBS News' 60 Minutes programme, which was broadcast on Sunday.

US President Donald Trump says he does not know who Changpeng Zhao is, despite pardoning the cryptocurrency multi-billionaire last month.

The host of 60 Minutes, Norah O'Donnell, asked Trump why he pardoned Zhao even though government prosecutors had said he caused ""significant harm to US national security.""

""Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is,"" the president said.

Trump added that he did not recall meeting Zhao and had ""no idea who he is"", only that he had been told that the businessman was a victim of a ""witch hunt"" by the administration of former US President Joe Biden.

During the interview, Trump also discussed his support for cryptocurrencies and said that the US had to make sure it was a leader in the industry or risk China and its rivals gaining an advantage in the emerging technology.

CBS News is the BBC's US news partner.

The president's pardon lifts restrictions that had stopped Zhao from running financial ventures, but it is unclear whether it changes his standing with US regulators or his role at Binance.

At the time of the pardon, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Zhao's prosecution under the Biden administration part of a ""war on cryptocurrency"", pushing back on critics who said the pardon appeared motivated by Trump's personal financial interests.

""This was an overly prosecuted case by the Biden administration,"" she said, adding that the case had been ""thoroughly reviewed"". ""So the president wants to correct this overreach of the Biden administration's misjustice and he exercised his constitutional authority to do so.""

The Binance platform remains the most used crypto exchange in the world for trading digital assets.

The Trump administration previously halted a fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, after his investments in the Trump family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.

In May, it was announced that a stablecoin launched by World Liberty Financial would be used by an Abu Dhabi firm for a $2bn (£1.52bn) investment in Binance.

Trump has also pardoned founders of the crypto exchange BitMEX, who faced charges related to money laundering, and Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road, the dark web marketplace known as a place for drug trade.",2025-11-14T17:16:35.829632

Getty Images Fire resistant materials can buy time for fire fighters

I'm peering into a large vat containing a perfectly clear liquid – a special kind of flame retardant for wood products. ""You can drink it. I have,"" says Stephen McCann, general & technical manager at Halt, a wood treatment company in Belfast. ""I wouldn't recommend it,"" he adds, however. It's very salty, apparently. But this liquid, containing a substance called Burnblock, has been shown to prevent fire taking hold of wood in tests. In a video the firm has shared online, two small model houses are blasted with a blow torch. One, treated with a different product, is engulfed in flames to such an extent that it collapses. The Burnblock-treated model gets heavily charred in one corner but remains otherwise unharmed. What is Burnblock exactly? No-one will say. Neither Mr McCann nor Hroar Bay-Smidt, chief executive of Burnblock itself, a Danish firm, will confirm the ingredients. However, documentation on Burnblock's website from the Danish Technological Institute states the flame retardant ingredient is ""a natural component in the body"" and that the mixture also contains citric acid and ""a natural component in some berries"". Flame retardants, chemicals added to products to try and slow down how they burn, have been around in various forms for centuries. But many of the flame retardants developed in the 20th Century are highly toxic. ""There hasn't been a lot of investment in replacements so now all of a sudden people are scrambling to find them,"" says Alex Morgan, a chemist and flame retardant expert at the University of Dayton Research Institute in the US. When you try to set fire to wood treated with Burnblock, the material forms a protective layer of char, explains Mr Bay-Smidt. ""It also releases some water,"" he adds. ""That helps absorb the heat and slows the fire's spread."" And, it prevents oxygen feeding the flames. You can add Burnblock to other building materials, he says, including dried seagrass.

Halt, which has been operating in Belfast for nearly four years, has supplied Burnblock-treated wood products to hundreds of locations around the UK and Ireland. From restaurants to hotels and even HS2. For the latter, Halt provided treated hoardings used to fence off construction areas in tunnels. ""It could be quite difficult to get out of the tunnel so they need as much time as possible to evacuate [in the event of a fire],"" says Mr McCann. I ask whether any of the buildings or facilities constructed with wood treated by Halt have ever been affected by a fire to date – ""No"" is the answer.

Halt exposes wood to a vacuum, pressure and a flame retardant fluid

In one of Halt's buildings they have a huge machine called an autoclave, consisting mainly of two large horizontal tubes. The top one is a tank containing the treatment fluid that I saw earlier. When the tube below it is loaded with pieces of wood, it first exposes them to a vacuum, to open up the wood's pores, says Mr McCann. Then, pressure appropriate to the species of wood in question is applied, along with the treatment fluid. ""What that pressure is doing is, it's forcing the fire retardant into the very core of the timber,"" says Mr McCann. After this, the wood goes into a large kiln where it is dried in a process that can last anywhere from 10 days to six weeks. It's carefully managed – drying that happens too quickly or too slowly can warp the wood. ""Timber is an amazing material,"" says Richard Hull, professor emeritus and fire retardants expert at the University of Lancashire. He refers to wood's ability to take up treatment fluids within its pores. ""You can ultimately change the chemistry of its burning behaviour,"" he says. Hull is often sceptical of new flame retardants, however. He points out that some ideas have come and gone. ""There was a lot of work done on clay nanocomposites in the early 2000s,"" he says. ""Now, 20-25 years later, essentially 99% of that has fizzled out.""

University of Dayton Research Institute There's a scramble to find new flame retardant chemicals says Alex Morgan

While timber tends to burn at a fixed rate, making plastic flame resistant is another story because plastics tend to burn at an accelerating rate, he explains. Dr Morgan adds that he calls polyethylene, a type of plastic commonly used in construction, ""solid gasoline"" because of its similar chemical structure and capacity to burn rapidly. In Australia, First Graphene says it has found a way to slow the spread of fire in plastics by adding graphene – tiny flakes of carbon atoms arranged in honeycomb lattices. Michael Bell, managing director and chief executive, says the firm's solution, PureGRAPH, has already been added to products including protective footwear and conveyor belts used in the mining industry. First Graphene says it works by forming a protective gas barrier, preventing the release of volatile compounds prior to ignition, and also a char layer should ignition occur. But graphene is a notoriously enigmatic material and the company says there may be other mechanisms at work, which are not yet fully understood. Could graphene affect people's health following a fire? A spokeswoman says, ""There's no data suggesting that graphene poses any health hazards. The industry continues to test and evaluate these aspects.""",2025-11-14T17:16:53.971851

AFP via Getty Images Diesel locomotives are being replaced with electric models

Every day, thousands of passengers heading south west on trains leaving Aldershot station pass a cluster of solar panels nestled by the tracks. Few, if any, may notice the installation. But the train they are on is drawing power from it. ""On a sunny afternoon, if you are catching a train through Aldershot, a little bit of the energy for that train will come from those solar panels,"" says Leo Murray, co-founder and chief executive of Riding Sunbeams, a start-up aiming to use renewable energy resources for rail electrification projects. Riding Sunbeams built the Aldershot array in 2019 . It's small in scale at just 40 kilowatts – equivalent to roughly 10 of the rooftop solar arrays you would find on a typical British home. But it demonstrates how renewables can feed directly in to the railways. Not only that, Mr Murray says it is currently the only solar array in the country that delivers power directly to rail to move trains. ""If you are a railway, this is the cheapest electricity you can buy,"" he adds.

Around the country, and the world, many trains still run on diesel – a fossil fuel. To go electric, rail operators have traditionally had two options: electrified rail, or overhead lines that that trains connect to with arm-like pantographs on their roofs. Installing either of these systems can be expensive and technically challenging. But engineers are working on new ways of implementing such technologies and completely different alternatives are also emerging, which could speed up electrification projects. A key barrier to electrification is often the limitations of the local electricity grid – it's hard to get access to a big connection for powering your trains. ""That problem has only become much, much worse,"" says Mr Murray. This is why he views solar panels as so useful in enabling railway electrification projects. Mr Murray says that, after the Aldershot project, he had hoped Riding Sunbeams would go on to build a full-scale commercial pilot. But funding problems got in the way. Now, however, Network Rail, which owns and maintains railway infrastructure in Great Britain, is seeking suppliers for rail-side renewables projects. ""This is the big one,"" says Mr Murray, explaining that his business is planning to bid for a contract.

Riding Sunbeams Leo Murray would like to see more solar panels next to railway tracks

New projects bring new complexities, however. At Aldershot, the track was already electrified – it was a case of plugging solar panels in to that existing system. But for trains that are switching off diesel and moving over to overhead lines, leveraging solar is harder. This is because solar panels produce direct current (DC) electricity whereas overhead lines use alternating current (AC). Efforts are underway in England to develop a new converter device that could solve this problem, though. Separately, Colton Junction between Leeds and York, the fastest railway junction in the UK – where trains speed through at up to 125mph – was electrified recently with the help of software developed at the University of Huddersfield. The software makes a 3D model of the overhead line system, allowing engineers to plan its construction in minute detail – lowering costs by removing the need for certain forms of traditional testing and evaluation. ""Everything was specified in the software in terms of measurements,"" says João Pombo, associate director of the university's Institute of Railway Research. ""All the trains are running at maximum speed at that junction since August.""

Nevomo Poland's Nevomo has developed an electromagnetic propulsion system

But there are completely different ideas for electrification out there. Polish start-up Nevomo has developed an electromagnetic propulsion system. It's retrofitted onto existing track by fitting a thick aluminium cable into an enclosure that runs between the rails. This generates a magnetic field strong enough to propel freight wagons fitted with magnets. ""We eliminate locomotives completely,"" says Ben Paczek, founder and chief executive. ""Each wagon becomes independent. They can also operate in groups."" A key benefit of the technology, says Mr Paczek, is that it allows operators to bring freight wagons to a stop very quickly – and, as a consequence, that means they could, in principle, safely put lots of independently moving wagons relatively close together on one stretch of rail, increasing the density of freight transportation in a particular area. Nevomo hopes to launch working implementations of its technology at a steel plant in Bremen, Germany, and at a port in India next year. These will be relatively small in scale, each covering track distances of less than 1km (0.6 miles). But Mr Paczek hopes to see bigger installations in the future. ""In a quite conservative environment like rail, we need to demonstrate it properly first."" It would be possible to automate the motion of electromagnetically-propelled wagons, he adds – though initially they will be controlled remotely by human operators.

Getty Images There's no shortage of plastic to recycle

In the plastic recycling industry, the casualties keep coming. Waste management company Biffa's Sunderland plant closed in February after opening in 2022 at a cost of £7m, while rival Viridor closed its Avonmouth plant in 2022, Skelmersdale in 2023 and confirmed this summer that its Rochester plant would close, too. Like falling dominoes, plastic recycling plant closures have been endemic across Europe too: another big name, Veolia, will close its two German operations this year, while seven plastic recyclers closed in the Netherlands last year. Meanwhile, companies Borealis, Dow and Neste have all dropped plans to construct new plastic recycling plants in Europe. Industry body Plastic Recyclers Europe equates this to the loss of nearly one million tonnes of plastic recycling capacity since 2023. ""Without decisive political action, Europe will replace its recycling industry with dependency on unsustainable imports and growing volumes of waste, undermining both its economic resilience and its climate leadership,"" the organisation told the BBC in a statement. And more closures are likely, warns James McLeary, managing director for Biffa's polymers division, as the industry here and in Europe faces its most challenging year yet. High energy and labour costs here are two factors, in parallel with the fact that sourcing virgin and recycled plastic from Asia is currently cheaper than buying European recycled plastic. Plastic recycling plant closures are affecting the US as well, also prompted by the low price of virgin plastic, causing the country to miss its recycled content targets, as S&P Global reports. ""There's a big global dependence building on Asian plants, and we then have the situation where (plant operators in the UK and Europe) are going to make very tough decisions. Either they run their plants at a point where they're literally not making anything, or they decide to close,"" explains Mr McLeary, who is based in County Durham.

Getty Images The UK alone exports hundreds of thousands of tonnes of plastic waste

A dependence on exporting plastic waste also hasn't helped. The UK exported around 600,000 tonnes of plastic waste last year, according to environmental analysts at ENDS Report - 5% more than in 2023. Loopholes in current UK legislation mean plastic waste collectors are inadvertently incentivised to export rather than process domestically. Meanwhile, manufacturers using plastic packaging are still inclined to use cheaper virgin plastic from abroad, and stomach being taxed for it. Ahmed Detta, CEO and founder of plastic waste recycler Enviroo, is frustrated by the flaws and contradictions that he feels are plaguing the industry and disrupting the goal of creating a circular economy that keeps materials in use for as long as possible. ""For me, a circular economy is a win-win. Every single person in that journey has to have some benefit, and that's not working,"" says Mr Detta, who is based in London. ""Brands aren't aligning with the circular economy. They're saying, 'why should I buy recycled material when it's cheaper for me to pay the fine for the plastics packaging tax, than actually pay for recycled materials? No one is saying, 'let's unite'.""

Biffa It's tough for UK based recyclers to make money

So concerned is RECOUP, a UK-based plastic recycling independent authority, that its head of policy and infrastructure, Steve Morgan, warns: ""We are almost witnessing the demise of plastic recycling as we know it, unless we have some interventions. There's no way a lot of recyclers in the UK can compete."" UK regulations have benefited foreign markets more than they have the UK, and serious reform is needed, Mr Morgan argues. ""There are an awful lot of fantastic technologies developing. But it's a scale up of those and how they can actually make money, to continue to exist and then also thrive, is the secondary thing,"" says Mr Morgan, who is based in Peterborough. ""The commercial viability long term is just not there at the moment. There are some really good people producing technologies that we couldn't even dream of 10 years ago. But I just feel we're not going to see any real change in the next two to three years without some intervention."" RECOUP is urging the UK government to introduce a single plastic recycling certification scheme aimed at reducing the export of plastic waste and making more companies more inclined to use recycled packaging. Mr Morgan is optimistic that a UK government consultation this year will seriously consider what changes should be implemented to save the plastic recycling industry.

Plastics Europe Europe is in danger of falling behind in plastic recycling says Virginia Janssens

Packaging reforms are indeed being implemented, alongside £10bn of investment in new plastic sorting and processing facilities, according to a spokesperson from the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). They also say the Deposit Return Scheme, launching in October 2027, will create higher quality material for recycling, as consumers will be encouraged to return drinks bottles and cans to collection points to collect the small deposit they will have paid on purchase. The government has also convened a Circular Economy Taskforce. ""Our collection and packaging reforms will support UK-based recycling, meaning we can reduce our dependency on exports of plastic waste,"" says the spokesperson. ""The export of waste is subject to strict controls set out in UK legislation."" Over in Brussels, Virginia Janssens is the managing director at Plastics Europe, which represents plastic producers, including those with recycling operations and that use recycled materials. She's concerned that the plastic recycling industry is set to flourish outside Europe. ""Business will go where it makes sense and where it's cheapest to build. If those big production plans are built somewhere else, with huge investments of billions, they're not all of a sudden then going to decide to go back and build one in Europe,"" says Ms Janssens. ""It will have a huge effect on our value chain. It would set us back to 20 years ago, when we would have to incinerate or use landfill more, and that would be a real shame. Nobody wants this.""",2025-11-14T17:16:58.720863

Corbis via Getty Images Battery health is a top priority for buyers of used EVs

When Kerry Dunstan and his partner set out to buy a new electric car this summer, one of the questions they asked was, ""How's the battery?"". They'd found a 2021 Nissan Leaf with just 29,000 miles on it, and the dealer told them the condition of the battery, or its state of health (SOH), was still around 93%. The couple were sold. For £12,500, they got an EV with a big boot and plenty of room for passengers. Though Mr Dunstan, a cabinetmaker who also owns a somewhat snazzier electric Volvo SUV, hasn't quite fallen in love with the aging Leaf. ""I like sporty, jazzy cars – and it's just a bit 'meh',"" he says. However, he adds the Leaf has performed exactly as expected during the three months they've owned it.

It used to be that age and mileage were the two headline details pored over by would-be buyers of second-hand cars. But as more people shift to electric, scrutinising the health of a car's battery has become arguably even more important. How has that battery been treated? Did the last owner regularly fast charge it to 100%, for example? That has the potential to shorten an EV battery's lifespan. This battery black box problem has put some consumers off buying a second-hand EV. But battery analytics firms say they can reveal the condition of an old EV's battery with high accuracy. And industry experts say some EVs are lasting longer than many predicted. Take Mr Dunstan's Nissan Leaf. This is a model of EV built without the kind of sophisticated, liquid-based battery cooling system common to many other EVs. While Nissan has rectified this in the latest generation of Leafs, earlier models show a considerable shortening of their range year by year, according to data analysed by US insurance and research firm NimbleFins. Mr Dunstan is unfazed. ""I charge both my EVs to 100% and I put them on charge when I need to charge them – I don't worry about it,"" he says.

Kerry Dunstan The performance of Kerry Dunstan's used EV has met his expectations

For people in the market for a second-hand EV who are plagued by battery anxieties, however, Austria-based firm Aviloo says it has a solution. ""We really can, completely independently, determine the state of health of a battery,"" says chief product officer, Patrick Schabus. Aviloo is one of several battery analytics businesses in the market. The company, which provides battery health certificates for major UK outlet British Car Auctions, offers two products. There's a premium test, where EV owners plug a data logging box roughly the size of a glasses case into their car so that it can monitor battery performance while they use the car over a few days, going from 100% charge down to 10%. Or, they can opt for a quicker flash test, which uses a different box to suck up data from the car's battery management software and then analyse it with the help of a computer model. ""We can do this at a standstill in under two minutes,"" says Mr Schabus. The premium test observes battery discharge closely, picking up fluctuations in current or voltage, and can reveal extra detailed information about the health of individual cells in the battery, says Aviloo. Marcus Berger, Aviloo's chief executive, says his company's analytics results sometimes diverge ""substantially"" from the battery SOH percentages produced by some cars' own built-in analytics systems. He challenges conventional wisdom that batteries with an SOH below 80% are too far gone: ""An EV with a state of health below 80% can still be a great car… It just needs to be priced [appropriately].""

In New Zealand, EV owner Lucy Hawcroft, who works in a sustainability role for an infrastructure firm, bought a Nissan Leaf with her husband roughly three years ago. She recalls getting an SOH result of 95% or so from the dealership. But a year later an independent mechanic checked the SOH again for them. ""It dropped quite a bit,"" she recalls. ""My husband was a bit surprised, or concerned, about that."" However, the car still has a range of around 160km (100 miles) when fully charged. The pair mostly use it for short journeys of up to 10km. Mrs Hawcroft says she has friends whose EVs have much bigger ranges, of around 400km: ""That would be ideal."" For David Smith, sales director at Cleevely Electric Vehicles in Cheltenham, being able to analyse used EVs' batteries in detail is a deal-maker. Most customers ask for this information, he says. His company uses SOH reports from ClearWatt, another battery analytics firm. ""They're completely independent. We can't interfere with the reports,"" he says. ""Once customers have seen the report, that aids the sale nine times out of 10."" Matt Cleevely, managing director at Cleevely Electric Vehicles, adds that it's often possible to replace groups of cells or modules within a battery pack – far cheaper than installing a whole new battery.

NextWealth Tamil Nadu hosts ancient temples and AI developers

India has long been a centre for outsourced IT support, with cities like Bangalore or Chennai being traditional hubs for such work. But in recent years firms have been moving that work into much more remote areas, where costs for staff and space are lower. The trend is know as cloud farming, and AI has given it another boost with numerous smaller towns hosting firms working on AI. Mohan Kumar is one worker who has benefited from that. He lives in the small town of TN Palayam, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. ""My role is in AI annotation. I collect data from various sources, label it, and train AI models so they can recognize and predict objects. Over time, the models become semi-supervised and can make decisions on their own,"" he says. So does Mr Kumar think he is missing out, by not being in a big city? ""Professionally, there is no real difference. Whether in small towns or metros, we work with the same global clients from the US and Europe, and the training and skills required are the same,"" says Mr Kumar.

Mohan Kumar Mohan Kumar prepares data used to train AI models

Mr Kumar works for Desicrew, which is headquartered in Chennai. Founded in 2005 it was a pioneer in cloud farming. ""We realised that instead of forcing people to migrate to cities in search of jobs, we could bring jobs to where people already live,"" says Mannivannan J K, the chief executive of Desicrew . ""For too long, opportunities have been concentrated in cities, leaving rural youth behind. Our mission has always been to create world-class careers closer to home, while proving that quality work can be delivered from anywhere."" Desicrew does all sorts of outsourced work including software testing for start-up firms, building datasets to train AI, and moderating content. At the moment 30 to 40% of its work is AI related, ""but very soon, it will grow to 75 to 100%,"" says Mr J K. Much of that work is transcription - turning audio to text. ""Machines understand text far better,"" he explains. ""For AI to work naturally, machines must be trained to understand variations in how people speak. That's why transcription is such a crucial step, it forms the foundation for machines to comprehend and respond across languages, dialects, and contexts."" Doing such work in a smaller town is not a disadvantage, Mr J K says. ""People often assume rural means underdeveloped, but our centres mirror urban IT hubs in every way – secure data access, reliable connectivity, and uninterrupted power. The only difference is geography. "" Around 70% of his workforce are women: ""For many, this is their first salaried job, and the impact on their families is transformative – from financial security to education for their children,"" says Mr J K.

NextWealth Around 60% of NextWealth staff are women

Founded in 2008, NextWealth was also an early mover in cloud farming. Headquartered in Bangalore, it employs 5,000 staff in 11 offices in smaller towns across India. ""Sixty percent of India's graduates come from small towns, but most IT companies hire only from the metros. That leaves behind a huge untapped pool of smart, first-generation graduates,"" says Mythily Ramesh, co-founder and managing director of NextWealth. ""Many of these students are first-generation graduates. Their parents are farmers, weavers, tailors, policemen - families who take loans to fund their education,"" she says. NextWealth started with outsourced work from the back offices of big companies, but five years ago moved into artificial intelligence. ""The world's most advanced algorithms are being trained and validated in India's small towns,"" says Ms Ramesh. Around 70% of its work comes from the US. ""Every AI model, from a ChatGPT-like system to facial recognition, needs vast amounts of human-labelled data. That is the backbone of cloud-farming jobs."" She thinks there is plenty more work to come. ""In the next 3–5 years, AI and GenAI will create close to 100 million jobs in training, validation, and real-time handling. India's small towns can be the backbone of this workforce."" She is hopeful that India can remain a hub for such work. ""Countries like the Philippines may catch up, but India's scale and early start in AI sourcing gives us a five to seven-year advantage. We must leverage it before the gap narrows,"" she says.

KS Viswanathan is a technology advisor, and formerly worked at India's National Association of Software and Service Companies, the trade association for outsourcing firms. ""Silicon Valley may be building the AI engines, but the day-to-day work that keeps those engines reliable increasingly comes from India's cloud farming industry,"" he says. ""We are truly at a tipping point. If cloud farming continues to scale, small-town India could well become the world's largest hub for AI operations, just as it became the hub for IT services two decades ago."" But success is not guaranteed. While NextWealth and Desicrew both say they have access to reliable and secure internet connections, Mr Viswanathan says that is not always the case in India's smaller towns. ""Reliable high-speed internet and secure data centres are not always at par with metros, which makes data protection a constant concern."" Even if good connections are in place, work needs to be done to reassure clients. ""The bigger challenge is the perception rather than a technical one. International clients often assume small towns cannot meet data security standards, even when the systems are robust. Trust has to be earned through delivery.""",2025-11-14T17:17:01.866120

Several months ago Andie started playing around with a fitness app. It recommended that she substantially increase her protein intake. The hard part for her was doing so without also increasing calories. ""So I started trying to find high-protein alternatives to things I was already consuming,"" she explains. This included yogurt, milk, coffee, cereal and pasta. ""I realized that everything tasted pretty much the same to me, and I started then actively seeking these products."" So she was excited when a Canadian restaurant chain introduced high-protein lattes earlier this year. Andie, who did not want to give her surname, drinks them without sweetener, and describes it as a ""decent"" product. Is it a more expensive diet? Living in Vancouver, Andie says prices are already quite high. ""High protein is usually a couple of dollars extra, so it's not a big difference."" Like Andie, you may have noticed on supermarket shelves and restaurant menus a high-protein craze sweeping the food sector. Surveys show consumers increasingly care about the protein content of their food. In the US between March 2024 and March 2025, there was 4.8% volume growth in sales of products labelling themselves as protein-rich, compared to the previous year, according to research group NielsenIQ.

Milk has been one beneficiary of the protein craze. Last year saw the first increase in milk consumption since 2009, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture. That's partly being attributed to the enthusiasm for protein. The so-called back-to-cow movement includes products like bovine colostrum, the protein-rich milk cows produce soon after giving birth. The protein trend has been especially driven by the expanded availability of protein from whey, typically a by-product of cheese production. Whey protein is a billion-dollar sector that continues to grow.

While dairy is doing well, plant-based alternatives to dairy products are going through some lean times. The sales volume of milk alternatives has started to decline, mainly driven by lower consumption in the Americas. Almond milk especially is losing market share. Slowing sales are reflected in slowing chatter online. While US searches for ""oat milk"" outnumbered Google searches for ""whole milk"" in 2020, in 2025, that has reversed. People are searching more for various types of cow milk now than ever before. One reason is the perceived naturalness of foods from cows, including collagen and beef tallow. According to NielsenIQ, milk's global market value is almost eight times larger than that of milk alternatives ($69.3bn; £50.8bn, compared with $8.4bn; £6.2bn). Milk's market value is also growing much faster. Plant-based manufacturers are responding to the demand for high-protein drinks by mentioning protein more on their packaging, and reformulating their products to include more protein.

Serena Bolton Federica Amati says the popularity of high-protein foods is down to marketing

Nutritionists are often frustrated by the fervour over protein. They point out again and again that most residents of rich countries already consume more protein than they need. The exceptions may be for certain groups, including the severely malnourished, the elderly, women going through menopause, and people with chronic inflammatory conditions. Federica Amati is a research fellow at the School of Public Health at Imperial College London. She is also the head nutritionist for the nutrition company Zoe. Dr Amati worries that ""people are being hoodwinked into thinking 'high protein' on a label necessarily means that it is healthy. Honestly, it's another health halo."" While excess consumption of protein is not likely to harm most people's health, ""consuming more protein than your body can use during midlife is linked to an increased risk of multiple diseases, including cancer,"" Dr Amati warns. ""An important point on this, though, is that plant-based sources of protein don't seem to increase cancer risk."" And because most people don't have unlimited money to spend on food, high-protein products could be an unhelpful distraction. ""The price of fresh whole foods is going up so shoppers are best off buying more whole foods, and the standard already high-whey natural Greek yogurt without the markup,"" Dr Amati comments. ""And remember, most of us can get plenty of the protein we need if we're eating enough whole foods."" If anything should be seen as a hero nutrient, according to many nutritionists, it should be fibre rather than protein. Dr Amati believes: ""The popularity of high-protein products in general is entirely due to marketing. Manufacturers can easily [and cheaply] add extra protein to their products and whack the price up.""

Verley Stéphane Mac Millan wants the dairy industry to ""move into the 21st century""

Businesses are responding to that demand. At French start-up Verley a gleaming row of stainless steel tanks, called fermentors, hold special microorganisms being fed on sugars. Eventually they'll produce beta-lactoglobulin, a protein found in whey. The team at Verley, a French startup, will then purify the protein, including extracting the lactose. The end result is a high-protein powder that is essentially dairy, but which Verley says is suitable for vegans as no cows are involved. The process is both traditional and cutting-edge, believes Stéphane Mac Millan, Verley's CEO. On the one hand, fermentation has a long history in French food culture, including in cheesemaking. On the other hand, Verley wants to modernise dairy by honing the nutritional benefits while reducing the environmental impacts. Dairy production requires large amounts of water and land, while generating large amounts of greenhouse gases. ""A goal really is to help the dairy industry move into the 21st century,"" Mr Mac Millan says. Mr Mac Millan is betting that nutrition-conscious consumers will care increasingly not only about getting enough whey protein, but about getting specific forms of it. He says that some US consumers are now seeking out beta-lactoglobulin, which is high in the amino acid leucine, rather than non-specific whey protein. The increasing number of people using weight-loss injections could also help drive the company's growth, Mr Mac Millan believes. People concerned about rapidly losing muscle might reach for high-protein products. He acknowledges that Verley's protein will be more expensive than whey protein initially. ""But considering that we are bringing more to the table and we are sustainable, it's normal that there is a premium."" The company is also hoping to bring costs down with greater scale. It is currently seeking regulatory approval in various countries.",2025-11-14T17:17:03.479109

Earlier this year, Rachel wanted to clear the air with a man she had been dating before seeing him again in a wider friendship group setting. ""I'd used ChatGPT for job searching but had heard someone else use it [for dating advice],"" says Rachel, who does not want her real name used, and lives in Sheffield. ""I was feeling quite distressed and wanted guidance, and didn't want friends involved."" Before the phone call, she turned to ChatGPT for help. ""I asked, how do I deal with this conversation but not be on the defensive."" Its response? ""ChatGPT does this all the time but it was something like 'wow, that's such a self-aware question, you must be emotionally mature going through this. Here are some tips'. It was like a cheerleader on my side, like I was right and he was wrong."" Overall, she says it was ""useful"" but described the language as ""very much like therapy speak, using words like 'boundaries'"". ""All I took from it was it reminded me to be OK to do it on my terms, but I didn't take it too literally.""

Rachel is not alone in turning to AI for advice in dealing with relationships. According to research by the online dating firm Match, almost half of Generation Z Americans (those born between 1997 and 2012) said they have used LLMs like ChatGPT for dating advice, that's more than any other generation. Which generation are you? People are turning to AI to help craft breakup messages, to dissect conversations they're having with people they're dating, and to resolve problems in relationships.

Anastasia Jobson Using AI might be a tactic to avoid difficult feelings says Dr Suglani

Dr Lalitaa Suglani, psychologist and relationship expert, says AI can be a useful tool, especially for people who feel overwhelmed or unsure when it comes to communication in relationships. It may help them to craft a text, process a confusing message or source a second opinion, which can offer a moment of pause instead of being reactive, she says. ""In many ways it can function like a journalling prompt or reflective space, which can be supportive when used as a tool and not a replacement for connection,"" says Dr Suglani. However, she flags several concerns. ""LLMs are trained to be helpful and agreeable and repeat back what you are sharing, so they may subtly validate dysfunctional patterns or echo back assumptions, especially if the prompt is biased and the problem with this it can reinforce distorted narratives or avoidance tendencies."" For example, she says, using AI to write a breakup text might be a way to avoid the discomfort of the situation. That might contribute to avoidant behaviours, as the individual is not sitting with how they actually feel. Using AI might also inhibit their own development. ""If someone turns to an LLM every time they're unsure how to respond or feel emotionally exposed, they might start outsourcing their intuition, emotional language, and sense of relational self,"" says Dr Suglani. She also notes that AI messages can be emotionally sterile and make communication feel scripted, which can be unnerving to receive.

Es Lee Not everyone can talk to friends and family about relationships says Es Lee

Despite the challenges, services are springing up to serve the market for relationship advice. Mei is a free AI generated service. Trained using Open AI, the service responds to relationship dilemmas with conversational-like responses. ""The idea is to allow people to instantly seek help to navigate relationships because not everyone can talk to friends or family for fear of judgment,"" says New York-based founder Es Lee. He says more than half of the issues brought up on the AI tool concern sex, a subject that many may not wish to discuss with friends or a therapist, Mr Lee says. ""People are only using AI as existing services are lacking,"" he says. Another common use is how to reword a message or how to fix an issue in a relationship. ""It's like people need AI to validate it [the problem].""

When giving relationship advice, issues of safety could come up. A human counsellor would know when to intervene and protect a client from a potentially harmful situation. Would a relationship app provide the same guardrails? Mr Lee recognises the concern over safety. ""I think the stakes are higher with AI because it can connect with us on a personal level the way no other technology has."" But he says Mei has ""guardrails"" built into the AI. ""We welcome professionals and organisations to partner with us and take an active role in molding our AI products,"" he says. OpenAI the creator of ChatGPT says that its latest model has shown improvements in areas like avoiding unhealthy levels of emotional reliance and sycophancy. In a statement the company said: ""People sometimes turn to ChatGPT in sensitive moments, so we want to make sure it responds appropriately, guided by experts. This includes directing people to professional help when appropriate, strengthening our safeguards in how our models respond to sensitive requests and nudging for breaks during long sessions.""

Another area of concern is privacy. Such apps could potentially collect very sensitive data, which could be devastating if exposed by hackers. Mr Lee says ""at every fork in the road on how we handle user privacy, we choose the one that preserves privacy and collects only what we need to provide the best service."" As part of that policy, he says that Mei does not ask for information that would identify an individual, other than an email address. Mr Lee also says conversations are saved temporarily for quality assurance but discarded after 30 days. ""They are not currently saved permanently to any database.""",2025-11-14T17:17:05.039800

Getty Images E. coli has been used in many discoveries in genetics and molecular biology

Earlier this year an extraordinary new way of using waste plastic made headlines. A common bacterium was genetically engineered to eat a plastic-derived molecule and then digest it to produce the everyday painkiller, paracetamol. The microbe used by Stephen Wallace, professor of chemical biotechnology at the University of Edinburgh, was Escherichia coli, better known as E. coli. The rod-shaped bacterium is found in the intestines of humans and animals, and you might be more familiar with it as an unpleasant bug that can make us ill. Prof Wallace chose it automatically because certain strains of E. coli that aren't pathogenic are used extensively in biotechnology and engineering biology laboratories to test whether something might work. E. coli is the field's main ""workhorse"" says Prof Wallace, who has also genetically engineered it in the lab to turn plastic waste into vanilla flavour and fatberg waste from sewers into perfume. ""If you want to prove something is possible with biology, E.coli is a natural first stage,"" he says. The microbe's use isn't just confined to the lab. Industrially, vats of genetically engineered E. coli act like living factories producing a variety of products from pharmaceuticals like insulin, vital for diabetes management, to various platform chemicals used to make fuels and solvents.

University of Edinburgh Prof Wallace has engineered E.coli to produce vanilla flavour and perfume

But how did E. coli come to be such a mainstay of biotechnology, why is it so useful and what might its future hold? E. coli's dominance stems from its role as a model organism for understanding general biological principles, says Thomas Silhavy, a professor of molecular biologist at Princeton University, who has been performing studies in the bacterium for about 50 years and has documented its history. Other familiar model organisms include mice, fruit flies and baker's yeast. Yeast, like E. coli, has also become an invaluable tool in biotechnology, both in the lab and industrially – but it has a more complex cell structure and different applications. E. coli was first isolated in 1885 by a German paediatrician, Theodor Escherich, studying infant gut microbes. Fast growing and easy to work with, scientists began to use it to study basic bacterial biology. Then in the 1940s, ""serendipity"" catapulted it into the big time, says Prof Silhavy. A non-pathogenic E. coli strain (K-12) was used to demonstrate bacteria did not just divide, but could undergo 'bacterial sex' where they share and recombine genes to gain new traits. It was a landmark discovery and E. coli became the ""very favourite organism of everybody"", he says. It saw E. coli go on to play a central role in many more discoveries and milestones in genetics and molecular biology. It was used to help decipher the genetic code, and in the 1970s it became the first organism to be genetically engineered when foreign DNA was inserted into it – laying the foundation for modern biotechnology.

It also solved a problem with insulin production. Insulin from cattle and pigs had been used to treat diabetes, but caused allergic reactions in some patients. But in 1978 the first synthetic human insulin was produced using E. coli, a huge breakthrough. In 1997, it became one of the first organisms to have its entire genome sequenced, making it easier to understand and manipulate. Adam Feist, a professor at the University of California, San Diego who evolves microbes for industrial applications, says he appreciates E. coli for its many useful features. Beyond the vast knowledge accumulated about its genetics and the tools that make it easy to engineer, the bacterium grows quickly and predictably on a wide variety of substrates. It isn't ""finicky"" like some, can be frozen and revived without trouble, and is unusually good at hosting foreign DNA. ""The more I work with more microorganisms, the more I appreciate just how robust E. coli is,"" he says. Cynthia Collins is a senior director at Ginkgo Bioworks, a company that helps firms develop their biotech products, and has assisted them in using E. coli industrially. While the menu of organisms available for large-scale manufacturing is somewhat broader than it was a few decades ago – when E. coli was often the only choice – it can frequently still be a ""good choice"" depending on the product, says Dr Collins. (Even with the most intensive bioengineering, E. coli can't produce everything). ""It's very economical; you can pump out a lot,"" she says, noting that if the bacterium is producing something toxic to the cells, tolerance can often be engineered in.

Yet there are some who wonder if E. coli's dominance might be stifling us from finding the very best biotech solutions for our problems. Paul Jensen, a microbiologist and engineer at the University of Michigan, studies bacteria that live in our mouths. He recently analysed just how understudied most other bacteria have been relative to E. coli. His point is while we are forging ahead with ever more extensive engineering of E. coli to do remarkable things, there could be other microbes out there that do those things naturally – and better – that aren't getting a look in and we are missing out on benefitting from because they aren't being sought out or studied. Bioprospecting in landfills, for example, might turn up microbes that have started eating not only plastic but all sorts of other waste, he says. And there could be bacteria out there that do things – like making cement or rubber – we haven't even imagined. Just the bacteria that live in our mouths outshine E. coli for acid tolerance he notes. ""We are just so deep with E. coli that we are not investigating enough,"" he says.",2025-11-14T17:17:06.601187

Getty Images AI services need a lot of computing power

It's such a big number that it's hard to imagine. Worldwide, around $3tn (£2.2tn) will be spent on data centres that support AI between now and 2029. That estimate comes from the investment bank Morgan Stanley, which adds that roughly half of that sum will go on construction costs, and half on the pricey hardware supporting the AI revolution. To put that number into perspective, that's roughly what the entire French economy was worth in 2024. In the UK alone, it's estimated that another 100 data centres will be built over the next few years to meet the demand for AI processing. Some of those will be built for Microsoft which earlier this month announced $30bn (£22bn) investment in the UK's AI sector. Just what is it about AI data centres that's different from the traditional building containing ranks of computer servers that keeps our personal photos, social media accounts and work applications humming away? And are they worth this terrific spending spree? Data centres have been growing in size for years. A new term, hyperscale, was coined by the tech industry to describe sites where the power requirement runs into tens of megawatts, before gigawatts, a thousand times bigger than megawatts, came on the scene.

But AI has supercharged this game. Most AI models rely on expensive computer chips from Nvidia to process tasks. Nvidia chips come in large cabinets costing around $4m each. And these cabinets hold the key to why AI data centres are different. The Large Language Models (LLMs) that train up AI software have to break language into every possible tiny element of meaning. That is only possible with a network of computers working in unison and in extremely close proximity. Why is proximity so important? Every metre of distance between two chips adds a nanosecond, one billionth of a second, to the processing time. It might not sound like much time, but when a warehouse full of computers is whirring away these microscopic delays pile up and dilute the performance needed for AI. The AI processing cabinets are jammed in together to eliminate this element of latency and create what the tech sector calls parallel processing, operating as one enormous computer. It all spells out density, a magic word in AI construction circles. Density eliminates the processing bottlenecks that regular data centres see from working with processors sitting several metres apart.

Bloomberg via Getty Images Google is among the giants racing to build AI infrastructure

However, those dense ranks of cabinets eat up gigawatts of power and LLM training produces spikes in that appetite for electricity. These spikes are equivalent to thousands of homes switching kettles on and off in unison every few seconds. This type of irregular demand on a local grid needs to be carefully managed. Daniel Bizo of data centre engineering consultancy The Uptime Institute analyses data centres for a living. ""Normal data centres are a steady hum in the background compared to the demand an AI workload makes on the grid."" Just like those synchronised kettles, sudden AI surges present what Mr Bizo calls a singular problem. ""The singular workload at this scale is unheard of,"" says Mr Bizo, ""it's such an extreme engineering challenge, it's like the Apollo programme."" Data centre operators are getting around the energy problem in various ways. Speaking to the BBC earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that in the UK in the short term he was hoping that more gas turbines could be used ""off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid"". He said AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost effective sustainable energy. Microsoft is investing billions of dollars in energy projects, including a deal with Constellation Energy that will see nuclear power produced again on Three Mile Island. Google, owned by Alphabet, is also investing in nuclear power as part of a strategy to run on carbon-free energy by 2030. Meanwhile Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is part of the retail giant Amazon, says it is already the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world.

An aviation rarity touched down in the Norway's second city of Bergen earlier this month. Alia had flown 100 miles (160km) in 55 minutes on battery power alone. Built by US aerospace company Beta Technologies, the electric plane is designed for cargo operations - carrying up to 560kg (half a tonne) loads. The flight had simulated a planned cargo route between the coastal cities of Stavanger and Bergen, and for the next few months test-flights will be carried out, as part of the country's move towards establishing low-emission aviation. At the helm was pilot Jeremy Degagne, ""If you do the drive, it's four and a half hours. And we did the flight in 52 minutes."" ""It is an important milestone for Norway as an international test arena,"" says Karianne Helland Strand, a director at Norwegian airport operator, Avinor. The test-flights in Norway follow a whirlwind European tour, which kicked off in Ireland, and saw Alia debut at the Farnborough and Paris Air Shows, as well as making stops in Germany and Denmark.

Beta Technologies Alia has a range of 400km

Alia can fly up to 400km (250 miles) on a single charge, and refuel in less than 40 minutes by plugging-in, just like an electric car. The same fixed-wing model can be configured for medical transport or passenger travel with up to five seats, and this June it undertook the first electric demonstration flight carrying passengers into New York's JFK airport. Beta, which counts Amazon as an investor and UPS as a customer, hopes to get US certification for its plane this year. ""I'm convinced that the next major breakthrough in aerospace will come on the back of electric propulsion,"" says Beta's chief revenue officer Shawn Hall, who's a former fighter pilot. ""We're now able to significantly lower the operating cost and it's environmentally beneficial from a carbon perspective.""

Alia is one of the most advanced projects, among dozens of firms exploring electric propulsion in aviation. It would be one way of reducing the aviation industry's carbon footprint - which currently accounts for 3% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Pipistrel Velis Electro remains the only electric plane to receive full certification from European authorities, despite clearing that hurdle five years ago. With a range of 185km and 50 minutes of flight time, the Slovenian-built Pipistrel is limited to training and not for shuttling passengers from A to B. But successes like that have been overshadowed by a string of failures in electric aviation. Even aviation giant Airbus has backed away from the market. In January it announced that development of its CityAirbus electric aircraft would be put on hold.

Airbus Development of the CityAirbus is on hold

Range remains the major limitation to electric flight. Even the best lithium ion batteries are bulky and heavy, with much lower energy density than jet fuel. They have ""not improved significantly"" over the past two decades, reckons Guy Gratton, an aviation expert and professor at Cranfield University. For electric flight to take-off, a ""revolution"" in battery chemistry is needed, he says. Given those limitations, some are looking at alternative technology. Just as hybrid cars were a stepping stone towards electric vehicles; plane-makers are now also experimenting with hybrid technology. Among the aviation start-ups trying to get electric passenger planes off the ground, is Heart Aerospace. It recently shifted its entire operations from Sweden to the US, which its management said would help it focus ""resources"" and be closer to clients, including the airlines Mesa and United. The firm has developed a 30-seater, prototype plane, the X1, which the BBC saw before it was shipped to the United States. If all goes to plan during upcoming test-flights, it will become the largest battery-powered plane to fly. ""It has about two tons of batteries in it,"" explained chief technology officer Benjamin Stabler.

Heart Aerospace Heart plans a hybrid plane that can switch between batteries and jet fuel

For its real-world operations, though, Heart is adopting a fundamentally different design: a hybrid plane, powered by batteries, but carrying fuel as backup. ""You don't need as [many] batteries,"" argues Mr Stabler, which makes it lighter and cheaper, and also allows for more paying passengers. ""For a normal route, it would fly all-electric from takeoff to landing,"" he explained. ""If you want to go a longer distance, or if there's a diversion, you can switch over to the turbines."" The aircraft could travel 200km in electric-only flight. With the hybrid technology, which is scheduled for test-flights in 2026, it could fly 400km with 30 passengers, or up to 800km with 25, the firm claims. ""Public transport flying, quite rightly, requires a significant amount of energy reserve,"" says Prof Grattan. ""So hybridisation and the use of conventional fuels to carry safety reserves makes good sense,"" adds the professor, who has previously advocated this approach.

Heart isn't alone in this field. US-based aerospace startup Electra expects its nine-seater hybrid plane to take flight by 2029, running on a combination of jet fuel and electric power. Beta Technologies is also pursuing hybrid aircraft for defence and civilian purposes. Its first model was built in 2023, and later this year it plans to produce a plane that is not only hybrid but autonomous. ""Are we excited about hybrid? 100%,"" says Mr Hall. ""It's a way to get longer ranges, today, and you still get a lot of the environmental benefit."" A fully electric foundation is necessary first argues Mr Hall, ""you then layer on hybrid technology"". Hybrid systems have lower emissions than conventional aircraft and the electric motors would enable quieter take off and landing in urban areas.",2025-11-14T17:17:09.886306

Anja-Sara Lahady AI has become an assistant for Anja-Sara Lahady

Like most people, when Anja-Sara Lahady used to check or research anything online, she would always turn to Google. But since the rise of AI, the lawyer and legal technology consultant says her preferences have changed - she now turns to large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. ""For example, I'll ask it how I should decorate my room, or what outfit I should wear,"" says Ms Lahady, who lives in Montreal, Canada. ""Or, I have three things in the fridge, what should I make? I don't want to spend 30 minutes thinking about these admin tasks. These aren't my expertise; they make me more fatigued."" Ms Lahady says her usage of LLMs overtook Google Search in the past year when they became more powerful for what she needed. ""I've always been an early adopter… and in the past year have started using ChatGPT for just about everything. It's become a second assistant."" While she says she won't use LLMs for legal tasks - ""anything that needs legal reasoning"" - she uses it in a professional capacity for any work that she describes as ""low risk"", for example, drafting an email. ""I also use it to help write code or find the best accounting software for my business.""

Ms Lahady is not alone. A growing number are heading straight for LLMs, such as ChatGPT, for recommendations and to answer everyday questions. ChatGPT attracts more than 800 million weekly active users, up from 400 million in February 2025, according to Demandsage, a data and research firm. Traditional search engines like Google and Microsoft's Bing still dominate the market for search. But LLMs are growing fast. According to research firm Datos, in July 5.99% of search on desktop browsers went to LLMs, that's more than double the figure from a year earlier.

Getty Images ChatGPT attracts around 800 million weekly users

Professor Feng Li, associate dean for research and innovation at Bayes Business School in London, says people are using LLMs because they lower the ""cognitive load"" - the amount of mental effort required to process and act on information – compared to search. ""Instead of juggling 10 links with search, you get a brief synthesis that you can edit and iterate in plain English,"" he says. ""LLMs are particularly useful for summarising long documents, first-pass drafting, coding snippets, and 'what-if' exploration."" However, he says outputs still require verification before use, as hallucinations and factual errors remain common.

While the use of AI might have exploded, Google denies that it is at the expense of its search engine. It says overall queries and commercial queries continued to grow year-over-year and its new AI tools significantly contributed to this increase in usage. Those new tools include AI Mode, which allows users to ask more conversational questions and receive more tailored responses in return. That followed the rollout of AI Overviews, which produces summaries of queries at the top of the search page. While Google plays down the impact of LLMs on its search business, an indication of the affect came in May during testimony in an antitrust trial bought by the US Department of Justice against Google. A top Apple executive said that the number of Google searches on Apple devices, via its browser Safari, fell for the first time in more than 20 years. Nevertheless, Prof Li doesn't believe there will be a replacement of search but a hybrid model will exist. ""LLM usage is growing, but so far it remains a minority behaviour compared with traditional search. It is likely to continue to grow but stabilise somewhere, when people primarily use LLMs for some tasks and search for others such as transactions like shopping and making bookings, and verification purposes.""

Getty Images Apple says Google searches on Apple devices via the Safari browser are falling

As a result of the rise of LLMs, companies are having to change their marketing strategies. They need to understand ""which sources the model considers authoritative within their category,"" says Leila Seith Hassan, chief data officer at digital marketing agency Digitas UK. ""For example, in UK beauty we saw news outlets and review sites like Vogue and Sephora referenced heavily, whereas in the US there was more emphasis on content from brands' own websites."" She says that LLMs place more trust in official websites, press releases, established media, and recognised industry rankings than in social media posts. And that could be important, as Ms Seith Hassan says there are signs that people who have used AI to search for a product, are more likely to buy. ""Referrals coming directly from LLMs often appear to be higher quality, with people are more likely to convert to sales.""",2025-11-14T17:17:11.500210

Getty Images Newspapers are banking on online revenue to replace falling circulation

When actress Sorcha Cusack left the BBC drama Father Brown in January, it made headlines, including for the newspapers owned by Reach, among them The Mirror, and the Daily Express. But the story did not generate the traction the Reach newspapers would have expected a year ago, or even at the start of the year. Reach put this down to AI Overviews (AIO) – the AI summary at the top of the Google results page. Instead of clicking through to the story on a Reach newspaper site, readers were happy with the AI overview. The feature is a concern for newspapers and other media publishers, who have already seen much of their advertising revenue siphoned off by social media. In a tough market, readers coming via Google search is a valuable source of traffic. ""A major worry, backed by some individual datapoints, has been that AI overviews would lead to fewer people clicking through to the content behind them, with negative knock-on effects for publishers,"" says Dr Felix Simon, research fellow in AI and news at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford. He points out that it's hard to know the full effect of AI overviews, without independent access to Google's, or publishers', internal data on click-through rates.

DMG Media, owner of MailOnline, Metro and other outlets, said AIO resulted in a fall in click-through-rates by as much as 89%, in a statement to the Competition and Markets Authority made in July. It means publishers are not being fairly rewarded for their work, says David Higgerson, chief digital publisher at Reach. ""Publishers provide the accurate, timely, trustworthy content that basically fuels Google, and in return we get a click… that hopefully we can monetise to our subscription service. ""Now with Google Overviews it's reducing the need for somebody to click through to us in the first place, but for no financial benefit for the publisher."" ""It's another example of the distributor of information not being the creator of information but taking all the financial reward for it."" There is also concern over Google's new tool called AI Mode, which shows search results in a conversational style with far fewer links than traditional search. ""If Google flips onto full AI Mode, and there is a big uptake in that…that [will be] completely quite devastating for the industry,"" says Mr Higgerson.

Getty Images The Daily Mail has one of the UK's biggest online news operations

""We are definitely moving into the era of lower clicks and lower referral traffic for publishers,"" says Stuart Forrest, global director of SEO digital publishing at Bauer Media. ""For most of the last decade Google has introduced more and more features into the SERP [Search Engine Results Page], which reduces the need for consumers to visit a website. That is the challenge that we as a sector face."" Mr Forrest says he hasn't noticed a drop in traffic across Bauer's sites, which include brands Grazia and Empire, as a result of the overview feature. But that could change. ""I absolutely think that as time goes on, as consumers get used to these panels, it's without doubt going to be a challenge. We are absolutely behaving as if we have to respond to that threat.""

In its defence, a Google spokesperson said: ""More than any other company, Google prioritises sending traffic to the web, and we continue to send billions of clicks to websites every day. In an August blog post, Google's head of search Liz Reid said the volume of clicks from Google search to websites had been ""relatively stable"" year-over-year. She also said the number of quality of clicks had improved slightly compared to a year ago - quality clicks are when a user does not immediately click back from the link. ""With AI Overviews, people are searching more and asking new questions that are often longer and more complex. In addition, with AI Overviews people are seeing more links on the page than before. More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked,"" she said in the blog.

Publishers are trying to work out how to appear in Google summaries

Some in the publishing industry are turning to the courts for redress. In July, a group of organisations including the Independent Publishers Alliance, tech justice non-profit Foxglove, and the campaign group Movement for an Open Web filed a legal complaint to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority alleging that Google AI Overviews is using publishers' content at a cost to the newspapers. It is asking the CMA to introduce interim measures to prevent Google from ""misusing"" publisher content in AI-generated responses.",2025-11-14T17:17:13.108916

Boston Metal Making steel using electricity is less carbon intensive than traditional methods

A day care centre for children, a gym, a tax advisor – and a mini experimental steel plant. These businesses are among those that make up a small retail and industrial estate in the city of Woburn, Massachusetts. ""People are dropping off their kids. That kind of shows you an extreme example of what the future of steel looks like,"" says Adam Rauwerdink, vice president of business development at US-based green steel start-up, Boston Metal. ""You can be making steel and sharing a parking lot with a daycare."" Boston Metal has come up with a way of using electricity to remove oxides and other contaminants from iron ore, which is the substance you have to mine from the Earth before you can make new steel. The process involves distributing the ore within an electrolyte and then using electricity to heat this mixture to 1,600C. Molten iron then separates from impurities and can be tapped off. Traditionally, extracting that all-important iron from ores requires blast furnaces that run on fossil fuels. But the iron and steel industry are responsible for 11% of global emissions – a huge amount, equivalent to all the world's private cars and vans – and so now a race is on to find greener ways of producing these important metals.

US companies are, arguably, at the forefront. Steelmaking in the US is already greener than in many countries, thanks to the popularity of electric arc furnaces there. These furnaces use electricity, not heat from burning fossil fuels, to melt scrap steel – for example – and recycle it. Plus, a handful of emerging start-ups such as Boston Metal say they can go one better and use electricity for the iron-making process, a crucial step in making brand new, or virgin, steel. However, the Trump administration has taken a less than enthusiastic stance towards renewable energy and decarbonisation projects. It remains to be seen whether these new start-ups will make a big, molten splash in the steel industry any time soon. Switching from traditional blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces can lower carbon emissions per tonne of steel produced from 2.32 tonnes of CO2 to 0.67 tonnes of CO2. For iron-making, some plants could use green hydrogen – made using electricity from 100% renewable sources – says Simon Nicholas, lead steel analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. But switching iron and steel-making plants over to green hydrogen hasn't gone as smoothly as some had expected. In June, Cleveland-Cliffs, a major US steel producer, appeared to back away from its plans to build a $500m (£375m) hydrogen-powered steel plant in Ohio. The BBC has contacted Cleveland-Cliffs for comment. ""We're seeing projects cancelled, proponents pulling out of projects all over the place,"" says Mr Nicholas, of green hydrogen initiatives, specifically.

Bloomberg via Getty Images Electric arc furnaces melt scrap to make new rolls of steel

Plus, there is a limit to how much steel-making can rely on electric arc furnaces since they currently largely rely on a supply of scrap steel. A relatively low supply of scrap steel in China, versus demand, has slowed the rollout of electric arc furnaces there, according to some analyses. These headaches would suggest that there is a niche for companies developing alternative ways of making iron and steel. Boston Metal is one. ""It looks a lot like how we make iron and steel today – it's a lot easier to conceive how that would get to scale [as a result],"" says Paul Kempler, an expert in electrochemistry and electrochemical engineering at the University of Oregon. However, he notes that there are still challenges in ensuring that electrolysis systems like this don't corrode too quickly over time. Boston Metal says it hopes to have its first demonstration-scale steel plant operational by 2028.

Electra Steel collected on a plate at Electra's plant in Colorado

Separately, the US firm Electra is taking a different approach to producing highly purified iron from ores. Unlike Boston Metal, Electra's process runs at a relatively low temperature, around 60-100C. First, iron ore is dissolved into an acidic solution and then an electrical charge causes the iron to collect onto metal plates. This is similar to the process currently used for making sheets of copper and zinc today. ""These plates are extracted automatically out of the solution and the iron is harvested,"" says Sandeep Nijhawan, co-founder and chief executive. A demonstration plant in Colorado, which could produce 500 tonnes of iron annually, is currently set to open next year. Initially, iron produced in this manner would cost more than iron made using traditional techniques. But that ""green premium"" could fall away should the company be able to scale sufficiently, says Mr Nijhawan.

Eddie Hart Eddie Hart says coding firms seem reluctant to hire recent graduates

Eddie Hart studied computer science and cybersecurity at Newcastle University, graduating in 2024. He says he knew getting into the tech workforce would be a challenge, but ""I thought it would be a little easier"". Even when ""junior"" roles were advertised, they often demanded two or more years professional experience, Mr Hart says. ""It's not realistic, and it's just discouraging the good candidates from even trying."" To him it seems clear that potential employers are using AI tools to automate the simpler parts of coder's work, tasks which would traditionally allow newcomers to build up experience. While companies undoubtedly benefit from using AI in some parts of their operations, says Mr Hart, ""I don't think replacing developers entirely with AI is sustainable.""

ChatGPT, and other coding tools, are being blamed for a collapse in tech job openings, particularly for younger software developers and engineers. A report by the UK's National Foundation for Education Research showed a 50% decline in tech job adverts between 2019/20 and 2024/25, with entry level roles particularly affected. The report cited the ""anticipated impact of artificial intelligence"" as one of the factors behind this. At the same time, software developers have widely adopted AI code tools, while simultaneously expressing distrust in their output. Research by Stack Overflow, a software knowledge platform, shows almost half use AI tools daily, despite just one third actually trusting the output of such tools. Prashanth Chandrasekar, CEO of Stack Overflow, says it's ""a tricky time to graduate"". More broadly, he says, its research shows developers are choosing to stay put, despite many expressing dissatisfaction with their work. ""People are probably running for safety a little bit."" All of this means young technologists are finding it harder to get that critical first job.

Stack Overflow ""It's a tricky time to graduate,"" says Prashanth Chandrasekar

The stress of finding a job is also being raised by the use of AI in the job application process. Mr Hart came across one highly automated application process which had eight stages, the first of which was to answer 20 exam-style questions about himself. Such exercises can take up hours of time. Friends had been asked to record and upload answers to interview style questions. ""And then that's just reviewed by AI and a computer makes the decision. It just feels like you don't get that respect of at least being rejected by a human,"" he says.

Colin, who didn't want his full name to be used, studied computer science at university, graduating in 2024. He spent almost a year working through the recruitment process for one large company – only to be ultimately unsuccessful. Even smaller firms often use AI to screen applications, he says, meaning CVs have to structured to be ""AI friendly"". Colin would then find he was being interviewed by people ""who have clearly not read my CV"". Both Mr Hart and Colin said they knew the senior roles were still out there. But, they wondered, who will fill them if younger developers like them were unable to secure jobs.

Paul Dix, CTO and co-founder at California-based database firm, InfluxData says in any economic downturn or disruption, junior software developers were the ones who got hit hardest. But he says, ""If nobody's hiring younger developers, then you're going to arrive at this point where you don't have senior developers either, because you've completely killed your pipeline."" More positively says Rajiv Ramaswami, CEO of US enterprise cloud firm Nutanix, ""Some of these younger folks coming out of college actually have more experience using AI tooling compared to traditional ways of programming."" Ramaswami adds: ""I find the market for talent to be the best we've seen in several years."" Mr Chandrasekar says the industry had always had an ""apprenticeship"" type model, with a pipeline of young people coming in and working with senior developers. And, he suggests, executives and companies that had invested heavily in AI tech are under pressure to show some return on that investment. Even if that was by simply cutting back on hiring.",2025-11-14T17:17:16.664407

374Water 374Water can purge PFAS from water and sludge

""There's a lot of destruction that needs to be done,"" sums up Parker Bovée of Cleantech Group, a research and consulting firm. He is referring to PFAS (Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances), also known as ""forever chemicals"". These man-made chemicals can be found in items such as waterproof clothing, non-stick pans, lipsticks and food packaging. They are used for their grease and water repellence, but do not degrade quickly and have been linked to health issues such as higher risks of certain cancers and reproductive problems. The extraordinarily strong carbon-fluorine bonds they contain gives them the ability to persist for decades or even centuries in nature. PFAS can be detected and removed from water and soil and then concentrated into smaller volumes of high strength waste. But what to do with that waste? Currently, concentrated PFAS waste is either put in long-term storage which is expensive, or incinerated (often incompletely, leading to toxic emissions), or sent to landfills for hazardous waste. But now clean-tech companies are bringing techniques to market that can destroy them. These are being tested in small-scale pilot projects with potential customers including some industrial manufacturers, municipal wastewater treatment plants and even the US military.

There's a ""large and growing"" market opportunity for PFAS destruction companies notes Mr Bovée. While it is mostly currently centred in the US, others are dipping their toes, he says. In the UK, funding for water companies to look into PFAS destruction has been provided by water regulator Ofwat, with Severn Trent Water leading a project to examine the potential technologies and suppliers. One factor driving the market forward in the US is legal risk. Thousands of lawsuits claiming PFAS-related contamination and harm have been filed with some large chemical manufacturers, notably 3M, having already paid out billions in class-action settlements. Regulation is also beginning to tighten worldwide. Legal limits for two PFAS in drinking water are now scheduled to take effect in the US in 2031. PFAS remains a bipartisan issue, says Mr Bovée, and many expect that future US regulation will expand beyond drinking water to cover industrial discharge and other sources. The EU also has legal limits for PFAS in drinking water, which member states must begin enforcing from next year.

Axine Water Technologies Axine's system is already in use at an auto parts company

There are a variety of technologies for destroying PFAS – each with their own advantages and limitations. According to Mr Bovée, one technology that is almost commercially ready is electrochemical oxidation (EO) technology. Electrodes are placed in water contaminated by PFAS and a current is passed through, resulting in the chemicals' breakdown. While energy intensive, it doesn't require high temperature or pressure, and is easy to operate and integrate into existing treatment systems for concentrating PFAS, says Mark Ralph, CEO of Canadian-based start-up Axine Water Technologies. Last year, following a successful pilot project, it sold its first commercial-scale unit to a Michigan-based producer of automotive components. It is now up and running and the customer is planning to purchase additional systems for other sites.

374Water A waste water facility in Orlando is testing 374Water's treatment system

Another technology not far behind is Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO). It relies on heating and pressurising water to such a high degree that it enters a new state of matter: a so-called supercritical state. When the PFAS waste stream is introduced, it breaks the carbon-fluorine bonds. One advantage is that it can process both solid and liquid PFAS waste, says Chris Gannon, CEO of North Carolina-based 374Water. He says his technology can even destroy PFAS in plastics if they are ground up. It can be expensive to buy and maintain – the process is so intense it requires a complex reactor and regular cleaning. But it can be more cost effective if the PFAS is first concentrated before it enters the process. Currently the City of Orlando in Florida is testing 374Water's technology at its largest wastewater treatment plant. The City is trying to get ahead of the curve, explains Alan Oyler, its special projects manager for public works. Levels of PFAS in sewage sludge aren't currently regulated, but he expects them to be in the future. So far, Mr Oyler is pleased with the destruction capability he has seen, but is also waiting to see how reliable the system is. The scale of 374Water's current technology is small: it can handle just a fraction of the tonnes of wet sludge the facility produces daily. But the company is in the process of scaling up, and Mr Oyler imagines in a few years it will be able to handle all the facility's material ""ready for when the regulations require"".

Other technologies on their way to being commercially ready include hydrothermal alkaline treatment (HALT), which uses high temperature, high pressure, and an alkaline chemical to destroy PFAS; and plasma-based technology, which involves making an ionized gas (called a plasma) to attack and degrade the PFAS molecules.

Aquagga Aquagga destroyed PFAS in a fire-fighting foam mixture

Yet there is one potential issue with the technologies now coming through, says Jay Meegoda, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology: nasty PFAS degradation byproducts. For example, in the case of EO, highly corrosive hydrogen fluoride vapor. Each needs a ""complete study"" accounting for all their inputs and outputs, he says. The companies have claimed they either don't produce PFAS degradation products or deal with them adequately.",2025-11-14T17:17:18.315830

XYZ Films Swedish movie Watch the Skies was dubbed into English using AI

Finding international films that might appeal to the US market is an important part of the work of XYZ Films. Maxime Cottray is the chief operating officer at the Los Angeles-based independent studio. He says the US market has always been tough for foreign language films. ""It's been limited to coastal New York viewers through art house films,"" he says. It's partly a language problem. ""America is not a culture which has grown up with subtitles or dubbing like Europe has,"" he points out. But that language hurdle might be easier to clear with a new AI-driven dubbing system. The audio and video of a recent film, Watch the Skies, a Swedish sci-fi film, was fed into a digital tool called DeepEditor. It manipulates the video to make it look like actors are genuinely speaking the language the film is made into. ""The first time I saw the results of the tech two years ago I thought it was good, but having seen the latest cut, it's amazing. I'm convinced that if the average person if saw it, they wouldn't notice it - they'd assume they were speaking whatever language that is,"" says Mr Cottray. The English version of Watch The Skies was released in 110 AMC Theatres across the US in May. ""To contextualise this result, if the film were not dubbed into English, the film would never have made it into US cinemas in the first place,"" says Mr Cottray. ""US audiences were able to see a Swedish independent film that otherwise only a very niche audience would have otherwise seen."" He says that AMC plans to run more releases like this.

Flawless DeepEditor can translate a performance into a different language

DeepEditor was developed by Flawless, which is headquartered in Soho, London. Writer and director Scott Mann founded the company in 2020, having worked on films including Heist, The Tournament and Final Score. He felt that traditional dubbing techniques for the international versions of his films didn't quite match the emotional impact of the originals. ""When I worked on Heist in 2014, with a brilliant cast including Robert De Niro, and then I saw that movie translated to a different language, that's when I first realised that no wonder the movies and TV don't travel well, because the old world of dubbing really kind of changes everything about the film,"" says Mr Mann, now based in Los Angeles. ""It's all out of sync, and it's performed differently. And from a purist filmmaking perspective, a very much lower grade product is being seen by the rest of the world.""

Flawless Scott Mann founded Flawless in 2020

Flawless developed its own technology for identifying and modifying faces, based on a method first presented in a research paper in 2018. ""DeepEditor uses a combination of face detection, facial recognition, landmark detection [such as facial features] and 3D face tracking to understand the actor's appearance, physical actions and emotional performance in every shot,"" says Mr Mann. The tech can preserve actors' original performances across languages, without reshoots or re-recordings, reducing costs and time, he says. According to him, Watch the Skies was the world's first fully visually-dubbed feature film. As well as giving an actor the appearance of speaking another language, DeepEditor can also transfer a better performance from one take into another, or swap a new line of dialogue, while keeping the original performance with its emotional content intact.

Thanks to the explosion of streaming platforms such as Netflix and Apple, the global film dubbing market is set to increase from US$4bn (£3bn) in 2024 to $7.6bn by 2033, according to a report by Business Research Insights. Mr Mann won't say how much the tech costs but says it varies per project. ""I'd say it works out at about a tenth of the cost of shooting it or changing it any other way."" His customers include ""pretty much all the really big streamers"". Mr Mann believes the technology will enable films to be seen by a wider audience. ""There is an enormous amount of incredible kind of cinema and TV out there that is just never seen by English speaking folks, because many don't want to watch it with dubbing and subtitles,"" says Mr Mann. The tech isn't here to replace actors, says Mann, who says voice actors are used rather than being replaced with synthetic voices. ""What we found is that if you make the tools for the actual creatives and the artists themselves, that's the right way of doing it… they get kind of the power tools to do their art and that can feed into the finished product. That's the opposite of a lot of approaches that other tech companies have taken.""

As Bolivians prepare to vote in a general election, the country's deep economic woes are the central issue. Whoever becomes the nation's next president faces a very difficult job to try to sort out the mess. El Alto is Bolivia's second-largest city, home to 1.2 million people. And, at an elevation of 4,150m (13,615ft), it is the world's highest city with a population of more than 100,000. It's full of narrow streets with vendors trying to sell you everything from oranges to knock-off designer trainers. Standing on a pavement, car mechanic Josue Macias is enjoying an ice cream with his young son. He describes how Bolivia's sky-high inflation is affecting him and his family. The annual rate soared to 24% in June. ""Prices for everything are going up, but we are still earning the same,"" he says. ""We are just about getting by, but it's hard because food prices are rising all the time, things like meat, oil and eggs. They are double or triple what they used to be. ""We've had to tighten our belts. We don't go out to eat in restaurants anymore. Instead, I'm here on the street having an ice-cream with my son!""

Bolivia's inflation spike has been caused by a combination of factors. Falling natural gas production and therefore exports of this key foreign earner has led to a decline in overseas revenues. In turn, this has meant a shortage of US dollars, making it harder and more costly for the country to import petrol, diesel and food stuffs, leading to shortages and price hikes. It has led to street protests across the country. At some petrol stations across the country, lorry drivers often have to wait more than 24 hours to fill up. Taxi driver Gonzalo Rios is frustrated. As we drive along the pot-holed streets of La Paz, the country's administrative capital, he tells me about his struggles. ""Before it was easy to fill up with petrol. Now I must wait for around four to six hours at the gas pump to get some, and that's too much. It's such a waste of time. ""And the prices are so expensive,"" he adds. ""Now the money we earn doesn't cover our costs. But we can't put our fares up because if we do, we won't have any customers. It would be too expensive for them.""

Car mechanic Josue Macias says he can afford to buy an ice cream but not go out for a proper meal

For almost 20 years the Bolivian government kept fuel prices artificially low through subsidies. This started when the government of then President Evo Morales nationalised the country's hydrocarbon sector in 2006. But in 2023, state energy company YPFB said Bolivia was running out of domestically-produced natural gas, due to a lack of investment in new exploration. Without this gas to export, the Bolivian government is struggling to continue to find the funds to subsidise petrol and diesel. Last year it spent $2bn (£1.5bn) on such subsidies, according to a recent statement by a former minister of hydrocarbons and energy. Outgoing left-wing President Luis Arce, who is not seeking re-election on 17 August, blamed the Bolivian parliament for the fall in natural gas production, accusing MPs of blocking vital oversea loans. His opponents in turn blame him for the economic turmoil. The official exchange rate of Bolivia's currency, the bolivianos, is certainly not helping matters. Since 2011 the government has fixed the exchange rate at 6.96 bolivianos to one US dollar. But unofficially you can get 14 to 15 bolivianos per dollar. This has led to a thriving black market, especially of exports, from which the government misses out on tax revenue. Economist Gary Rodriguez, the general manager for the Bolivian Institute of Foreign Trade, explains: ""A product that costs seven bolivianos here in Bolivia can be sold for 15 bolivianos abroad,"" he says. ""The problem is that businesses would prefer to sell items on the [overseas] black market rather than here in Bolivia which leads to food and fuel shortages.""

Restrictions on the use of credit cards is another headache for Bolivia's business community. ""The problem with the credit cards is that all the banks have limits that are ridiculous,"" says Alessandra Guglielmi, who owns a food business called The Clean Spot. ""You can [only] spend around $35 a month over the internet with online purchases. $35 is nothing for a business."" She is concerned about her business going under. ""I am worried with food prices going up I can't afford to pay my staff a decent salary,"" says Ms Guglielmi. ""I am worried about the people not being able to afford to buy my products because I must put the prices up. ""And I am worried because my margins have gone down so it's very hard right now for me to keep a business.""

Many people in Bolivia are hoping that a new government will be able to turn the country's fortunes around. Two right-wing candidates are currently ahead in the polls for the presidential race. Leading is Samuel Doria Medina of National Unity Front. He was previously the main shareholder of Bolivia's largest cement manufacturer. In second place is Jorge Quiroga of Freedom and Democracy. He has been president of Bolivia before, from 2001 to 2002. If no candidate gets more than half the votes on 17 August – which no-one is expected to achieve - then there will be a second round of voting on 19 October. Bolivian political scientist and analyst Franklin Pareja is sceptical that the next administration will be able to improve most people's lives.

Priti Gupta Translation tech has made work easier for Vineet Sawant

Vineet Sawant has spent the last two years navigating the streets of Mumbai on a scooter as a delivery driver. ""Being on the road is always very stressful and especially in cities like Mumbai,"" he says. But when he started out language barriers were an additional problem. His first language is Marathi and Mr Sawant speaks ""very little"" English. ""I can understand but it's very difficult to read,"" he explains. That caused problems at his new job. He said: ""At first, it was difficult. Everything was in English, and I can understand some of it, but I'm more comfortable in Marathi. I used to ask other delivery guys to help me figure out what to do."" His employer, Zepto, promises ""India's Fastest Online Grocery Delivery"". So having drivers struggling with delivery instructions was not ideal. To smooth this process a year ago, Zepto partnered with Reverie Language Technologies to introduce an AI translation service for its drivers. Since then its delivery drivers have been able to choose between six languages on the Zepto app. ""I don't have to guess anymore,"" says Mr Sawant. ""Earlier I would take more time to read and sometimes even made mistakes. Now if the customer writes 'ring bell', I get that instruction in Marathi. So, I don't have to ask or check again. It's all clear.""

Getty Images India has 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects

Mr Sawant's difficulties are common. ""India has 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects,"" says Professor Pushpak Bhattacharyya, from IIT Mumbai, one of India's leading experts in the use of AI in Indian languages. ""Without tech, that understands and speaks these languages, millions are excluded from the digital revolution - especially in education, governance, healthcare, and banking,"" he points out. The rollout of new generative AI systems, like ChatGPT, has made the task more urgent. Vast amounts of data, like web pages, books or video transcripts are used to train an AI. In widely spoken languages like Hindi and English that is relatively easy to get, but for others it is more difficult. ""The main challenge to create Indian language models is the availability of data. I'm talking about refined data. Coarse quality data, is available. But that data is not of very high quality, it needs filtering,"" says Professor Bhattacharyya. ""The issue in India is for many Indian languages, especially tribal and regional dialects, this data simply doesn't exist or is not digitised.""

Reverie Language Technologies is now deploying its AI-driven translation technology for a range of Indian companies. Co-founder Vivekananda Pani says that while translation technology will make communication easier, there is ""potential for less common dialects to be pushed aside"". ""The challenge will be to make sure that the amazing benefits of AI-driven language advancements don't accidentally shrink the rich variety of human language.""

To help tackle the problem Professor Bhattacharyya has contributed to Bhashini, a government project to develop those high quality datasets needed to train an AI. As well as the datasets, Bhashini has built AI language models and translation services in 22 languages. Started in 2022, it's a huge undertaking, but has already made a lot of progress. Bhashini currently hosts 350 AI-based language models that have processed more than a billion tasks. More than 50 government departments work with Bhashini, as well as 25 state governments. For example Bhashini tech is used in multi-lingual chatbots for public services and to translate government schemes into local languages. ""Bhashini ensures India's linguistic and cultural representation by building India-specific AI models rather than relying on global platforms,"" says Amitabh Nag, CEO of Digital India, Bhashini Division. He hopes that within the next two or three years rural users will have voice-enabled access to government services, financial tools and information systems in their native languages.

These India-focused datasets will hopefully one day give people developing AI-based models the tools to make it much easier to adapt them for the entire population. Currently, designing any AI programme to deal with complex processes such as healthcare can be extremely challenging. Kshitij Jadhav, an associate professor at the Koita Centre for Digital Health at IIT Mumbai, is working on an AI programme which would help people quit smoking. He explains that people at different stages of the process need different advice and they usually need a well-trained human to make that assessment. But there are a limited number of practitioners who can help, particularly those that can operate in multiple languages, so Professor Jadhav is hoping his AI model can bridge the gap. The AI ""will first identify the kind of conversation the person needs and accordingly will frame questions, show empathy, emotions,"" says Professor Jadhav. And all that, hopefully, will eventually be done in 22 languages. Initial experiments are underway in English and Hindi.

UK government borrowing costs have risen sharply in reaction to news that the chancellor has decided against increasing income tax rates in the upcoming Budget. The interest rate on 10-year government bonds, known as the yield, jumped from 4.44% to 4.56% in early trading, indicating the cost to government if it chose to borrow over this length of time. The spike in yields reflected concern in the financial markets about how the government would meet its spending and borrowing commitments without an income tax rise. But yields eased slightly later following news that the financial hole facing the government was going to be less than experts have been predicting.

The BBC understands the chancellor has not moved forward with a widely-reported proposal to increase income tax rates by 2p, while cutting National Insurance by the same amount, after receiving a better-than-expected forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The manifesto-breaching measure would have raised several billion pounds, and was sent to the OBR as an option earlier this month to be costed, to help fill what was then a £30bn gap in the public finances, mainly caused by a downgrade to productivity. But more recent assessments from the OBR appear to have increased the projected strength of wages and tax receipts in the coming years and offset several billion pounds of that gap, taking it closer to £20bn.

Gilt markets reacted strongly on Friday morning to a Financial Times report that the chancellor was dropping the tax plan, but the markets eased slightly following news of the improved OBR forecast. By mid-afternoon, gilt yields were hovering around 4.53%. Ruth Curtice, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation - the think tank which first proposed the idea of raising income tax by 2p and cutting National Insurance by the same amount - said the latest Budget rumours risked exacerbating market movements. ""It is normal for economic forecasts and policies to change in the run up to the Budget. It is not normal for so much of that to be laid bare in public,"" she said. ""The market moves this morning and in recent weeks suggest a serious look should be taken at the approach to market-sensitive forecast information."" Oxford Economics' chief UK economist Andrew Goodwin said the episode showed the Budget would be a test of the market's confidence in the government's approach to finances. ""Smaller tax rises to tackle an apparently smaller problem aren't a good idea if markets don't believe the OBR's forecast is credible,"" he said. He noted the OBR's forecasts have ""consistently been too optimistic about growth, and if those forecasts were not fixed it would be ""risky"" for the chancellor to pin all Budget plans on them. ""There's a good chance that markets would conclude the problems aren't resolved and the government will be back in the same situation at the next fiscal event."" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We do not comment on speculation around changes to tax outside of fiscal events. The Chancellor will deliver a Budget that takes the fair choices to build strong foundations to secure Britain's future.""",2025-11-14T17:17:25.422946

The change comes as the retailer has experienced solid growth, despite uncertainty generated by new tariffs and signs of slowing consumer spending.

He will be succeeded by John Furner, a Walmart lifer who worked his way up from the shop floor and now serves as head of the company's US business.

The 59-year-old is stepping down after more than a decade at the helm of the world's largest retailer, a period when it successfully expanded its online operations, while scaling back riskier international units.

Walmart chief executive Doug McMillon will retire from his post in January, handing over the reins to a longtime deputy.

Walmart chairman Greg Penner said Mr McMillon had left the company in a stronger position than when he started in the role in 2014, when the rise of e-commerce had put the firm on the defensive.

""Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and eCommerce capabilities, and modernising our supply chain, resulting in sustained, robust financial performance,"" he said in a statement announcing the plans.

Walmart, which reported roughly $670bn in revenue last year, has a sprawling global footprint, with more than 10,000 stores in 19 countries.

But under Mr McMillon, Walmart behaved like a ""small business"" - moving quickly to experiment as it worked to find its footing in the world of online retail, said Neil Saunders, managing director at consultancy GlobalData.

Success was mixed. For example, the company offloaded menswear brand Bonobos in 2023 at a loss just six years after buying it.

But online purchases now represent a key growth driver for the firm.

""I think he'll be remembered as a leader that was transformational,"" Mr Saunders said. ""He's taken a very good business and he's made it even better, which is a very difficult thing to do.""

Mr McMillon will remain an adviser to Mr Furner and continue to serve on the board of the company through June 2026 to help with the transition, the company said.

Mr McMillon said in a statement that it had been a ""great honour"" to serve as chief executive, while praising 51-year-old Mr Furner as ""uniquely capable of leading the company through this next AI-driven transformation"".

Mr Furner has been in charge of Walmart's US business since 2019, helping to steer it through the pandemic's supply chain disruptions and jump in prices that followed.

The business has also successfully weathered the abrupt changes in tariffs this year, using its scale to help keep price rises in check and make gains against competitors. Sales increased nearly 5% in the US in the most recent quarter.

He had long been floated as a likely successor to Mr McMillon.

Getty Images Advertisers are using AI to personalise online advertising

Imagine one night, you're scrolling through social media on your phone, and the ads start to look remarkably familiar. They're decked out in your favourite colours, are featuring your favourite music and the wording sounds like phrases you regularly use. Welcome to the future of advertising, which is already here thanks to AI. Advertising company Cheil UK, for example, has been working with startup Spotlight on using large language AI models to understand people's online activity, and adapt that content based on what the AI interprets an individual's personality to be. The technology can then mirror how someone talks in terms of tone, phrase and pace to change the text of an ad accordingly, and insert music and colours to match, say, whether the AI deems someone to be introverted or extroverted, or have specific preferences for loud or calm music, or light or dark colours. The aim is to show countless different ads to millions of people, all unique to them.

Brands in retail, consumer electronics, packaged goods, automotive, insurance and banking are already using the technology to create AI-enhanced, personality-driven ads to target online shoppers. The AI is able to read what people post on public platforms - Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and other public forums - as well as someone's search history, and, most importantly, what people enter into ChatGPT. Then, with what it deduces about an individual's personality, the AI overlays that on top of what advertisers already know about people. For example, what part of the country you live in, what age bracket you're in, whether you have children or not, what your hobbies might be, where you go on holiday and what clothes you like to wear - information brands can already see through platforms like Facebook or Google. That's why the jeans you've been searching online for magically appear in your inbox as a sponsored ad, or the holiday you've been searching for seems to follow you around the internet.

Cheil AI ads will attempt to discover and use your emotional state says Chris Camacho

The difference is now AI can change the content of those ads, based on what it thinks your personality is, thanks to what it's been reading about you. It targets individual people, rather than the demographic segments or personas advertisers would traditionally use. ""The shift is that we are moving away from what was collected data based on gender and age, and readily available information, to now, going more into a deeper emotional, psychological level,"" says Cheil UK CEO Chris Camacho. ""You've now got AI systems that can go in and explore your entire digital footprint - your entire online persona, from your social media interests to what you've been engaging in. ""That level is far deeper than it was previously, and that's when you start to build a picture understanding that individual, so whether they're happy, whether they're sad, or what personal situation they're going through.""

An added bonus for advertisers is that they might not even need a bespoke AI system to personalise their output. Researchers in the US studied the reactions of consumers who were advertised an iPhone, with tailored text written by ChatGPT based on how high that person scored on a list of four different personality attributes. The study found the personalised text was more persuasive than ads without personalised text - and people didn't mind that it had been written by AI. ""Right now, AI is really excelling on that targeting piece. Where it's still in nascent stages, is on that personalisation piece, where a brand is actually creating creative copy that matches some element of your psychological profile,"" explains Jacob Teeny, an assistant professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, who led the AI research. ""It still has some development to go, but all roads point to the fact that this will become the way [digital advertising is done],"" he adds. Personalised AI ads could also provide a solution to the problem of digital advertising 'wastage' - the fact that 15% of what brands spend on digital advertising goes unseen or unnoticed, so it generates no value to their business.

Alex Calder Alex Calder warns that adverts could turn into ""creepy slop""

Not everyone is convinced that personalisation is the right way to go. ""Congratulations - your AI just spent a fortune creating an ad only one person will ever see, and they've already forgotten it,"" says Brighton-based Alex Calder, chief consultant at AI innovation consultancy Jagged Edge, which is part of digital marketing company Anything is Possible. ""The real opportunity lies in using AI to deepen the relevance of powerful, mass-reach ideas, rather than fragmenting into one-to-one micro-ads that no one remembers. Creepy slop that brags about knowing your intimate details is still slop."" Ivan Mato at brand consultancy Elmwood agrees. He is also questioning whether people will accept it, whether regulators will allow it, and whether brands should even want to operate this way. ""There's also the surveillance question. All of it depends on a data economy that many consumers are increasingly uncomfortable with,"" says London-based Mr Mato. ""AI opens new creative possibilities, but the real strategic question isn't whether brands can personalise everything - it's whether they should, and what they risk losing if they do.""

Guests across the world have been told to leave their accommodation mid-holiday after property rentals firm Sonder suddenly went bankrupt. The collapse came after hotel chain Marriott terminated its leasing agreement with Sonder, a year after the partnership had been established. It allowed Sonder rooms to be booked via Marriott's various booking platforms and app. But Marriott said ""Sonder's default"" had led it to break up with the short-term rentals and serviced apartments firm. One customer on Reddit said he couldn't get back in to his room where his belongings were, while others shared pictures of themselves carting luggage through the streets, seeking rooms elsewhere.

Sonder rooms can no longer be booked via the Marriott site and app. Marriott said it was helping people who booked via its own platforms but was advising those who booked via a third party to ask for a refund via their credit card issuer. ""Sonder has faced severe financial constraints arising from, among other things, prolonged challenges in the integration of the company's systems and booking arrangements with Marriott International,"" Sonder said in a statement on its website. Seen as a rival to Airbnb, which offers alternatives to traditional hotels, Sonder focussed on premium serviced apartments and lodgings. Founded in Montreal, it operates thousands of rooms in over 40 cities, all of which will now be closing as the firm seeks insolvency proceedings in all territories it operates in. ""We are devastated to reach a point where a liquidation is the only viable path forward,"" said Janice Sears, Sonder's interim chief executive. She added its integration with Marriott was ""substantially delayed due to unexpected challenges in aligning our technology frameworks"", which she said resulted in significant costs. She said there was a sharp decline in revenue ""arising from Sonder's participation in Marriott's Bonvoy reservation system"". Marriott Bonvoy is a booking and rewards system operated by Marriott. One man said he had received no communication about his cancelled Sonder reservation, that there was no way to contact the firm online, and said it was ""causing significant worry"".

'It was a huge mess'

Rob Goodwin found himself abruptly out of work this week as a result of Sonder's collapse. Mr Goodwin, a front desk manager at the Sonder The Merchant hotel in New York City's lower Manhattan area, was trying to help a guest extend her stay on Sunday when he encountered an unexpected error in the booking system. Extension dates were no longer available, even though the hotel was only 80% full at the time. Shortly after, another guest came downstairs to the front desk and showed him an email from Marriott instructing the guest to vacate the property by the following morning, Mr Goodwin said. ""Leadership ghosted us for quite a while,"" Mr Goodwin said. He said he and his colleagues were in the dark about the situation for several hours. Mr Goodwin spent 16 hours at the Sonder property on both Sunday and Monday, to help guests figure out alternative lodging options. He said he was only paid for half of that time. ""It was a mess. It was a huge mess,"" he said, adding that most guests at his location expressed empathy for him and his colleagues. Mr Goodwin is now unemployed. But he said he is optimistic that he will find similar work though his relationships with building owners in New York City. He has an 8-year-old daughter to support, and said ""it's too expensive to be dealing with this right now"".",2025-11-14T17:17:30.439924

The National Audit Office recently said nearly all 23,000 homes that had external wall insulation installed under two separate schemes will result in damp and mould if left unaddressed

Appearing before Parliament, Jeremy Pocklington, the most senior civil servant at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, said the failures were ""unacceptable"".

Its damning report also found that hundreds of homeowners' health and safety had been put at immediate risk because the insulation work had not been done correctly.

Last month, the National Audit Office found that 98% of the 23,000 homes that had external wall insulation installed under two separate schemes will result in damp and mould if left unaddressed.

A botched net zero scheme which has caused damp issues in thousands of homes was the result of ''serious failings at every level"", a UK government official has said.

These schemes commonly used external wall insulation, which involved fixing insulation boards to the exterior brickwork and then applying render to make it waterproof. It can go wrong when water becomes trapped behind the boards.

The damage also applies to about a third of homes which had internal insulation installed under the ECO4 scheme and the Great British Insulation Scheme, available to residents in England, Scotland and Wales.

More than three million homes have been insulated under a variety of government schemes over the last 20 years. Billions of pounds of public money have been spent on it.

Appearing before the Public Accounts Committee, Mr Pocklington began his evidence session by saying his thoughts were with the families and households affected.

The chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP, said the NAO report findings were the ''worst'' he'd seen in 12 years of chairing the committee and accused the department of negligence.

Mr Pocklington said there had been poor oversight of the ECO4 and the Great British Insulation Scheme by Trustmark, the body responsible for overseeing the quality of the insulation work.

However, he added that the department ''did not oversee these schemes in the way that they should have done''.

Independent MP Rupert Lowe said this amounted to ''systemic failure of a government department''.

Acknowledging this remark, Mr Pocklington, said ''there are serious failings at every level of the system that are systemic'', and that the department ""didn't take enough steps to ensure that Trustmark was set up to deliver appropriately"".

Simon Ayers, the chief executive of Trustmark, earlier told the panel of MPs that his organisation had raised the issue of faulty installations with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero from late-2022, but they were ""informal operational meetings"" and minutes were not taken.

Mr Pocklington explained that the department had been under pressure after dealing with the Covid pandemic and the effect on energy prices of the war in Ukraine.

Labour MP Clive Betts asked Mr Pocklington whether the department would take responsibility for all of the homeowners that have been ''badly treated'' under all of the government's energy efficiency schemes, not just those carried out since 2022.

Mr Pocklington said the focus was on the two schemes which had taken place since 2022.

Asked by Mr Betts if the government would ""stand behind'' affected homeowners, Mr Pocklington said the government's responsibility was ''to ensure that the schemes we put in place operate effectively and that there are appropriate systems of consumer protection in place"".",2025-11-14T17:17:31.953013

Today's disappointing growth figures reflect that the UK has returned to the slower lanes of growth, having outperformed earlier in the year.

The 0.1% growth seen in the July-to-September quarter was below forecasts, and the economy shrank in the month of September.

A breakdown in car production following the cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover does explain September's contraction, and why the overall growth figures were worse than expected.

The ONS told me that if vehicle production had been flat rather than the worst monthly fall on record outside of the pandemic, GDP in September would have gone up.

That is not the full story, though. Momentum in the economy has clearly flagged.

In particular, slowdowns in consumer-facing services and business investment are a key concern.

Higher costs of employment and the constantly rolling uncertainty are not helping.

Consumers remain cautious, with high savings rates, and businesses have not yet turned on the investment taps.

A key objective for the Budget is to end the constant doom loop of speculation about tax changes. There will be a bigger buffer against fiscal shocks, and potential changes to how often the chancellor's borrowing rules are assessed.

Certainty has a price, however, in terms of tax rises. The Budget will try to target the rise in tax away from worker pay packets and investors, but the sums involved make this a tricky task.",2025-11-14T17:17:33.550518

Chris O'Shea was speaking to the BBC as part of the Big Boss Interview series

Chris O'Shea hasn't lived in Scotland for decades but the boss of Centrica, the owner of British Gas, is worried over the future of the energy industry in his homeland. He is concerned that the ""demise"" of drilling for gas and oil in the North Sea and the move to green energy will not create new roles quickly enough to offset job losses. His wide-ranging interview with us follows a series of difficult moments for the industry as soaring energy prices pushed household bills up and saw bumper dividends to shareholders and pay packets to bosses - including him. British Gas also faced a scandal over force-fitting prepayment meters in the homes of vulnerable people who fell behind on bills, something he says the company doesn't do anymore. Today O'Shea says his big concern is the decline in jobs in the North Sea oil and gas industry. The UK's largest oil and gas producer, Harbour Energy, announced job cuts earlier this year. And this month, the Port of Aberdeen said it would cut roles in the face of what it described as a ""staggering"" fall in North Sea oil and gas activity. ""The energy transition is the right thing for us to do. It's essential,"" says O'Shea, pointing out that British Gas no longer explores for oil and gas in the North Sea and benefits more from energy being imported from overseas. That's not to say he doesn't think there should be more drilling in the North Sea. ""Whether you look at this from a cost point of view or whether you look at this from a carbon point of view or environmental point of view, the gas that you produce domestically will often be cheaper than the gas you import, and it will definitely be cleaner than the gas you import,"" he says. But going back to the transition to green energy, he tells the BBC's Big Boss Interview that the question is over the pace at which it needs to happen, drawing on personal experience. ""I grew up in the town of Fife, which was surrounded by coal mines. I saw the devastation when the coal mines were closed during the miners' strike and people that had incredibly well-paid jobs - they went to no work at all. ""You've got second, third-generation people that are not in work now. And I desperately want to avoid that through this transition.""

He says he found it quite hard to get a job after university and ""got loads of rejection letters"". ""I know what it's like to be a bit worried about getting a job,"" he says. ""I also know what it's like to get a job that you like, and you find out that you're good at, it can change your life - it certainly did for me."" However, the chief executive is no stranger to cutting roles, having axed the best part of 5,000 soon after he took charge during the height of the Covid pandemic in April 2020. ""I wasn't sure the company was actually going to survive,"" he says. ""The only way I could justify that to myself was I was trying to protect 20,000 jobs, I couldn't protect them all."" Since then, Centrica has taken on 1,700 apprentices and has committed to taking on one more every day for this decade at least.

Much like energy prices in recent years, it's been a volatile time in the hotseat for O'Shea. As wholesale energy prices soared in part due to supply issues following the outbreak of war in Ukraine, many small suppliers went bust as they were unable to afford the fixed-price deals they'd locked into with customers. ""It's all down to poor regulation,"" O'Shea says, arguing that energy regulator Ofgem should have been stricter on making sure suppliers had enough cash to manage risks. ""You cannot have a system whereby the profits are privatised and the losses are socialised,"" he says. Ofgem told the BBC its regulation meant the sector ""now holds around £7.5bn in assets, a significant reverse from -£1.7bn during the crisis, meaning they are now better protected against failure, and the impact this has on customer's bills"". As energy bills surged, there were questions over bumper dividends to shareholders, and O'Shea's own salary and bonuses which hit £8.2m in 2023. ""Investors invest and they want a return,"" he says. ""People don't put money in the bank and say, 'it's ok, don't give me any interest' and investors don't buy shares and say, 'it's ok, don't give me any return'."" Those dividends, O'Shea argues, are not generated from British Gas customers, and are as a result of other parts of Centrica's diversified business. ""There is very little profit that's made in the energy retail business. You're capped on the profit that you can make at 2.4% of your revenue,"" he says.",2025-11-14T17:17:36.868621

Bloomberg via Getty Images A customer shops at a Costco store in Teterboro, New Jersey, US. The Trump administration on Thursday announced frameworks for trade deals with four Latin American countries, which senior officials said will include tariff relief on coffee and bananas.

The Trump administration on Thursday said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries. The agreements with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador come as US President Donald Trump faces scrutiny over his handling of the economy and concerns about affordability. As part of an initial framework, a reciprocal tariff of 10% will stay on goods from Guatemala, Argentina and El Salvador, as will a 15% tax on imports from Ecuador into the US. But the deals will exempt products that cannot be produced in the US ""in sufficient quantities,"" such as coffee. The US-Argentina deal also addresses beef producers' access to foreign markets.

Trump previously downplayed concerns about cost of living, insisting the outlook had improved during his nine months in office. He said affordability was a ""new word"", and a ""con job"" by Democrats. But he has focused on the issue with some urgency since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's off-year elections across a handful of states. This week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to lower coffee prices, which have jumped about 20% in the US this year. Bessent also signalled relief on tariffs on bananas and other fruits. Senior administration officials on Thursday singled out coffee, cocoa and bananas as examples of imports from the four Latin American countries that are poised to escape tariffs. Guatemala and Ecuador are the biggest exporters of bananas to the US. While the US does import coffee from Central American countries including Guatemala, Brazil is the top coffee exporter to the US, according to data from the Agriculture Department, and is not covered by the deal. Severe weather is also contributing to high prices for coffee and cacao, senior administration officials said. But they added that prices will hopefully fall to some extent when tariffs ease, if retailers and wholesalers pass along savings to consumers.",2025-11-14T17:17:38.397787

Reuters

Growth in the UK economy slowed to 0.1% in the July-to-September period, official figures show, as car production slumped. The figure was below the 0.2% predicted by analysts, and is a blow to Chancellor Rachel Reeves - who has repeatedly said growth is her top priority - less than two weeks ahead of the Budget in which she is widely expected to raise taxes. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a ""marked"" fall in car production in September as a result of the cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover. But even when this is taken out, other sectors of the economy showed weak growth.

While there was growth in services - which includes things like shops, restaurants, arts and entertainment and real estate - and construction, it was slower than in the previous quarter. Consumer spending growth remains weak and economists predict this could continue to weigh on growth for the rest of the year. The latest GDP figure marks a slowdown from the 0.3% growth seen between April and June, and the 0.7% expansion in the first three months of the year. In September alone, the economy contracted by 0.1% with the JLR cyber-attack having an impact. The cyber-attack began on 31 August, and resulted in one of the UK's largest car makers halting production for five weeks. The ONS said production output overall fell by 2% in September, and this was mainly caused by a 28.6% drop in car output following the attack.

Some analysts said the weaker-than-expected growth figures had boosted the chance of a rate cut from the Bank of England next month. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said data ""all but seals a December rate cut"" when added to the weak jobs figures that came out earlier this week. For some businesses, the slow growth reflects the knock-on effect of last year's Budget, which raised National Insurance contributions for employers, as well as increasing the national living wage.

Allan Jones says his business has had to absorb many of the cost increases it has faced

Allan Jones, managing director of pie manufacturer TC Morris, in Dudley, West Midlands, said the cost of running his business, which employs about 50 people, had increased by £200,000 this year. ""I think there's a level at which people are prepared to pay for a pork pie. So we've managed to pass on some increases, but we've had to absorb quite a bit,"" he said. Mr Jones said he hoped to ""see some easing"" from the forthcoming Budget such as lowering taxes and energy costs, as well as increased ""support for investment opportunities"" in the form of government-backed grants. Responding to the ONS data, Reeves said the UK had the fastest-growing economy in the G7 in the first half of the year, but said ""there's more to do to build an economy that works for working people"". ""At my Budget later this month, I will take the fair decisions to build a strong economy that helps us to continue to cut waiting lists, cut the national debt and cut the cost of living,"" she said. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the prime minister and chancellor were ""in office but not in power"" and claimed Sir Keir Starmer had ""stripped the chancellor of responsibility for the Budget"".",2025-11-14T17:17:40.041302

Getty Images Work will begin next year at the Wylfa site (pictured above), with the aim of generating power by the mid 2030s

A first-of-its-kind nuclear power station is to be built on Anglesey, bringing up to 3,000 jobs and billions of pounds of investment. The plant at Wylfa, on the Welsh island's northern coast, will have the UK's first three small modular reactors (SMR), although the site could potentially hold up to eight. Work is due to start next year with the aim of generating power by the mid 2030s. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Britain was once a world leader in nuclear power but ""years of neglect and inertia has meant places like Anglesey have been let down and left behind. Today, that changes.""

The project, which could power about three million homes, will be built by publicly owned Great British Energy-Nuclear and is backed by a £2.5bn investment from the UK government. Visiting a further education college in north Wales on Thursday, Sir Keir said the development would bring jobs for ""decades to come"" and that work would begin ""virtually straight away"". Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan, who said she had been ""pressing the case at every opportunity for Wylfa's incredible benefits"". SMRs work similarly to large reactors, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that produces electricity - but are a fraction of the size, with about a third of the generating output. Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, called the announcement ""exciting"" and said Britain is in the race for new reactors. Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Miliband added they hope to ""work with local colleges to make sure that there are local skills providers, skills training opportunities, so local people get these jobs"".

Rolls-Royce

Simon Bowen, chair of Great British Energy-Nuclear, hailed an ""historic moment for the UK"". Llinos Medi, the MP for Ynys Môn, the Welsh name for Anglesey, said it was a ""game-changer"" for the area ""but only if local people see real and lasting benefits"". Mims Davies MP, the Shadow Secretary of State for Wales, said it will bring much-needed jobs and investment but ""the current plan will only generate a fraction of the power that a Gigawatt-powered plant would"". Anthony Slaughter, leader of Wales Green Party, said the project was ""an expensive distraction from the clean, fast and cheap renewables already available to us"". He added ""a fast, ambitious roll-out of solar, wind and wave energy that will create jobs and cut energy bills"" was needed. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales said the plant would bring a ""once in a generation"" boost for jobs, supply chains and regional infrastructure.

Great British Energy-Nuclear has also been tasked with identifying potential sites across the UK for another large-scale nuclear power plant, similar to those being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset and Sizewell in Suffolk, which can power the equivalent of six million homes. The company will report back by autumn 2026, officials said. It is not clear whether the SMR plans, which are smaller and more straightforward to build, rule Wylfa out after it was designated the preferred location in 2024 by the previous UK Conservative government.

'Nuclear equivalent of an Ikea chair'

Prof Simon Middleburgh, director of the Nuclear Futures Institute at Bangor University, said the SMRs would be ""built in a modular manner in factories and shipped to the site to be put together a bit like an Ikea chair"". There were ""a few more hurdles to go through"", he cautioned - from securing regulatory approval, building the factories required to construct the SMRs and training the workforce that will run them. Opponents of the project point to the fact that a long-term storage facility for the UK's nuclear waste is yet to be agreed upon and say investment in renewable energy schemes - wind, wave and tidal - is what Anglesey needs. Dylan Morgan, of the People Against Wylfa-B campaign group, said the proposed SMRs were ""an unnecessarily big development of an unproven technology"". The government sees them as a secure, reliable, affordable and low carbon energy system and is convinced that, with investment, SMRs will create thousands of jobs and boost manufacturing. Wylfa beat competition from a site at Oldbury in Gloucestershire, with the reactors designed by Rolls-Royce, subject to final contracts, which are expected later this year.

PA Media Ministers saw maps of the Wylfa plant during a visit to Coleg Menai on Anglesey

The UK government said the plant would help provide energy independence. The decision to opt for small modular reactors at Wylfa was criticised by the US ambassador Warren Stephens, who said he was ""extremely disappointed"". He had urged ministers to commit to a large-scale plant, with US firm Westinghouse having reportedly presented plans for a new gigawatt station at the site. Downing Street said the decision to build the power station in Wales ""doesn't close the door"" to a US manufacturer working on a future project.

The old nuclear power plant at Wylfa was switched off in 2015 and previous plans for a large-scale replacement fell through in 2021. The company behind the scheme – the Japanese industrial giant Hitachi - cited spiralling costs and a failure to reach agreement with the UK government over funding.

There is a huge political component to the announcement, with Labour's leadership in Westminster keen to show it means business on big investment in infrastructure projects. In Wales, the first minister has been pushing hard for Wylfa - and the announcement comes six months before the Senedd election. Eluned Morgan has been trying to strike a balance: differentiating the Welsh party from UK Labour, while pushing for extra funding, further devolution of powers and big investment announcements from her UK colleagues. She has certainly got the latter, although plenty of other issues such as reform to how Wales is funded and devolution of the Crown Estate – which owns much of the Welsh coastline and is vital to future wind power – remain unresolved.",2025-11-14T17:17:41.677448

Getty Images Government bonds allow money to be raised through the markets

The Scottish government is ""on track"" to issue its first ever bonds in the next financial year, according to the first minister. John Swinney confirmed bonds should be issued in 2026-27, though this is subject to the outcome of May's Holyrood election as well as other factors. The news came as the Scottish government was given the same status as the UK by two global credit rating companies. The government wants to issue bonds - which will allow it to borrow money from investors who in return receive regular interest payments - to raise money for infrastructure projects.

Credit rating company Moody's rated the Scottish government as Aa3 while rivals S&P Global rated it as AA, both identical to the UK's sovereign rating. Moody's said its rating was based on the Scottish government's ""prudent fiscal management"" and the country's economic stability. S&P said Scotland's economy was ""strong"" with the country operating ""within a stable and predictable institutional framework that provides strong oversight and well-defined arrangements with the UK central government."" Both agencies cautioned that their ratings could potentially be cut if Scotland moves towards independence.

Swinney said the ""high credit ratings"" for the Scottish government came as a result of its ""track record of responsible fiscal management and pro-business environment"". He said Scotland is ""now on track to commence the bond programme from 2026-27, with the proceeds used to fund capital investment in key infrastructure"". ""This is about using the powers we have to borrow better - not more - and reflects the maturity of Scotland's public finances after more than 25 years of devolution,"" he said. ""It is the latest step in building the institutions and tools Scotland needs for a prosperous future where our country takes responsibility for its own decisions."" Swinney said details of how the bonds will be issued will be subject to market conditions closer to the time. He added the Scottish government would ""shortly commence engagement with banks to act as joint lead managers to enable the next Scottish government to proceed without delay"" on the proposed scheme.

What are government bonds?

When a government wants to borrow money from investors, it sells them something called a bond, which is a loan the government promises to pay back at the end of an agreed time - say five, ten, or 30 years. The government will also make regular payments - which can be once every three months, six months, or year - to the investor. In the UK, a government bond is called a gilt. As a play on this term, the Scottish bonds have been nicknamed ""kilts"". The Scottish government has had the power to issue bonds since 2016 but has previously borrowed money from the UK National Loans Fund, which is the UK government's main account for managing its borrowing and lending. Until recently there were stricter limits on how much it could raise through bonds. Some analysis by the Scottish government suggests that bonds could offer better value for money under certain circumstances as well as greater flexibility. In 2023, then First Minister Humza Yousaf commissioned initial work with the goal of issuing bonds before the end of the current Scottish Parliament session. That came after advisers in the Scottish government's Investor Panel recommended making bonds available to the market as a means of raising Scotland's profile and attracting investment.

What difference would independence make to credit ratings?

Having a system for issuing bonds already in place, rather than having to set one up from scratch, would be helpful if Scotland did choose to become independent. However, the Moody's report also included independence as a possible factor which could see Scotland's credit rating downgraded. It said: ""Although not our baseline scenario, Scottish independence could exert downward pressure on the rating by introducing heightened uncertainty about the institutional framework and potentially raising financial stability risks."" Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Craig Hoy said: ""Scotland's good rating is a direct result of us being part of the UK, and the financial security that brings. ""Despite the desperate attempts by the SNP to spin it otherwise, the ratings agencies highlight the economic stability we enjoy from being part of the Union. ""Both S&P and Moody's say that the ratings would be downgraded if there were any moves towards breaking up the UK. ""We know that John Swinney will never stop pushing his independence obsession, but the ratings agencies recognise how damaging that would be for our economy.""

Foster's is set to lower the alcohol strength in its UK-brewed lager from February

The change is set to go into effect by February, marking the second time in three years that Foster's alcohol percentage, or ABV, has been diluted.

The brewer hinted at cheaper pints saying ""customers benefit from more competitive pricing"" because of the lower tax charge.

Heineken UK, which brews Foster's, said cutting the alcohol strength from the current 3.7% would make the lager eligible for lower rates of alcohol duty.

Foster's beer drinkers in the UK will soon find their lager's alcohol strength cut to 3.4%.

Heineken UK said it was responding to changes in UK government policy, which have encouraged brewers to offer lower alcohol options.

The government introduced a new system of alcohol duties based on strength in August 2023, which made less alcoholic beers and ciders relatively cheaper compared to more powerful alternatives.

Since then, rival brews Carlsberg Pilsner, Sol, Coors Light and Grolsch have also been reformulated to an ABV below 3.4% to qualify for the lower rate of tax in the UK.

It insisted punters would not notice the difference, after ""extensive"" consumer testing.

Heineken said there had been a ""continued shift"" in beer-drinking trends, toward lower-ABV options ""as part of a balanced and health-conscious lifestyle"".

Heineken last month said its global beer sales would fall next year as drinkers cut back because of pressure on their household budgets.

In its third quarter results, the global brewer said the UK had bucked the global trend of falling beer volume sales, which it blamed on squeezed consumer budgets.

SSEN SSE's plans include erecting tall pylons and and building large sub-stations

The company that controls the electricity grid in the north of Scotland has announced plans to invest £33bn over five years. SSE has set out plans to spend two-thirds of that to upgrade wiring and increase high-voltage grid capacity to get power from the north to customers in the south. However, the Perth-based company faces strong criticism of some its plans, for the impact they will have on the Highlands and rural Aberdeenshire. The plans include erecting tall pylons and and building large sub-stations.

SSE Martin Pibworth, SSE's chief executive, says he is confident Scotland has sufficient skills to support the plans

The other third of the new investment plan is partly for lower-voltage wiring in the two areas where the company has the distribution franchise and monopoly - the north of Scotland and central southern England, where it took over Southern Electric 27 years ago. That will take £5bn of the investment plan up to 2030, some of it to improve the capacity of homes to run air heat converters and car charging through household meters. The company is putting a reduced share of its investment effort into offshore wind power, though it remains a major developer in the North Sea.

World's largest wind farms

SSE is constructing the Dogger Bank wind farm, which will be the world's largest, and it has permission to build the Berwick Bank array, off the south-east coast of Scotland, which will then become the world's largest when it is completed. Martin Pibworth, the company's new chief executive, is confident that the plan is ""focussed, disciplined and comprehensively funded"". That funding process began with the successful placing, on Tuesday morning, of £2bn-worth of new SSE shares, taken up by existing investors. Unusually for a utility, its share price rose nearly 16% at its peak, before ending the day 11% up. Other funding will come through the company's income from its current assets, and from debt.

SSE Renewables SSE is also behind the The Dogger Bank scheme off the East Yorkshire coast

Mr Pibworth, who took over from Alistair Phillips-Davies as chief executive of SSE three months ago, is also confident that there will be sufficient skills to carry out the work. The networks transmission division is expanding its staff five-fold to 2,500 by shifting people within SSE, while recruiting apprentices, graduates and seeking out those in the offshore oil and gas industry. More widely, SSE directly employs 7,000 people in Scotland, and more than 10,000 indirectly, while that extends to a total of nearly 49,000 across the UK. However, the company faces criticism about the scale of the 11 major transmission projects it has under way - similar to the difficulties in winning community support for grid connections in England and Wales, where National Grid plc runs the network, and in the south of Scotland, where the monopoly provider of high-voltage cabling is Scottish Power.

Impact on the landscape

Community councils from across the Highlands have come together to raise their concerns. The Highland Council recently published a strongly-worded critique of one of the most contentious power lines, stretching 107 miles from the north of Caithness through eastern Sutherland and Easter Ross to the central Highland village of Beauly. That is now the meeting point for four major lines, and will require an additional, very large sub-station. Although the local and planning authority is responsible for land along the entire route of the line, the project goes to the Scottish government for planning approval. Mr Pibworth told BBC Scotland News: ""We've carried out the widest, broadest consultation ever held in the north of Scotland. ""We've held 250-plus meetings with communities, to make sure they understand the plan. ""The rewiring of Scotland needs to be done. We need to get renewables (energy) flowing through to demand centres. ""We need to make sure we have an energy system which is reliable, that is not exposed to international markets and geopolitics through gas price volatility, that is secure and clean, and that is resourced with good jobs in our local communities. ""Those plans are being pulled together now,"" the chief executive said. ""We are listening to councils and communities, and trying to work with them, to make sure we can adopt where it's possible to do so. ""But these networks have to be built, for the good of the economy and for green jobs and for the good of prosperity as we electrify our economy.""",2025-11-14T17:17:50.334320

Getty Images The backlog of driving tests grew after the covid-19 lockdown

Only learner drivers will be able to book driving tests in plans aimed at reducing long waiting lists and preventing slots being sold at inflated prices. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said limiting third parties from reselling slots would stop people being ""exploited"" by online bots. But she admitted to MPs on the Transport committee that waiting times for driving tests would not be brought down to seven weeks by summer 2026, the most recent deadline she set. The average waiting time was 21.8 weeks at the end of June.

Currently, instructors can book tests on behalf of their students, but this will be banned as part of the changes. Limits will also be placed on the number of times a driver can move or swap a test, and the area they can move a test to once they have booked it. Amelia Lightfoot, a 20-year-old learner driver from Devon, said it took more than a month for her to secure a test, having made daily visits to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) website to book a slot. She said when she eventually got a date, it was six months away. But she failed that test and is now struggling to book another. ""Because I live in a rural area with very poor public transport, having a driving licence would significantly improve my quality of life. ""The situation is incredibly frustrating and feels very unfair,"" she said. Additionally, 36 examiners from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) will be brought into the DVSA to try to reduce the backlog. These examiners are civil servants, not military personnel. The DVSA has recruited 316 new examiners, but Alexander said that has resulted in a net gain of only 40 as others have left. Driving examiners will be offered a ""retention payment"" of £5,000 from next year to try and keep them in the role. Ruth Cadbury MP, the chair of the Transport Committee, said efforts to replace the current test booking system were moving at a ""glacial pace"" and it was ""a shame"" that the summer 2026 target would be missed. ""We will continue to ask the Department for Transport for regular updates on this issue.""

Re-selling tests

Every week, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) makes more tests available but many are rapidly booked up by bots. Companies then resell the test slots at inflated prices. Last month, 38 MPs signed a letter calling on the government to take ""the strongest possible action"" on the issue of re-selling tests. The driving test costs £62 for a weekday slot or £75 for evenings and weekends. The letter said some third-party sellers are charging up to £500. Labour MP Amanda Hack, who organised the letter, said she supported the changes. ""The surge in [test] prices is linked to widespread test swapping since the Covid pandemic. While some changes are legitimate, bots and third parties exploit unlimited swaps, hoovering up tests and making it harder for genuine learners.""

By the end of last month, there were 642,000 learner drivers with a test booked. The DVSA has said the backlog is a result of increased demand and people booking tests much earlier than before. Some 182,000 tests took place last month, an increase of 9% from October 2024. Aman Sanghera, who runs driving school Clearview Driving in west London, said the changes were ""the fairest way to fix the current system"". She said that limiting how many times a test can be swapped or amended would ""stop third-party companies from exploiting vulnerable learners and make the whole process more transparent"".",2025-11-14T17:17:51.887095

The boss of one of the UK's largest online retailers has predicted automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will slash his workforce by two-thirds within the next three years. Nick Glynne, the boss of Buy It Direct which owns Appliances Direct, told BBC 5 Live's Wake Up To Money that future prospects for hiring people in the UK was ""very bleak"" for his business. The company employs more than 800 staff and more than 500 jobs were estimated to go. This was not a ""fixed plan"", though the process was being sped up by extra costs placed on the firm by the government, Mr Glynne said. HM Treasury said higher taxes on employers had allowed it to ""deliver on the priorities of the British people"".

Buy It Direct, which is based in Huddersfield, operates a number of online retail brands including Furniture 123. It is a global company, employing another 150 staff overseas, with a customer service operation in the Philippines. Mr Glynne said increases in the national living wage and national insurance contributions, which came into effect in April, were among the government's ""tax decisions [which] have accelerated the direction of travel"". ""So much so that our forecast is to have two-thirds less people, with the same revenue, same activity; two-thirds less people in an office environment within three years, and two-thirds less in our warehouse environment through investment in automation. ""A mixture of AI on the office side, and technology involving robots and automation and mechanisation in the warehouse, means that the future for employing UK people is very bleak for someone like us."" A HM Treasury spokesperson defended the government as ""pro-business"". It pointed to a corporation tax capped at 25%, and said the government was reforming business rates and had secured trade deals with the US, EU and India. ""The tax decisions we took at the Budget last year mean that we have been able to deliver on the priorities of the British people, from investing in the NHS to cutting waiting lists and putting more money in their pockets with a wage boost for millions,"" the spokesperson said. The retail chief executive's comments come at a time of increasing concern about jobs - especially entry level positions - being lost to AI. Graduates in graphics design and computer science are among those who have said they find themselves competing against technology for roles. At the end of last month, Amazon announced it was axing 14,000 jobs, saying it needed to be ""organised more leanly"" to seize the opportunity provided by AI.

PA Media

Thousands of NHS staff redundancies in England will now go ahead after a deal was reached with the Treasury to allow the health service to overspend this year to cover the cost of pay-offs. The government said earlier this year 18,000 admin and managerial jobs would go with NHS England, the body that runs the NHS, being brought into the Department of Health and Social Care alongside cuts to local health boards. NHS bosses and health ministers had been in talks with the Treasury over how to pay for the £1bn one-off bill with the health service wanting extra money. The Treasury blocked that, but the BBC understands a compromise has been reached with the NHS permitted to overspend this year.

'Pragmatic step'

As the job cuts result in savings in future years, the NHS will be expected to recoup the costs further down the line. Overall, government sources said no extra money is going into the NHS beyond what was agreed at the spending review this year – an extra £29bn a year above inflation by 2028-29. Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Breakfast that patients and NHS staff had told him the health service had ""too many layers of management, too many layers of bureaucracy"". ""People want to see the front line prioritised, and that is exactly what we're doing,"" he said, adding he would tell NHS leaders ""we're finally on the road to recovery"" in his speech later on Wednesday. In a speech to health managers at the NHS Providers' conference in Manchester later, Streeting is expected to say: ""I want to reassure taxpayers that every penny they are being asked to pay will be spent wisely. ""We're now pushing down on the accelerator and slashing unnecessary bureaucracy, to reinvest the savings in front-line care. ""It won't happen overnight, but with our investment and modernisation, we will rebuild our NHS so it is there for you when you need it once again."" According to the government, the reforms will raise £1bn a year by the end of the parliament to improve services for patients. It said every £1bn saved in bureaucracy costs is enough to fund an extra 116,000 hip and knee operations.

NHS England is expected to be brought back into the Department of Health within two years, while the cuts to integrated care boards (ICBs), which plan health services for individual regions, will reduce their headcounts by 50%. NHS Providers' chief executive Daniel Elkeles said: ""This is a pragmatic step that means planned redundancies can now go ahead. ""It reflects the flexibility of a three-year settlement, allowing some funding to be brought forward in order to generate future savings to go into front-line care. ""However, we must recognise the position of staff affected by these changes - people who have offered commitment and service to the NHS - who face a very uncertain future."" But Patricia Marquis of the Royal College of Nursing warned the redundancies could backfire. ""Front-line services need more investment, but to do this off the backs of making thousands of experts redundant is a false economy. ""Expert registered nurses working across NHS England and ICBs don't just run vital public health programmes and oversee care programmes for the vulnerable – they connect the NHS and social care services with one another. ""To imply these are administrators shows a complete lack of understanding of their roles and how they contribute to patient care.""

Why is NHS England being abolished?

NHS England - the body that runs the NHS in England - was created as part of the 2012 reforms introduced under former Tory health secretary Andrew Lansley. The idea was to free the health service from political meddling – with ministers instead setting the wider strategy, but stepping back from getting involved on a daily basis. But Lansley's successor as health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said recently NHS England had ended up a ""bureaucratic monster"" that stifles innovation with reports some organisations were at times filling out 250 forms a month just to satisfy both NHS England and the health department. And on the front line, one of the most common complaints is that NHS England was incredibly controlling, even requesting individual NHS trusts ask for permission for something as mundane as granting media interviews. But make no mistake, this is also about control. Ministers have argued it is only right that a democratically-elected government was in charge of day-to-day running of the health service. But given Labour, in opposition, was critical of the Tories messing around with NHS structures, embarking on its own reorganisation comes with significant risk. Those working in the health service already talk about the disruption and distraction these changes are causing - and given NHS England oversees the day-to-day running of the health service, organises some specialist services and has a role in training and digital innovation, it is not difficult to see why there are some serious concerns about the reforms.",2025-11-14T17:17:55.049644

Passengers who present printed boarding passes at airports will no longer be accepted to fly with Ryanair, the company has announced. One of Europe's biggest budget airlines said it was ""moving to 100% digital boarding passes"" from Wednesday in a bid to speed up travel and lower costs. It said all customers needed to check in online before arriving at the airport, adding that 90% of its 206 million passengers were already doing so and using digital boarding passes. Some campaign groups have raised concerns about how the change will affect people who do not have access to the internet.

A recent report by communications watchdog Ofcom found 5% of people in the UK do not have internet access at home - including via a mobile device. Dennis Reed, from campaign group Silver Voices, told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme the change was ""the tip of an iceberg"". He said many services required apps or QR codes, which older people found challenging to use. ""The digital revolution has gone completely bonkers to be honest,"" he said. Age UK said that companies that move more processes online still had a responsibility to offer an alternative way of booking, checking in and showing tickets. Ryanair should not ""forget the 4.3 million older people who do not use a smart phone,"" said Caroline Abrahams, Age UK's charity director. Peggy-Ann Munroe, 94, from Suffolk, said she frequently travels with Ryanair to visit her daughter in Italy and had found the airline's digital move ""depressing"". She said she was worried about adding extra travel time on top of the two hours already needed before her flight, as well as navigating an unfamiliar system in a country where she cannot speak the language. ""I would be very sad to not be able to go and see my daughter, I look forward to it. It's the highlight of my year,"" she said.

Watch: Moment the last US penny is minted

The US is set to make its final penny. The Philadelphia Mint will strike its last batch of one-cent coins on Wednesday, after more than 230 years of production. The coins will remain in circulation but the phase-out has already prompted businesses to start adjusting prices, as they say pennies are becoming harder to find. The government says the move will save money, or as President Donald Trump put it in February when he first announced the plans: ""Rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time"".

Pennies, which honour Civil War president Abraham Lincoln and are made of copper-plated zinc, today cost nearly four cents each to make — more than twice the cost of a decade ago, according to the Treasury Department. It estimates the decision to end production will save about $56m a year. Officials have argued that the rise of electronic transactions is making the penny, which first went into production in 1793, increasingly moot. The Treasury Department estimates that about 300 billion of the coins will remain in circulation, ""far exceeding the amount needed for commerce"". Many pennies end up falling out of use. About 60% of all coins in circulation in the US - or about $60-$90 for the typical household - sits stashed at home in piggy banks, deemed not worth trading in, according to a 2022 government analysis. But penny-pinchers beware: as businesses start rounding up prices, the move is expected to raise costs for shoppers. One study by researchers at the Richmond Federal Reserve estimated that could cost consumers $6m annually.

Other countries have also phased out their lowest value coins. Canada, for example, made its last batch of one cent coins in 2012. Australia and New Zealand retired one and two cent coins in the 1990s, and New Zealand stopped production of five cent coins in 2006. The UK floated a plan to scrap 1p coins in 2018, though the proposal was later withdrawn. But the rise of electronic transactions did prompt the UK to halt production of coins in 2024, after officials decided there were sufficient 1p and 2p coins in circulation.",2025-11-14T17:17:59.748849

The UK's biggest building society, the Nationwide, has pledged to keep all of its 696 branches open until at least 2030. This is a two-year extension to the promise it had already made not to close branches, after it reported a rise in customers using them in the last year. The UK bank and building society sector has seen widespread branch closures in recent years, as many customers have switched to online and mobile banking. Charities have expressed concerns over vulnerable people's access to cash and other financial services, while reports have highlighted the impact of closures on UK High Streets.

Debbie Crosbie, Nationwide's chief executive, said branches were important for ""customers and communities"". Over a 10-year period, Nationwide closed 152, or 20% of its branches, before it made its non-closure promise in 2023. Last year, a Nationwide advert featuring actor Dominic West that claimed the building society was not closing branches was banned. West featured as the boss of a fictional big bank who mocks customers while planning branch closures. In the last decade, more than 6,000 UK bank branches have closed, according to consumer group Which?. Banks say this is in direct response to customers' changing habits, with relatively few now going into branches regularly.

Security and safety

The Nationwide took over Virgin Money last year, and its 91 branches are part of the new promise. The group has reported customers increasingly using in-branch cash machines, with security named as one of the reasons behind this. And the building society said it wanted to protect vulnerable people and offer more support services.

Jessica Bleasby says branches have a financial and personal impact

At one of its busiest branches in Reading, senior branch manager Jessica Bleasby, said some customers needed reassurance. ""In branches, we are making an impact financially and on a personal level,"" she said. Some may question whether banks, as competitive businesses, should feel obliged to offer wider support, especially to those who are not their customers. Building societies, which are owned by their members, may have a greater responsibility.

Lynn Wheeler helped protect an elderly customer from fraudsters

Lynn Wheeler has worked at Nationwide for 39 years in a series of roles. She is now a customer representative. She said her job included protecting people from scams. Among those was an elderly man who calmly said he wanted to close down an account. After questioning, it emerged that fraudsters wanted his money and they had told him to get a taxi to the branch. Lynn followed the protocol that brought police officers into the branch to talk to him, along with a member of his family, saving him from any further losses.

Toy sales have risen for the first time since the pandemic, analysts say, as brands aim to appeal to children and adults. The value of sales rose by 6% in the year to September compared with the same period last year, according to research company Circana. Film releases such as Stitch, sports like Formula 1 and the popularity of brands such as Lego have driven sales. With so-called ""kidults"" responsible for a third of sales, many manufacturers and sellers are targeting a sweet spot of products that different generations want to play and collect.

""The products that are doing really well at the moment, such as Lego and Pokemon, are the ones that have that cross-generational appeal,"" said Melissa Symonds, UK toys director at Circana, which tracks toy sales. ""It is a really difficult balance to hit, and some won't be able to make it. Some will focus on just the pre-school market, and some on adults - but the real trick is getting the balance between the two age groups."" Sales of toys and games saw a big lift during Covid as more families spent time at home during lockdowns, but sales had fallen since 2021 until this year. The kidult market - which is toys and games for those aged over 12 - has been growing, particularly as adults buy toys for themselves.

Melissa Symonds says toys are offering some light relief to people

The Toy Retailers Association, which represents sellers, has launched the latest of its annual DreamToys series, which lists what it anticipates to be some of the big sellers this Christmas. Some of this year's picks clearly target more than one generation. The Hot Wheels F1 racing circuit has a higher-priced set for older collectors, with more accurate livery on the cars. However, nostalgia also plays a part. Emma Bunce, from Pokemon, said that many parents collected the cards when they were children up to 30 years ago.

A penny is worth one cent, or one-hundredth of a US dollar.

In February, President Donald Trump said producing the coin was wasteful and too expensive and on social media called to ""rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time"".

""That adds up really quickly,"" said Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations with the National Retail Federation

Since the Trump administration ended minting the one-cent coins earlier this year, those still in circulation are becoming harder to find. Many stores are now rounding their cash sales down to the nearest five cents, saying there are no federal guidelines on how to proceed.

The US Mint officially stopped making pennies in May. The Treasury Department estimated shortages would start in early 2026, but they actually came much sooner. Banks can't get pennies from the federal government, so businesses can't get them from the banks.

""We first heard about the issue in late August, early September,"" Mr Jeon said. ""It's really impacting any business that deals with cash payments.""

Now store clerks don't know what to do when their tills are bare and someone needs change in pennies from a cash purchase.

The temporary solution for many, Mr Jeon said, is rounding the price of the sale up or down to the nearest five cents so the customer can use a nickel, the next lowest tender in the US.

But some cities, including New York, require retailers to give exact change and others don't allow cash payments to differ from card payments for the same item, Mr Jeon said.

To avoid lawsuits and customer complaints, many retailers have chosen to just round down.

""You're talking about losing up to four cents for every cash transaction across multiple stores across the country,"" he said. ""It's unsustainable.""

Many stores are now urging customers to pay in exact change. Others are hosting promotions for customers to bring in extra pennies they have at home.

Convenience stores are some of the hardest hit by the shortage, said Jeff Lenard, a spokesperson for the National Association of Convenience Stores.

Convenience giant Kwik Trip has announced it is rounding down to the nickel, which it says will cost it up to $3m (£2.3m) this year.

American coins have been discontinued before, including the half-cent, three-cent and 20-cent pieces that were retired in the 1800s, Mr Lenard said. It's been many years, though, since a staple like the penny - which entered ciruclation in 1793 - has ceased production.

Getty Images Scott Bessent is the face of America's gamble on Argentina

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been the point-person entrusted with selling financial markets on some of President Donald Trump's riskiest economic gambles: sweeping global tariffs, trade talks with China and preparations to install a new leader at the US central bank. But Bessent's trickiest task may just be the White House bet on Argentina. The US stepped onto the scene in mid-September, responding to a plunge in the peso - the Argentine currency - which officials feared could imperil Trump ally President Javier Milei and his party in looming midterm elections. Bessent said the US would do whatever was needed to stabilise the situation, calling the country a key ally in the region. In political terms, the US intervention - which included purchases of pesos and the establishment of a $20bn (£15bn) currency swap line that gives the Argentine central bank access to dollars - was a success for Milei. His party not only fended off losses in the midterm elections but made inroads, strengthening his position.

But whether the US intervention in the country will be a success financially is another question. The peso has fallen roughly 30% this year, including roughly 4% over the last month. The drop came despite the US commitments - and a modest rally after the election. It's an indication of the ongoing risk. At the end of the day, the US could find itself holding a pile of pesos worth much less than they were originally. The intervention in Argentina was a highly unusual move - especially from a White House known for its ""America First"" approach. Milei has endeared himself to conservatives in the US with his embrace of free-market reforms and radical spending cuts. He has met frequently with Trump, who has called him his ""favourite president"". But the US has rarely offered financial bailouts to other countries - especially in a case that posed no wider financial stability risks - and direct purchases of a struggling emerging market currency are unprecedented, says Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Adding to the risk is Argentina's long history of currency devaluation and debt default, including most recently in 2020.

Getty Images Milei's party took 13 of 24 upper-house seats and 64 of the 127 lower-house seats that were contested in a recent election

Few are positioned to be as aware of the potential pitfalls as Bessent, who made his name as a currency trader working for George Soros. Bessent famously took part in the 1992 speculation against the British pound. At that time, investors who bet that Sterling had been overvalued were said to have broken the Bank of England with their heavy selling. This time, Bessent finds himself on the opposite side of similar gamble. He has defended his moves, invoking the spectre of fellow South American country, Venezuela, and arguing that failure to shore up Argentina as a US ally could lead to destabilisation in the region. ""These results are a clear example that the Trump Administration policy of Peace through Economic Strength is working,"" Bessent wrote on social media after the recent election in Argentina.

On Wednesday, Bessent posted again to say: ""the Argentine economic bridge has now turned a profit for the American people"". The US Treasury Department did not respond to inquiries seeking more details. But it has kept quiet about key information needed to assess Bessent's claims - including the timeline and scale of its peso purchases - or sales - and what, if any, other assets the Argentine government pledged in order to secure the swap deal. Analysts have estimated the US has purchased as much as $2bn worth of pesos so far - hardly an earth-shattering figure. But Democrats have criticised the help at a time of White House spending cuts and an ongoing government shutdown, accusing Bessent of wanting to protect finance ""buddies"" with investments in the country. Even some members of Trump's own Republican Party have questioned how the aid aligns with the president's ""America First"" goals.

Bessent has disputed any characterisation of the US support for Argentina as a ""bailout"", promising there will be ""no taxpayer losses"" and even declaring the peso ""undervalued"". But while that could be true for a short-term trade, that view is not the general consensus. To the contrary - most analysts say the peso is overvalued, but has been propped up by support from the Argentine central bank, which set trading limits for the peso in April. Economists say maintaining such limits is not sustainable. They cite the surge in Argentines travelling to make purchases in neighbouring countries where their money travels farther as one of the signs that the peso is being held artificially high. The Argentine central bank has insisted it is committed to the trading band, which was intended to protect the country from wild currency swings destabilising prices and support Milei's efforts to control inflation. But it has already had to spend billions buying pesos to keep the currency steady, burning through International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding and dipping into its foreign reserves, which are key to paying its debt obligations. Economists say they expect the bank will have to change its policy to allow the peso to fall more - or the country risks needing another bailout. That choice presents a dilemma for Bessent, given his promises to guard the US against losses. ""Is the US willing to provide support to Argentina so that Argentina can defend the peso at this level?"" Mr Setser asks. ""Bessent has to decide in a sense whether to double down... or he has to let the peso adjust and recognise that his intervention was a bridge to the election.""

PureSeoul Korean K-beauty products have caught the imagination of skincare buyers around the world

Korean skincare or ""K-beauty"" products are very popular around the world. But as exports from South Korea hit $10.3bn (£7.7bn) last year, cosmetics companies in other countries have introduced their own K-beauty ranges that are not Korean-made. Does this blurring of the definition matter? K-beauty products first came to international attention in the 2010s, part of a wave of other Korean exports, such as K-pop and K-drama. The K-beauty skincare regime can be very elaborate, involving as many as 10 different steps, each requiring a separate product. This caught the imagination of people around the world, and sales rose sharply. Annual exports from South Korea increased from $650m in 2011 to $4bn in 2017, according to official figures, a sixfold rise in just six years.

Recognising this huge jump in demand, cosmetics brand Seoul Ceuticals was launched in 2017, named after the South Korean capital. ""We started to see this increase in growth in interest in K-beauty, and began developing a skincare brand to meet that demand… when we really saw it emerging in the US,"" says Seoul Ceuticals' director of retail relationship Ann Majeski. ""It has been extremely successful. We expect to do over $14m in sales in 2025. We've seen a global acceptance and demand for the K-beauty products. We've started selling in India, Latin America, Europe and Australia."" But Seoul Ceuticals is not a Korean company. It is based in the US, where it also manufacturers all its products. The business doesn't claim to be Korean, but it does say that it makes ""real, authentic Korean skincare"". That may sound like a contradiction, but the company says it isn't because its ingredients are sourced from South Korea. ""I think we were a little more sensitive about it when we were first starting, because we wanted to be very transparent that the products are made in the US,"" says Ms Majeski. ""[But] we source our ingredients in Korea… we wanted to be able to legitimately say we are a K-beauty brand."" But not everyone would agree with this.

PureSeoul Exports of K-beauty products from South Korea were more than $10bn last year

""The products should be manufactured by a Korean manufacturer,"" says Seung Gu Kim, co-founder of K-beauty cosmetics firm Hwarangpoom. He runs the business with his wife Elisa Ahonpää-Kim. While they are based in Finland, all of their team except Elisa are Korean, and all their products are made in South Korea. ""The most important thing that we both absolutely agree is that the brand should develop its concept, and ideas, and products with a Korean perspective,"" says Mr Kim. ""That can come through in the ingredients, the design. Or cultural elements, basically anything that clearly connects to the brands to Korea, or at least reflects a Korean influence."" However, the couple do admit that the definition of K-beauty remains complex. ""I guess it's a very vague concept, because on the market you will find a lot of brands that are made by Koreans who live abroad,"" says Ms Ahonpää-Kim. ""And then brands like Lancôme and Clinique manufacture their products in Korea and Japan, but then it doesn't make those brands Japanese and Korean.""

There is currently no official definition of K-beauty. And there is no protected designation of origin to defend it, like in the case of Champagne or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. And there is no plan to set one up, according to the K-beauty Industry Association, the only K-beauty trade body officially approved by the South Korean government. ""We are currently more focused in promoting and expanding K-beauty,"" says the organisation's chairman Chang Nam Jang. ""While the trend is quite established in Asia, it is only just starting in Europe and the US, and we don't want to throttle the growth by imposing any sanctions on them."" However, the association does have rules for its members – they must be companies that are registered in South Korea, and their products must be officially tested and approved by Korea Food & Drug Administration. That approval is required in order to sell inside South Korea. ""If a product is developed in a way that suits the climate and environment of Korea, and is recognized as a viable product in the Korean market, then we would acknowledge it as K-beauty,"" says Mr Jang. Hwarangpoom agrees with this definition, and has received approval from KFDA. And Seoul Ceuticals has also started the process to attain KFDA approval, to bring their products to Korean consumers.

With K-beauty exports from South Korea in 2024 20% higher than in 2023, there is a lot of money to be made in the sector whether the firms are homegrown or not. In fact, South Korea is now the largest exporter of cosmetic products after France and the US. However, this success has spawned counterfeiters. Mark Lee is the CEO of MarqVision, a US-based business helps firms spot fakes and get them removed from sale. ""For a major Korean beauty brand, which I cannot disclose, we recently conducted 29 test purchases across major US marketplaces,"" he says. ""Twenty six of them were fake. So that's a 90% counterfeit rate."" And in 2024 as a whole, Marqvision identified $280m worth of fake K-beauty products in the US market alone. The high number of counterfeits greatly frustrated K-beauty fan Gracie Tullio. ""Shopping online for K-beauty was a really scary experience,"" she says.

No claws, or pincers, but four fingers and a thumb opening and closing slowly, with joints in all the right places. ""We're not trying to build Terminator,"" jokes Rich Walker, director of Shadow Robot, the firm that made them.

There were 131,000 vacancies for adult care workers in England, a report by charity, Skills for Care, found last year. And in all, around two million people aged 65 and over in England are living with unmet care needs, according to Age UK. By 2050, one in four people in the UK is expected to be aged 65 or over, potentially putting more strain still on the care system. Which is where robots come in. The previous government announced a £34m investment in developing robots that could potentially be used to give care. It went as far as saying, in 2019, that ""within the next 20 years, autonomous systems like… robots will become a normal part of our lives, transforming the way we live, work and travel."" Could this ""techno-solutionism"" - which sounds more like something out of a sci-fi film - really be the solution? And would you really trust your elderly relatives, or yourself when you're at your most vulnerable with what is essentially a very strong machine?

Workouts with Pepper the robot

Japan offers a peek into a future with robots living among us. Ten years ago, its government began offering subsidies to robot manufacturers to develop and popularise the use of robots in care homes - fuelled in part by an ageing population and relative lack of care home staff. Dr James Wright, an AI specialist and visiting professor at Queen Mary University of London, spent seven months observing them. And specifically, looking at how well they worked in a Japanese care home. In all, three types of robots were studied: the first, called HUG, was designed by Fuji Corporation in Japan and looked like a highly sophisticated walking frame. It had support pads that people could lean right into, and it helped carers lift people from bed to, say, a wheelchair or the toilet.

The second, meanwhile, looked a bit like a baby seal and was called Paro. This robot, intended to stimulate dementia patients, was trained to respond to being stroked through movements and sounds. The third was a small friendly-looking humanoid robot called Pepper. It could give instructions and also demonstrate exercises by moving its arms - and was used to lead exercise classes in the care home. Even before he started observing them, Dr Wright had bought into the hype a little. ""I was expecting that the robots would be easily adopted by care workers who were massively overstretched and extremely busy in their work. ""What I found was, almost the opposite.""

Getty Images Pepper could give instructions and demonstrate exercises by moving its arms - but some people who tried it out found its voice too high pitched

He discovered that, in fact, the biggest drain on the time of care home staff was cleaning and recharging the robots - and above all troubleshooting when they went wrong. ""After several weeks the care workers decided the robots were more trouble than they were worth and used them less and less, because they were too busy to use them,"" he tells me. ""HUG had to be moved around all the time to get [it] out of the residents' way. Paro caused distress to one of the residents who had become overly attached to it. And they couldn't follow Pepper's exercise routines because it was too short for people to see - and they couldn't hear it properly because its voice was too high-pitched.""

The The Washington Post via Getty Images Paro looks like a baby seal and is intended to respond through movements and sounds to being stroked

The teams behind the robots had their own responses to Dr Wright's research. The developers behind HUG says that since then they've refined the design to make it more compact and user-friendly. Paro's creator Takanori Shibata said that Paro has been used for 20 years and pointed to trials that demonstrated ""clinical evidence of [the] therapeutic effects"". Pepper is now owned by a different company and its software has been substantially updated. And yet the study was not without merit. Mr Walker of Shadow Robot is adamant that the use of robots in care should not be dismissed. For one thing, he argues, the next generation of them will be much more capable.

From labs to the real world

Praminda Caleb-Solly, a professor at the University of Nottingham is determined to make these robots work well in practice. ""We are trying to get these robots out of the labs into the real world,"" she says. To do this she has set up a network, Emergence, to help connect robot makers with businesses and individuals who will use them - and to find out from elderly people themselves what they'd want from robots. The answers vary. Some people have said they want robots with voice interaction and, understandably, a non-threatening appearance. Others want a ""cute design"". But many requests come down to the practical way they'd like the robot to adapt to their changing needs - and for the robot to charge and clean itself. ""We don't want to look after the robot – we want the robot to look after us,"" said one person who was asked the question.

Caremark Caremark has been trialling Genie - a small voice-activated robot

Some businesses in the UK are testing out robots too. Home care provider, Caremark has been trialling Genie, a small voice-activated robot, with some people who use their services in Cheltenham. One man who has early-onset dementia explained he enjoyed asking Genie to play Glenn Miller songs. Overall, however, reactions have been ""like Marmite,"" according to director Michael Folkes – with some people loving Genie, and others less complimentary. But Mr Folkes also stresses these devices aren't about replacing people. ""We're trying to build a future where carers have more time to care.""

Robot hands: learning from evolution

Back in the laboratory of the Shadow Robot Company in London, Rich Walker points out another big challenge: mastering the perfect robotic hand. ""For the robot to be useful, it needs to have the same ability to interact with the world as [a] human does,"" he explains. ""And for that it needs human-like dexterity.""

Getty Images The previous government announced a £34m investment in developing robots that could potentially give care amongst other things

The robot hand Mr Walker shows me certainly seems nimble. It's made from metal and plastic, and fitted with 100 sensors, with the dexterity and strength of a human hand. Each finger moves to touch its thumb smoothly, quickly and precisely, finishing with an 'OK' to sign off. It can even do a Rubik's Cube, one-handed. Yet it is still a long way from doing the more delicate tasks, like using a pair of scissors or picking up smaller, more fragile objects. ""The way we use a pair of scissors is quite mind-blowing when you think about it,"" Mr Walker says. ""If you try and analyse what happens, you're using your sense of touch in subtle and precise ways and receiving feedback, which makes you adjust the way you cut. How do you tell a robot how to do that?""

Bloomberg via Getty Images 'For the robot to be useful, it needs to have the same ability to interact with the world as [a] human does. And for that it needs human-like dexterity'

Mr Walker's team, together with 26 other engineering firms, are working to design a hand more like ours - it's part of what's known as the Robot Dexterity Programme. It's one of the projects run by a government agency called the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) that sets out to support scientific research that is high risk (because it might well not work) but also high-reward for its potential to transform society. The project's leader, Professor Jenny Read, explains they are looking at how animals move as part of this, to better inform the design not only of the hand but to inform a complete rethink of how robots are made. ""One of the very striking things about animal bodies is their grace and efficiency, evolution has ensured that, in fact. ""I think gracefulness really is a form of efficiency.""

Replicating human muscles

Guggi Kofod, an engineer turned entrepreneur from Denmark, is trying to develop artificial muscles for robots that can be used instead of motors. His Denmark-based firm, Pliantics, is at an early stage of development, but have made the key breakthrough of finding a material that seems to do the job and is durable. He is driven by deeply personal reasons too. ""Several people near me died from dementia very recently,"" he explains. ""I see from the people who are caring for dementia patients, and it is very challenging. ""So, if we could build systems that help them to not be scared, and that help them live at least a decent level of life… That's incredibly motivating for me.""

The muscles his firm designs are made from a soft material that extends and contracts, much like real muscles, when an electric current is applied. Guggi Kofod is working with Shadow Robot, as part of the ARIA project to develop a robotic human-sized hand whose artificial muscles could give it a more precise and delicate grip. The ultimate aim is for it to detect small pressure changes when it grips an object, and to know when to stop squeezing, just as the skin on fingertips does.

What robots mean for carers

Dr Wright, who observed the robots in Japan, has one final concern. That is, if they catch on, robots could end up making life worse for human carers. ""The only way that economically you can make this work is to pay the care workers less and have much larger care homes, which are standardised to make it easy for robots to operate in,"" he argues. ""As a result, there would be more robots taking care of people, with care workers being paid a minimum wage to service the robots, which is the opposite of this vision that robots are going to give time back to care workers to spend quality time with residents, to talk."" The debate: Are facial recognition cameras in shops a step too far? Other experts are more positive. ""It's going to be a huge industry, given the deficit we have in the workforce right now. The demand for carers as our population ages will be huge,"" argues Gopal Ramchurn, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Southampton. He is also CEO of Responsible AI, which is involved in trying to ensure that artificial intelligence systems are safe, reliable, and trustworthy. But he cites Elon Musk's Optimus humanoid robot, which served drinks and mingled at a Tesla event last year, as a sign that - like it or not - the robots are coming. ""We are trying to anticipate that future, before the big tech companies come in and deploy these things without asking us what we think about them,"" he adds. So now is the time to develop the right regulations to ensure that the robots work for us, he argues, rather than the other way round. ""We need to be ready for that future.""

When you see the 5G symbol at the top of your phone, you probably assume you're getting faster internet speeds - the kind promised when it first arrived five years ago.

Mobile networks told us that 5G would provide us with faster downloads, smoother streaming and instant connectivity.

It has received lots of investment from mobile operators and the government but has faced several setbacks, particularly as 5G requires a lot of masts because it delivers faster speeds over shorter distances.

New research suggests that the 5G symbol you see on your screen might not match what you're actually getting in terms of internet speed.

Tests carried out by research group PolicyTracker, and shared with BBC's Morning Live, found that nearly 40% of the time a phone displays the 5G symbol, it is actually using a 4G connection.

That means you could be paying for, and seeing, 5G while your phone quietly sticks to slower speeds.

The peak theoretical download speed for 5G is up to 20,000 megabits per second which is fast enough to download 18 HD films in under a minute, but for many of us our speed is far lower than that.

The research comes as some mobile networks begin rolling out ""standalone 5G"" - a new service that, they say, promises true 5G speeds all the time.

In order to benefit from this you will need to purchase a specific phone plan which often comes with a higher price tag.",2025-11-14T17:18:12.754075

BBC The strike is about the right of the main union to negotiate pay and conditions for all its members

In Sweden 70 car mechanics are continuing to take on one of the world's richest companies – Tesla. The strike at the US carmaker's 10 Swedish service centres has now reached its second anniversary, and there is little prospect of a resolution. Janis Kuzma has been on the Tesla picket line since October 2023. ""It's a tough time,"" says the 39-year-old. And as Sweden's cold winter weather sets in, it's likely to become tougher. Janis spends each Monday with a colleague, standing outside a Tesla garage on an industrial park in Malmö. His union, IF Metall, provides accommodation in the form of a mobile builders' van, as well as coffee and sandwiches. But it's business as usual across the road, where the workshop appears to be in full swing. The strike concerns an issue that goes to the heart of Swedish industrial culture - the right of trade unions to negotiate pay and conditions on behalf of their members. This concept of collective agreement has underpinned industrial relations in Sweden for nearly a century.

Janis Kuzma says that the ongoing strike has not been easy

Today some 70% of Swedish workers are members of a trade union, and 90% are covered by a collective agreement. Strikes in Sweden are rare. It's an arrangement welcomed across the board. ""We prefer the right to negotiate freely with the unions and sign collective agreements,"" says Mattias Dahl of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise business organisation. But Tesla has upset the apple cart. Outspoken chief executive Elon Musk has said he ""disagrees"" with the idea of unions. ""I just don't like anything which creates a kind of lords and peasants sort of thing,"" he told an audience in New York in 2023. ""I think the unions try to create negativity in a company."" Tesla came to Sweden back in 2014, and IF Metall has long wanted to secure a collective agreement with the company. ""But they wouldn't respond,"" says Marie Nilsson, the union's president. ""And we got the impression that they tried to hide away or not discuss this with us."" She says the union eventually saw no other option than to announce a strike, which started on 27 October, 2023. ""Usually it's enough to make the threat,"" says Ms Nilsson. ""The company usually signs the agreement."" But not in this case.

Union boss Marie Nilsson says that the industrial action was the last option

Janis Kuzma, who is originally from Latvia, started working for Tesla in 2021. He claims that pay and conditions were often dependent on the whim of managers. He recalls a performance review at which he says he was refused an annual pay rise because he was ""not reaching Tesla's goals"". Meanwhile, a colleague was said to have been turned down for a pay rise because he had the ""wrong attitude"". However, not everyone went out on strike. Tesla had some 130 mechanics working at the time the industrial action was called. IF Metall says that today around 70 of its members are on strike. Tesla has long since replaced these with new workers, for which there is no precedent since the 1930s. ""Tesla has done it [found replacement staff] openly and systematically,"" says German Bender, a researcher at Arena Idé, a think tank financed by Swedish trade unions. ""It's not illegal, which is important to understand. But it goes against all established norms. But Tesla doesn't care about norms. ""They want to be norm breakers. So if somebody tells them, hey, you are breaking a norm, they see that as a compliment.""

The BBC asked to speak to Tesla's subsidiary, TM Sweden, but the request was declined in an email citing ""all-time high deliveries"". Indeed, the company has given only one media interview in the two years since the strike began. In March 2024, TM Sweden's ""country lead"", Jens Stark, told the business paper Dagens Industri that it suited the company better not to have a collective agreement, and instead ""to work closely with the team and give them the best possible conditions"". Mr Stark denied that the decision not to enter a collective agreement was one made at Tesla headquarter in the US. ""We have a mandate to make our own such decisions,"" he said. IF Metall is not entirely alone in its fight. The strike has been supported by a number of other unions. Dockworkers in neighbouring Denmark, Norway and Finland, are refusing to handle Teslas; rubbish is no longer collected from Tesla's Swedish facilities; and newly built charging stations are not being connected to the grid in the country. There is one such facility near Stockholm Arlanda Airport, where 20 chargers stand idle. But Tibor Blomhäll, the president of enthusiasts group Tesla Club Sweden, says Tesla owners are unaffected by the strike. ""There's another charging station 10km (six miles) from here,"" he says. ""And we can still buy our cars, we can service our cars, we can charge our cars.""

Ventrica South Africa's outsourcing sector, including accountancy support and call centres, is growing strongly

Esethu Dywili says his lucrative accountancy work has given him the chance to change his family's life. The 31-year-old has spent a number of years working in South Africa's fast-growing outsourced financial services sector. An outsourced services company is one, often based in a poorer country, which does work for other businesses, typically big firms in Europe and North America. Examples include call-centres in the Philippines, IT operations in India, and South African companies that offer auditing and other finance work. Back in 2022, Mr Dywili had earned enough money to build a new house for his parents and siblings. They live in a village in the country's Eastern Cape province, an 11-hour drive from Johannesburg, where Mr Dywili now resides. ""When you work for a firm that earns its revenue in US dollars or British pounds, they are able to pay competitive salaries that perhaps you would not get working for a local South African company,"" says Mr Dywili, who has a degree in commerce and accounting.

Carving out a career in South Africa's booming outsourced services industry is not something to be taken lightly when you consider the country's unemployment rate is around 33%, one of the highest in the world. South Africa's growing popularity as an outsourcing destination has been fueled by a number of factors. Firms in countries such as the UK have been moving work abroad due to both a drive to cut costs, and a reported lack of available UK staff in sectors such as accountancy. With salaries in South Africa around half of those in the UK, the country's outsourced services industry has developed a niche in financial services, along with IT and software development, data analytics and digital marketing. English language proficiency, a high level of education, and a time difference of just one or two hours with the UK also appeal to big companies. ""There's just such a great work ethic in South Africa, and an energy about South Africans,"" says Simon Wheeler, a Durban-based chartered accountant who also works in the sector. ""We're go-getters and give 110% to everything. So South Africans are really grabbing these opportunities with both hands, and taking full advantage of them. ""It now gives them that opportunity to take their career to new heights, and get that experience whilst in the country, as traditionally, it always used to be that you would have to relocate outside of South Africa to get that international experience.""

Esethu Dywili Accountant Esethu Dywili has earned enough to build his parents a new home

The outsourcing sector now contributes 35bn rand ($2bn; £1.5bn) to the South African economy per year, according to figures from the Western Cape regional government. Nezaam Joseph is chief director in the Department of Economic Development for the Western Cape government, where around 60 outsourcing firms are based. The department has been one of the earliest supporters of the sector, says Mr Joseph. Around six years ago, it began offering outsourced services firms in the province 3,500 South African rand per month, as part of a subsidised training programme for around 4,500 people a year. It says that around 80% of those people have gone on to be hired by firms full time. Mr Joseph says that more than 70,000 people are now employed in the Cape to service the outsourced needs of overseas companies. ""We added about 10,000 jobs last year, and another 10,000 plus jobs this year. Fifteen years ago, we had less than 2,000 offshore jobs.""

UK accountancy firm Cooper Parry is one British company that has outsourced work to South Africa. It turned to South African outsourcing finance firms Makosi and PKF Octagon to fill hundreds of roles during the Covid-19 pandemic. Gemma Edwards, a partner at Cooper Parry and its head of transformation and business services, says the company was so impressed with its South African partners that it recently opened an office of its own in the country. This now has 60 team members, including both Mr Dywili and Mr Wheeler. Ms Edwards says the South African employees ""have become an extension of our UK teams"". She adds: ""They join the same calls as us… it's not them and us - we're one global team."" UK call-centre firm Ventrica, which works with brands such as shoemaker Clarks and McDonald's, opened an operation in South Africa in 2022. Around 30% of its workforce is now based there, with plans to grow this to 40%. Ventrica's chief executive Iain Banks says that its cost-conscious clients are happy for their call-centre operations to be based in South Africa, while others believe that their business is safer remaining in the UK. ""For example, there's a FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods] brand we move with,"" says Mr Banks. ""And if I were to embark on a conversation about South Africa, they would march out the door straight away."" That may change though, as more and more highly educated South Africans enter the industry. That is certainly what Mr Joseph anticipates, as the Western Cape government plans to work more closely with universities to make curriculums a better fit for what outsourcing industry employers need.

Cooper Parry Gemma Edwards says her firm was so impressed by South African workers that it set up its own base there

But Jee-A van der Linde, a Cape Town-based senior economist, is concerned that, despite those ambitions, the South African education system isn't going to be able to keep pace with the outsourcing industry's growth, both in size and in importance to the country. ""The quality of education, from a social perspective, is one of the biggest hindrances for the South African economy, and a big reason for the skills deficit that we have in South Africa,"" he says. He's also concerned that not all opportunities in the South African outsourcing industry are being spread equally across the country. While many jobs could be done remotely, unstable internet connections in rural areas would rule this out. ""South Africa is a relatively big country,"" adds Mr van der Linde. ""You have your major hubs like Johannesburg and Durban, but there are gaps in how different parties govern different provinces. Some have a more business-friendly mindset. ""With those disparities, it's natural you'll likely end up with an imbalance in terms of how the outsourcing industry can actually impact unemployment across the whole country.""",2025-11-14T17:18:16.123300

When Prabowo Subianto campaigned to become Indonesia's new president, he promised dynamic economic growth and major social change. But his first year in office has not lived up to this populist platform. Rather, his ambitious pledges have been confronted by the realities of South East Asia's biggest economy. A frustrated youth, worried about jobs, took to the streets in late August to protest against the rising cost of living, corruption and inequality - the government was forced to roll back the perks for politicians that had triggered public fury. There had been huge protests earlier in the year too, against budget cuts that hit healthcare and education spending. What didn't help was that this coincided with an expensive free school meals programme - at an annual cost of $28bn (£20.8bn). A centrepiece of Prabowo's agenda, it aims to tackle child malnutrition, improve education outcomes and stimulate the economy. Officials describe it as ""an investment in Indonesia's future."" Except, in recent months images have emerged showing weak, dehydrated children - some as young as seven - hooked up to intravenous drips. They were suffering from food poisoning after eating the free lunches With more than 9,000 children falling ill since the scheme was rolled out in January, critics are questioning whether it's delivering at all, or straining public resources while racking up debt. Analysts warn all of these challenges highlight broader issues in public spending and oversight - and those, in turn, point to deeper strains in Indonesia's $1.4tn economy.

Discontent on the streets

It is a critical time for the vast archipelago of more than 280 million people, spread across thousands of islands. Despite steady annual growth of roughly 5% in recent years, Indonesia is feeling the pressure of slowing global demand, rising living costs and competition from regional neighbours like Vietnam and Malaysia. Both of those countries have successfully attracted foreign companies trying to diversify production away from China. The protests in August, which left 10 people dead, captured the extent of public anger over Prabowo's government. Demonstrators accused it of prioritising prestige policies and projects over providing economic support. Prabowo - who has set an ambitious growth target of 8% by 2029 - and his ministers continue to defend their policies, saying they will create jobs and stimulate demand. ""We have an experience of growing beyond 7%. So... Indonesia knows that higher growth is achievable. But of course, we have to see the global economics and the global trade,"" Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto told the BBC. Experts say that achieving such growth will require careful management of public finances and foreign investment. A new sovereign wealth fund, Danantara, which is targeting high-impact projects across renewable energy and advanced manufacturing could spur higher growth, said Adam Samdin from advisory firm Oxford Economics.

Getty Images Questions have been raised about President Prabowo Subianto's flagship free school meals plan

Airlangga told the BBC that Indonesia is ""ready"" and willing to ""spend on the right sector of the economy"". But ambitious and challenging commitments like the free school meals programme make some question Prabowo's priorities. Some health-focused non-governmental organisations are urging him to stop the scheme. He defended it last month, saying ""Brazil needed 11 years to reach 47 million beneficiaries. We've reached 30 million in 11 months. We're quite proud of what we've achieved."" Another example is India, which has the world's biggest school lunch programme, feeding nearly 120 million students. But unlike in Brazil and India, the Indonesian programme has been accused of being ineffective, despite its much higher cost, because of the mass food poisonings. Indonesia faces unique challenges. It doesn't have the infrastructure for safe and speedy meal delivery to schools across its 6,000 inhabited islands, Mr Samdin said. That includes proper refrigeration transport, as well as strict food safety standards and resources to enforce them to keep food fresh in the tropical heat. So the government is relying on third parties and contractors for the programme, which makes it even harder to monitor quality. But a flagship programme that is faltering is not Prabowo's only challenge.

The search for investment

US President Donald Trump's trade war has not spared Indonesia, which now faces 19% tariffs on exports to America. Airlangga, who was involved in the negotiations, said he was grateful for a tariff rate that could compete with rivals like Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, and that he expected the US-Indonesia trade deal to be signed by the end of October. But 19% is still a high cost for exporters who will also face pressure from Chinese goods being redirected to Asia to avoid high tariffs in Europe and the US. Indonesia - which is on the search for new markets and partners - also signed a trade deal last month with the European Union, which it had been negotiating for almost 10 years. Airlangga expects trade with the bloc to increase by two and a half times over the next five years. But investment, which has spurred manufacturing and created jobs in countries like Thailand and Vietnam, has become a challenge here. Foreign companies have long complained of red tape and the cost of doing business in Indonesia, but they still came because of the large consumer base and resources. It is flush with nickel and copper, which are integral to electric vehicles and other green technology, and palm oil. But these were not industries that required huge manpower, which meant they never created jobs on the same scale as manufacturing did in countries like China and Vietnam. Airlangga said Indonesia is now investing in the digital economy to create more jobs and boost growth. But whether it can provide enough people with the right skills to staff data centres and other such ventures is the big question.

AFP via Getty Images The Netherlands has raced to switch to wind and solar power

In a Dutch government TV campaign called ""Flip the Switch"" an actress warns viewers about their electricity usage. ""When we all use electricity at the same time, our power grid gets overloaded,"" she says. ""This can cause malfunctions. So, use as little electricity as possible between four and nine."" It is the sign that, in one of the most-advanced economies in the world, something has gone wrong with the country's power supply. The Netherlands has been an enthusiastic adopter of electric cars. It has the highest number of charging points per capita in Europe. As for electricity production, the Netherlands has replaced gas from its large North Sea reserves with wind and solar. So much so that it leads the way in Europe for the number of solar panels per person. In fact, more than one third of Dutch homes have solar panels fitted. The country is also aiming for offshore wind farms to be its biggest source of energy by 2030.

This is all good in environmental terms, but it's putting the Dutch national electricity grid under enormous stress, and in recent years there have been a number of power cuts. The problem is ""grid congestion"", says Kees-Jan Rameau, chief executive of Dutch energy producer and supplier Eneco, 70% of whose electricity generation is now solar and wind. ""Grid congestion is like a traffic jam on the power grid. It's caused by either too much power demand in a certain area, or too much power supply put onto the grid, more than the grid can handle."" He explains that the problem is that the grid ""was designed in the days when we had just a few very large, mainly gas-fired power plants"". ""So we built a grid with very big power lines close to those power plants, and increasingly smaller power lines as you got more towards the households. ""Nowadays we're switching to renewables, and that means there's a lot of power being injected into the grid in the outskirts of the network where there are only relatively small power lines."" And these small power lines are struggling to cope with all the electricity coming in from wind turbines and solar panels scattered around the country.

AFP via Getty Images More than one in three Dutch homes has solar panels

Damien Ernst, professor of electrical engineering at Belgium's Liege University, is one of Europe's leading experts on electricity grids. He says it is an expensive problem for the Netherlands to solve. ""They have a grid crisis because they haven't invested enough in their distribution networks, in their transmission networks, so they are facing bottlenecks everywhere, and it will take years and billions of dollars to solve this."" Prof Ernst adds that it is a Europe-wide issue. ""We have an enormous amount of solar panels being installed, and they are installed at a rate that is much, much too high for the grid to be able to accommodate.""

At Eneco's headquarters in Rotterdam, Mr Kees-Jan Rameau highlights a large control panel that the company calls its ""virtual power plant"" and ""the brain of our operations"". It is used to help balance the grid, avoiding blackouts. When electricity generation is too high across the Netherlands, it enables Eneco to turn wind turbines out of the wind and turn off solar panels. As for when demand for electricity is too high, it lowers the power to customers who have accepted to allow Eneco to stop or reduce their electricity supply when the network is under strain in exchange for lower prices. But for homes and companies who want to scale-up their use of electricity with a new or larger grid connection, that, increasingly, is just not possible. ""Often consumers want to install a heat pump, or charge their electric vehicle at home, but that requires a much bigger power connection, and increasingly they just cannot get it,"" says Mr Kees-Jan Rameau. He adds that it is worse for businesses. ""Often they want to expand their operations, and they just cannot get extra capacity from the grid operators. And it has got to the point where even new housing construction in the Netherlands is becoming increasingly difficult, because there's just no capacity to connect those new neighbourhoods to the grid."" Those people, and companies, end up on waiting lists for a number of years. At the same time there are also waiting lists for those who want to supply the grid with power, such as a new home fitted with solar panels on its roof.

Energy firm Eneco can remotely reduce the amount of electricity generated by its wind farms

Tennet, the government-owned agency that runs the Netherlands' national grid, says that 8,000 companies are currently waiting to be able to feed in electricity, while 12,000 others are waiting for permission to use more power. Some sectors of the Dutch economy are warning that it is hampering their growth. ""Grid congestion is putting the future of the Dutch chemical industry at risk… while in other countries it will be easier to invest,"" says the president of the Dutch Chemical Association Nienke Homan. So, was all this avoidable? ""In hindsight I think almost every problem is avoidable,"" says Mr Kees-Jan Rameau. He adds that following the 2015 Paris Agreement on trying to tackle climate change, ""we were very much focussing on increasing the renewable power generation side. But we kind of underestimated the impact it would have on the power grid."" Tennet is now planning to spend €200bn ($235bn; £174bn) on reinforcing the grid, including laying some 100,000km (62,000 miles) of new cables between now and 2050. That's a huge amount of money, but there is also a big cost to not spending it. Grid congestion is costing the Dutch economy up to €35bn a year, according to a 2024 report from management consultancy group Boston Consulting Group. Eugene Baijings, who is in charge of grid congestion with Tennet, says that patience is sadly required. ""To strengthen and reinforce the grid, we need to double, triple, sometimes increase tenfold the capacity of the existing grid. ""And it's taking on average about 10 years to do a project like that before it goes live, of which the first eight are legislation and getting the rights to put cables in the ground with all property owners. And only the last two years are the construction period. ""And meanwhile the energy transition is going that fast that we cannot cope with it, with the existing grid. So every additional request [to connect] is adding to the waiting list.""

Chancellor Rachel Reeves is widely expected to announce some tax rises in the Budget on 26 November. Expectations had been growing that the chancellor would increase income tax rates in the Budget, partly offsetting them with cuts to National Insurance, but the BBC understands she has decided against this. Labour pledged before the 2024 election that it would not increase income tax, National Insurance (NI) or VAT for working people. However, there could still be announcements in the Budget that affect thresholds - the level at which people have to start paying certain rates of tax. These are the current rules, rates and thresholds. What might be in the 26 November Budget?

What is National Insurance and what does it pay for?

The government uses National Insurance to pay benefits and help fund the NHS. It is paid by employees, employers and the self-employed across the UK. Those over the state pension age do not pay it, even if they are working. Eligibility for some benefits, including the state pension, depends on the National Insurance contributions (NICs) you make across your working life. It may be possible to make voluntary payments to fill gaps in your contribution history. How does National Insurance work?

How much do employees currently pay in National Insurance?

The type and amount of NI you pay depends on your age, employment status and income. Workers start paying NI when they turn 16 and earn more than £242 a week, or have self-employed profits of more than £12,570 a year. The amount owed is usually deducted automatically from employees' wages along with income tax. The starting rate for NI for employees fell twice in 2024: from 12% to 10%, and then again to 8%. The previous Conservative government said these cuts were worth about £900 a year for a worker earning £35,000. For the self-employed, the rate of NI paid on all earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 fell from 9% to 6%. This was said to be worth £350 to a self-employed person earning £28,200. Most self-employed people pay their NICs through their self assessment tax return. The NI rate on income and profits above £50,270 is 2% for all workers. National Insurance rates and categories

How much do employers currently pay in National Insurance?

Since April 2025, employers pay NI at 15% on most employees' wages above £5,000. They previously paid 13.8% on salaries above £9,100. Businesses also pay 15% NI on expenses and benefits they give to their staff - such as company cars or health insurance. The employment allowance - the amount employers can claim back from their NI bill - rose from £5,000 to £10,500. National Insurance rates and thresholds for employers

What are the current income tax rates?

You have to pay income tax on your earnings from employment, or profits from self-employment, above the tax-free personal allowance of £12,570. Income tax is also paid on some benefits and pensions, income from renting out property, and returns from savings and investments above certain limits.

The basic rate of 20% is paid on annual earnings between £12,571 and £50,270. The higher rate of 40% is paid on earnings between £50,271 and £125,140. Once you earn more than £100,000, you also start losing the £12,570 tax-free personal allowance. You lose £1 of your personal allowance for every £2 that your income goes above £100,000. Anyone earning more than £125,140 a year no longer has any tax-free personal allowance. They also pay an additional rate of income tax of 45% on all earnings above that amount. These rates apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some income tax rates are different in Scotland, where a new 45% band took effect in April 2024. At the same time the top rate also rose from 47% to 48%. Check your income tax code and personal allowances for the current year

Described as the biggest shake-up to renting in England for more than 30 years, a new law giving tenants more rights was formally approved at the end of October. The government has now confirmed that the main changes will come into force from 1 May 2026. The new rules will affect more than 11 million people.

How long will I be able to rent a home for?

From 1 May, properties will be rented on a ""periodic"" or rolling basis, rather than under a fixed 12 or 24-month contract. It means that tenants who wish to remain can do so, which the government says will provide greater security. Tenants who want to leave can give two months' notice, rather than being tied in for a year or longer. The government says this will end ""the injustice of tenants being trapped paying rent for substandard properties"". The Renters' Rights Bill - now known as the Renters' Rights Act - applies to England. Scotland has had periodic agreements for tenancies since 2017, but Wales and Northern Ireland still allow fixed-term contracts. Guide to the Renters' Rights Bill

Will a landlord be able to evict me for no reason?

In the year to June 2025, more than 11,000 households in England had their homes repossessed by bailiffs following a Section 21 ""no-fault"" eviction. The new law means that a landlord will not be able to sell or move into a property in the first 12 months after a tenancy begins, from 1 May. After this, they will need to give four months' notice. However, it will still be possible for landlords to evict tenants in certain circumstances. If tenants damage the property, commit antisocial behaviour, or fall significantly behind paying the rent - known as rent arrears - the landlord can give notice at any point. Tenants will need to owe three months' rent rather than two to trigger an arrears eviction. Under the new rules, if a tenant does not leave after the four months' notice period, a court will decide whether to order possession of the property. Landlords will also no longer be able to evict tenants for complaining about poor conditions. In a later phase at a date yet to be confirmed, a ""Decent Homes Standard"" will be introduced, and the new ""Awaab's Law"" will take effect. Named after two-year-old Awaab Ishak who died after being exposed to mould in 2020 in his Rochdale home, this will require hazards to be repaired within a certain timeframe.

When can a landlord increase my rent?

Landlords will need to give two months' notice, and can only increase rent to ""the market rate"". If a tenant believes the amount is excessive, they can challenge the landlord at a first-tier tribunal, a type of civil court. The Act will also end the practice of ""bidding wars"", so new tenants cannot be asked to pay more than the advertised price. The changes come as average UK monthly private rents increased by 5.5% to £1,354 in the 12 months to September 2025, according to a provisional estimate by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

How much deposit will I have to pay?

There are no changes to the rules of the protected deposit schemes currently operating in England to cover potential damages. The maximum a landlord can ask for to cover potential damages remains: five weeks' rent - if the rent for the year is less than £50,000

six weeks' rent if the yearly rent is £50,000 or more However, landlords will only be able to request one month's rent in advance to secure a tenancy - or 28 days' rent for tenancies with rental periods of less than one month.

What if I receive benefits or have children?

It will be illegal for landlords and agents to discriminate against prospective tenants who receive benefits or who have children. However, landlords and agents will still be able to do reference and affordability checks before selecting a tenant.

Can I have a pet in a rented home?

Getty Images

A landlord must consider a request to have a pet and cannot ""unreasonably"" refuse. Tenants will be able to challenge unfair decisions. Landlords will be able to require pet insurance to cover any damage to their property.

How are rules changing for student accommodation?

Tenants in purpose-built student accommodation can be given two weeks' notice to leave. This rule applies to specific institutional providers such as university-owned accommodation or companies renting to students. If a private landlord has been renting a house of multiple occupation to students - where the tenancy was agreed at a maximum six months before the tenancy started - landlords can evict them to allow for new tenancies. All the residents on the contract need to be students and the landlord needs to give four months' notice.

BBC Emma and Mike, from North Yorkshire, said they had always planned to adopt

A couple who adopted two children earlier this year have urged others to consider adoption too, amid concerns over the falling number of people coming forward to do so. The Adoption Matters charity said it believed the cost of living may have contributed to a 12% drop in adoption registrations in England in 2025 compared to 2024. Emma and Mike, from North Yorkshire, adopted their children - a brother and sister - in January after they had previously been in foster care for two and a half years. Emma said: ""There's so much loveliness in them being together and knowing they will always have each other - and we've just got the joy of being able to join in with that dynamic.""

""It feels slightly heartbreaking that they had waited so long to find that forever family,"" Emma said. ""Adoption is intimidating. It can be overwhelming - but so is parenting generally.""

Family handout Emma and Mike adopted a brother and sister at the start of 2025

Emma and Mike said they were passionate about sharing the message that adoption was not a secondary option. ""We don't want people to think that because we're an adoptive family it must be because it's biologically not possible,"" Emma explained. ""That was a factor, but actually, for us, that felt like it was confirming that adopting siblings is how our family is meant to be."" The couple said they had been shown videos of the children before meeting them at an ""adoption activity day"" where prospective parents were introduced to children. ""We hadn't spotted them yet, but Emma heard our son's giggle from across the room and it was really special getting to spend time with them,"" explained Mike. ""Emma turned to me and said, 'they have my heart', and it was just that moment where we thought, 'we're all in now, this is it'."" Emma and Mike said they wanted to share their story in the hope it would encourage more prospective parents to find out about adoption. ""The graph is going the wrong way,"" said Emma. ""The number of children needing a safe and forever family is increasing, while the number of people even willing to consider adoption is decreasing.""

Family handout Emma said it had been an ""absolutely wild"" time since adopting the siblings

The most recent figures showed that in the Yorkshire and Humber region there were 390 children waiting for an adoptive family. Jacqui Shore, from Adoption Matters, told the BBC that more families were ""desperately needed"". ""Traditionally in adoption we've seen peaks and troughs, but I don't think we've ever seen the cost of living quite as it is at the moment,"" she said. ""Local authorities are struggling for money, so in the past some older children or sibling groups might have attracted an adoption allowance from the local authority, but that's not always there anymore."" Emma and Mike said their experience of adoption had been very positive, with Emma saying they had not looked back since adopting their children 10 months ago. ""It's been absolutely wild, we've done so much learning,"" Emma said. ""We had a trickier start than was expected, but actually we've just really cemented ourselves as that safe place and that we're a forever family - we're not going anywhere. ""There's just been a whole lot of laughter. Lots of tears, too, but that's what makes us feel like a regular family.""",2025-11-14T17:18:27.110293

BBC

Listen to Faisal read this article There has been more than a bitter twang in the glasses at British breakfast tables. Only five years ago, a typical supermarket own-label carton of orange juice could be bought for 76p for 1 litre. It now costs £1.79. That's a rise of 134% since 2020, and it's up 29% just in the past year. In cafes and restaurants it's a similar story - with £3.50 to £4 now a standard price point for a glass of basic OJ. One colleague was outraged to be sent a bill for £9 for a glass of hangover-busting orange juice and lemonade at an unassuming little restaurant in Kent. Asked why so much, she was told that the orange juice - albeit freshly squeezed - accounted for £5.30 of the price. Yet as costs have surged, the taste is changing too, with certain manufacturers substituting oranges for mandarins to cut costs. The public is, if you like, being freshly squeezed.

There are all sorts of reasons for this: disease among crops, extreme weather, over-reliance on supply from a single nation, new rules for packaging and complexities around trade wars and Brexit. All of this is compounded by grocery price inflation which, after hitting 17.5% in 2023, came down (to around 5.7% in August) but is rising once again. Plus new figures for overall inflation released today put it at 3.8% - marking the 12th month in a row it is above the Bank of England’s 2% target. It is a perfect storm. Yet the problem is not isolated to orange juice - track the prices of all sorts of other groceries in supermarket aisles and you'll see a similar pattern. And so understanding what has happened to orange juice offers a glimpse into how our overall grocery bills suddenly seem so expensive. It all prompts the question: is this storm a passing one, or are prices set to remain stubbornly high - and should we brace for them staying that way permanently?

The Bing Crosby effect

Where else to start but in the orange groves of Florida where the industrialisation of OJ began as an initiative of the US Army during World War Two. The US government was seeking a source of transportable Vitamin C for troops that didn't taste like turpentine.

Hulton Archive/Getty Images Orange juice from concentrate was commercialised by Minute Maid

Orange juice is nearly 90% water. So gently evaporating the water off the juice and freezing the concentrate allowed for transportability of a much-better-tasting product when water was later re-added. WW2 ended before the troops got to try it, but it ended up being commercialised by what became the American soft drink giant, Minute Maid. It was popularised by Bing Crosby, who, as a significant shareholder, would sing in ads and radio show jingles about frozen orange juice being ""better for your health"". Western consumption of orange juice surged.

Flash forward to today and an estimated 2.5 billion gallons of orange juice are drunk each year - with about a tenth of that in the UK, where the market is still growing.

Drought, disease and flooding

At an industrial unit in the Essex town of Basildon, green steel drums of frozen orange concentrate arrive from Brazil, overseen by Maxim McDonald. His firm Gerald McDonald and Co is named after his great-grandfather, a pioneer who was importing orange concentrate as far back as the 1940s from what was then British-mandate Palestine. Today it produces juices and blends them, then sells them to supermarkets and restaurant suppliers. But prices reached extraordinary heights in global markets, rising from $1(75p) to $1.50 (£1.12) per lb over the last decade, to a record $5.30 per lb by the end of last year. This followed five years of poor crops, owing to severe drought and a disease called citrus greening (caused by bacteria spread by insects). Brazil had its worst crop since 1988. In some parts of its citrus belt, two thirds of orange trees are affected.

""Around September of last year the price shot up to crazy levels,"" Maxim tells me. ""At the worst time I was being offered $7 a kilo. ""For such a major commodity to go from $2 to $7 is insane, but it took a while to filter through to consumers."" Until 2023 the rise in orange juice prices was disguised among food inflation in general, explains Philip Coverdale, an industry expert at consultancy firm GlobalData. Producers have tried to look beyond South America but it's not easy - the supply of oranges has been sewn up by Brazil, even more so than, say, the Saudis have cornered the market for crude oil. Morocco, Egypt and South Africa grow oranges too but their supplies are more limited. Spain also grows them, but Valencia and Seville oranges are mostly exported as fruit, rather than concentrate. (Plus Spain too suffered from weather-related production slumps, including the floods in Valencia last October.)

Even within Brazil the market is concentrated in the hands of huge industrialised conglomerates. In a truly competitive market the price would settle again - but it hasn't, nor does the industry expect it to. This is a phenomenon that is common to many other ordinary groceries too whose prices have risen.

Oranges becoming less sweet

Florida is the other traditional exporter of oranges, but output from the Sunshine State over the past year has been the lowest since the Great Depression, amid a high number of hurricanes and long-term problems caused by citrus greening. One problem with greening is that it reduces sugar content, making oranges less sweet. ""Not many are buying Florida oranges any more unless it is a requirement to label the juice 'Florida Orange',"" says Maxim McDonald. ""It's very difficult to get oranges out of Florida [because of the shortages] and it's too expensive.""

One of the leading suppliers to Tropicana sold off some of its land earlier this year to build homes. Tropicana itself, the marquee US brand for orange juice, had to restructure its debts this year. Pepsi has also sold most of its stake in it. One of Tropicana's recent product innovations in the US has been to launch an ""essentials"" brand of orange juice ""blends"" - combining orange, apple and pear juice - at a lower price. Similar trends can be seen on British shelves. Orange is being mixed with mango, mandarins and clementine juice. Mango purée is especially cheap right now, driven by a good harvest in India. Mandarin concentrate, meanwhile, is cheaper than its orange equivalent because there is less demand for it. These developments save money, but also maintain the traditional sweetness of the taste.

Tariffs: War on the orange

Then there is the added impact of the recent spike in trade tensions with the US since President Trump introduced new tariffs. Oranges, it transpires, have been at the centre of it. US exports of orange juice to Canada have slumped to a 20-year low after Canada put counter-tariffs on US exports. The former PM Justin Trudeau warned that Canadians might have to ""forgo Florida orange juice"". The Trump administration has also settled on a 10% tariff on orange juice coming from Brazil, which will feed into US supermarket prices. In 2024, the UK eliminated tariffs on some imports produced from fruit grown outside Britain. But tariffs on certain sweeter, cheaper varieties and blends were not part of this. And while the tariff cuts might have helped, they were vastly outweighed by the increase in the underlying price.

Then there are new regulations around packaging, further adding to the pressures. The rules, known as Extended Producer Responsibility, are aimed at improving recycling rates, with a weight-based fee. All juice producers will be impacted, especially those still using glass bottles. In August a Bank of England report said that high food price inflation is driven partly - and among other things - by these regulations.

Did the West fall out of love with OJ?

In Brazil, the orange harvest has recovered somewhat - this is the greatest hope for a return to normal prices. Yet it coincides with sinking demand: global consumption of orange juice is now down 30% from a peak two decades ago. Though this may be partly down to the high prices, in certain parts of the world there has also been a shift in perception about the sugar content and health benefits or otherwise of fruit juice. ""When young children are not regularly given juice from an early age, they are less likely to be regular juice drinkers in later years,"" suggests Philip Coverdale at GlobalData. Demand is increasing in countries with growing middle classes, such as China, South Africa, and India. But elsewhere other more exotic fruit juices such as mango, pear and pomegranate are growing in popularity.

Ultimately, however, orange juice is a staple that supermarkets have long been used to selling at low prices. And the price spikes to £2 a carton could, with for example better weather, simply reverse. ""The volatility in the harvest appears to have reduced,"" says Giles Hurley, UK CEO of Aldi, ""Our buying team are doing everything they can to ensure that that saving is passed on to consumers.""

Others in the supply chain are less convinced, given that much of the frozen concentrate was bought at last year's high prices. Plus, the stranglehold of the small number of giant producers who control the market remains. As for the citrus greening, some major commercial producers, including Coca-Cola, which owns Minute Maid and Innocent, have contributed to a project to Save the Orange, using artificial intelligence to find a way to combat it. It's a long-term project - and even if fruitful, it may be some time before the effect - if at all - filters through to grocery bills. But the story of orange prices does also show how an upward price shock gets transmitted around the world far more quickly than a downward one.

Chocolate, coffee, butter and beef

Oranges are not the only food that has seen a price spike, of course. The price of beef and veal is up almost 25% in a year. Butter is up almost 19%, and chocolate and coffee 15% and milk over 12%, all according to the Office for National Statistics. This all suggests that, more generally, there may be something else at play. And that for all the food and drink spikes, the consumer was actually protected from the worst of it for a period - and now it is pay back time. ""It might be the retailers didn't full pass through the cost increase in the first place and therefore it's a way of recouping some of the margin they would otherwise have got,"" says Steve McCorriston, Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Exeter.

EPA - EFE/REX/ Shutterstock Do consumers need to simply accept the fact that the UK will be increasingly exposed to food price shocks?

Ultimately, though, trying to unpick the precise reason for why our food and drink costs what it does is very difficult - other factors that influence price can go undetected. ""What we don't know much about is how these supply chains tend to work in practice. It's difficult to uncover relationships between retailers and manufacturers or farmers and the use of contracts."" There is also a broader question that goes well beyond orange juice: do consumers in the UK need to simply accept the fact that as a densely populated small country with limited agriculture, a changing climate means the UK will be increasingly exposed to food price shocks? A 2024 government report on food security noted: ""The UK continues to be highly dependent on imports to meet consumer demand for fruit, vegetables and seafood... ""Many of the countries the UK imports these foods from are subject to their own climate-related challenges and sustainability risks."" And so it could be that this is only the start of a wild ride on what we pay for our food and drink.

Buenos Aires, September 2023. Hundreds of people crowded around to wave flags and film on their phones. The man with unruly hair and sideburns in the centre of them, clad in a black leather jacket, hoisted a roaring chainsaw above his head. This was an election rally taking place in the San Martín area of the Argentine capital a month before the presidential election - and the metaphor was explicit. The candidate Javier Milei believed the state was far too bloated, with annual debts that were bigger than Argentina's entire annual economic output. Rather than 'trimming the fat', as some politicians delicately put it, he said he would take a chainsaw to ministries, subsidies and the ruling political class he derided as ""la casta"" - the caste.

Getty Images Javier Milei's election rallies featured an unusual prop

Milei had form for stunts. In 2019, he dressed up in a ""libertarian superhero"" costume, purporting to be from Liberland - a land where no taxes are paid. In 2018, he smashed a piñata of the Central Bank on live television. According to official data, inflation in 2023 topped 211% annually - Milei took office in December of that year. Roughly 40% of the population lived in poverty. Years of high public spending, and a reliance on printing more money and borrowing to cover deficits, had left the country in a cycle of debts and inflation. Yet nearly two years on, the headline figures are vastly different: Argentina recorded its first fiscal surplus in 14 years and inflation, which had hit triple figures annually, has tumbled to roughly 36%. The UK Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch called the measures Milei has taken a ""template"" for a future Conservative government. And in the US, President Donald Trump described Milei as ""my favourite president"". They will meet in Washington on Tuesday.

Reuters Donald Trump has described Milei as 'my favourite president' - they are due to meet at the White House later today

Foreign investors regained confidence in Argentina too. Although that recently slipped, Washington's decision last week to swap $20bn (£15bn) in dollars for pesos, effectively propping up Argentina's currency with International Monetary Fund (IMF) backing, is a sign Milei's fiscal shock therapy has appeased international lenders. Trump and Milei's meeting will hail the deal. Yet for all the international praise, this is just one side of the story. On the streets there have been heated protests over Milei's reforms, with police firing tear gas, rubber bullets and a water cannon during clashes. ""He said in his campaign that this adjustment would be paid for by 'la casta' – the wealthy, the politicians, the evil businessmen,"" says Mercedes D'Alessandro, a left-wing economist and senate candidate. But, she argues, the result was less money for pensioners and hospitals. ""The adjustment in the end was directed at the working classes, not the caste.""

Reuters Milei's reforms have prompted heated protests

Milei's critics argue that the price of his changes have been recession, job losses, weaker public services and declining household budgets. And now some economists say the country could be about to enter a recession. Milei has created a paradox. On paper, his chainsaw has achieved some of the macroeconomic successes he set out to do. But Milei has lost political support and that has spooked the markets, which in turn has destabilised his economic project. With midterm elections looming on 26 October, Argentina is about to deliver its verdict: will Milei be punished for doing what he set out to do — and could losing political support completely unravel his economic gains?

Argentines feeling the cost

Around 700 miles from the capital in the Misiones province, tea farmer Ygor Sobol looks anxious. ""We're all going backwards economically,"" he says. ""I had to close the payroll. Now I am completely without employees."" For three generations his family has grown yerba mate, a drink popular with Argentines, but since Milei deregulated his industry by scrapping minimum prices, he says that his crops have become worth less than the cost of producing them. Now, Mr Sobol says he can't afford to do basic tasks like cleaning and fertilising his plantation. And with the business making a loss, he's deciding what his family will have to go without too.

Shutterstock For all the international praise since Milei was sworn in (pictured), this is just one side of the story

Argentina's multibillion dollar textile industry is also affected. Luciano Galfione, chairman of a non-profit for the sector Fundacion Pro Tejer, describes ""daily"" closures and job losses. Unlike Trump's approach of raising tariffs to promote ""America First"", Milei cut tariffs and other criteria for imports. ""I have environmental controls, labour controls - we don't pay people $80 (£60) a month, or have 16-hour work days that might be allowed in places like Bangladesh or Vietnam. This creates an unequal playing field,"" Mr Galfione argues. He believes that boosting imports has battered domestic producers. ""Our sector lost more than 10,000 direct jobs. If you add indirect jobs, there are many more.""

Mr Galfione also blames rising costs of utilities, health and schools for reducing the disposable income of average people, and in turn making them less likely to buy clothes. And yet amid it all, Milei is adamant that his measures will improve the lives of ordinary Argentines.

'Everything was a huge mess'

In the run-up to the election Milei had said there was no alternative to big cuts. As well as the soaring inflation, vast government subsidies had kept energy and transport prices down. Public spending was high, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Price controls set fixed prices for certain goods. Argentina, still, owes £31bn in debt to the IMF. ""The demand for public spending was brutal,"" argues Ramiro Castiñeira, an economist at the consultancy Econométrica who supports Milei. ""Society seemed willing to live with so much inflation. Or didn't recognise that inflation was a product of so much public spending.""

EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Opponents of Javier Milei say ordinary people have been left with less disposable income

Inflation ate away the peso currency's purchasing power. Many ordinary Argentines handed over disproportionate sums of pesos to illegal street traders to buy dollars, fearing their money would lose value overnight. ""Everything was a huge mess,"" explains Martin Rapetti, an economics professor at the University of Buenos Aires and executive director of think tank Equilibria. ""People felt money slipping like water through their fingers."" For many economists, drastic change (even if painful) was essential to restore credibility. And Milei promised radical change. He went viral for ripping government ministries such as Culture and Women off a whiteboard while shouting 'afuera!' - 'out!' Among other austerity measures, he halved government ministries, cut tens of thousands of public jobs, slashed budgets including for education, health, pensions and infrastructure, and removed subsidies – spiking utility and transport prices. His initial devaluing of the peso by 50% caused inflation to spike but then it fell as people spent less and demand fell.

'Echoes of Thatcherism'

When I met him in April 2024 at his office, there were sculptures of him with a chainsaw on display and coasters showing Margaret Thatcher's face. Thatcher is loathed by many people in Argentina owing to the Falklands War, but Milei told me he admired her and that she was ""brilliant."" Last month one British newspaper described Milei's own approach as having ""echoes of Thatcherism"". Miguel Boggiano, an economist on Milei's economic advisory board, is full of praise for Milei getting inflation down and reducing the deficit. ""When you bear in mind the starting point, that's a huge accomplishment,"" he says.

Reuters Javier Milei's reforms have drawn comparisons with those of Margaret Thatcher

He believes this will help alleviate poverty in the long-run and enable lower taxes, but also help people to plan their own spending more easily with inflation currently fluctuating less. But Alan Cibils, an independent economist and former professor, warns reduced inflation is only a success if it is sustained over time which he believes will not be the case.

The outsider advantage

Javier Milei is not a career politician. Before becoming president he had two years experience as a deputy in Argentina's Congress. ""Being so detached kind of shields him,"" Prof Rapetti observes, citing a lack of ""signs of empathy in public life"". On 7 September Milei's party lost unexpectedly badly in the Buenos Aires provincial elections. His convoy was pelted with rocks on the campaign trail. The markets panicked: foreign investors sold off pesos and bonds of Argentine government debt.

EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Some observers say Milei displays a lack of empathy towards those affected by cuts

Financial markets had generally supported his economic programme. But the midterm elections were upcoming and the £15bn of debt repayments are due next year. Trump's £15bn currency swap lifeline has provided some stability: Argentine bonds and the peso rose in value in response to the announcement. But D'Alessandro argues that though US intervention might solve a wider problem, nothing will change in ""people's real lives"". ""We're going to continue with no investment in hospitals, education, social programmes. This money from the United States is not going to improve Argentina's infrastructure.""

Flawed leader or model for other countries?

Some of Milei's supporters - like Mr Boggiano - believe there is something else at play in the round criticism of the president: In this view much of it comes down to the opposition trying to ""break"" what Milei has done, in order to get back into power. ""Once everyone starts to believe stability is here to stay, investment will come back,"" says Mr Boggiano. ""I think Milei will become a model for other countries."" Others are unsure. ""There is some stability which helps things not to explode,"" said Mr Cibils. ""But I think that stability is also a mirage.""

Milei had also kept inflation under control by spending the country's reserves on propping-up the peso so it didn't crash. Meanwhile, Argentina owes $20bn of debt next year. One former central bank economist, who wished to speak anonymously, warns Milei's strategy of keeping inflation down could unravel if Argentina can't pay its debts. ""If at the end of the day we have a financial crisis that partially undoes all the effort, then it's a failure. If it ends with social unrest, any good done will be reversed,"" says the economist. The left-wing governor of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, has been touted as a future presidential candidate, long ahead of the elections in 2027. He has spoken in favour of the welfare state. Some investors are calculating whether this could mean a return to the days of big spending.

As to the question of whether Milei has succeeded, the answer largely depends how you define success - and who it is for. Many workers see shuttered factories, rocketing bills, and a vanishing safety net. Meanwhile, some investors see a success story of fiscal discipline, tamed inflation, an ally in Washington and simply a ""normalisation"". But even as leaders abroad watch Milei's experiment with fascination, politics may explain why few are unlikely to copy it. If normal people lose faith in what he is doing, markets will also lose confidence that his programme is sustainable – and that could wipe out even the 'macro' successes. ""He has no political expertise, and I think you need it,"" Prof Rapetti argues. Still, he believes it is too early to judge: ""We are in the middle of his term… The story hasn't finished.""

Listen to James read this article US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago. Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan ""a stone-cold loser"", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks. All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby. This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception.

There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings. Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real. And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries.

How Windsor became 'Trumpton'

For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents. Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor ""Trumpton"", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show.

Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Detailed planning for the visit has gone on for months, down to banquet menus, seating plans and wording of the King's seven-minute speech

For Palace officials, attention to detail is all. One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry. It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle. There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall. ""The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,"" said one royal insider. ""A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another.""

Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve ""lots of nods to his Scottish heritage"". King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines. Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech.

'Pressure to make this massive'

So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task. The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf. ""There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,"" one courtier told me.

The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.) For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows. One Whitehall source said: ""The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV."" Another said: ""It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason.""

The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests

Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world ""the fullest honour British protocol allows"" will be watched closely by the rest of the world. ""This state visit is not just a UK-US event,"" he said. ""It will be one of the biggest stories around the world. ""The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing."" Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed. They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong.

""Trump can be quite funny in private,"" said one diplomat. ""He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate."" For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain.

Serious business behind the pageantry

Beyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers. Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation. The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing. This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as ""my personal pride and joy"", that he claimed would ""help write the next chapter of the special relationship"". All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic ""wins"" to help promote the government's growth agenda.

The visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine. Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking. ""Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,"" Hunt said. ""What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil.""

Sophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China. ""We are moving into a new phase,"" she said. ""This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States.""

The Mandelson question

For all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson. The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future. Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when?

Carl Court/Getty Images The PM will likely be asked why he appointed Lord Mandelson and why he took so long to sack him

Some diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position. But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him. According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job. It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial.

Diplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit. But there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit.

Profound differences in the UK and US

The Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: ""On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China. ""The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two."" Perhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East. Next week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called ""two state solution"". But the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment ""to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism"".

Getty Images Protests took place in the UK during Trump's last state visit, and there was a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby

There are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships. Yet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him. The government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy.

The diplomatic game of cards

Amid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes? ""The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King's letter in the Oval Office,"" said one royal source. ""They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can't in Whitehall.

Peter Summers/Getty Images There have only ever been three state visits by US presidents: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and President Trump in 2019

""The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government."" Official state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal.

A gleaming white Vivaro van drove slowly off the production line at Vauxhall's factory in Luton, beeping its horn, while workers cheered and crowded around taking photographs. Behind it, the production line came to a halt – forever. The Luton plant began building cars in 1905. It kept operating for the next 120 years, taking time out to build tanks and aircraft engines during World War Two. But on 28 March, that came to an end. The factory shut down, a victim of cutbacks at Vauxhall's parent company, Stellantis. Justin Nicholls, a production shift manager, was one of the 1,100 workers there - he had worked at the plant for 38 years. ""It was devastating, because it came out of the blue"", he says. ""It was a complete surprise."" It followed the closure of Honda's car factory in Swindon in 2021, and Ford's engine plant in Bridgend the year before. Together, they have come to symbolise an apparent long-term decline in the UK motor industry.

In all, just 417,000 new cars and vans were built in the UK in the first six months of 2025, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) - the lowest for that period since 1953. Output for the year is expected to be around 755,000 vehicles — lower even than during the Covid-19 pandemic. The SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, described the situation as ""depressing"". The sector contributes some £22bn a year to the economy, according to the SMMT, and as recently as 2023 automotive manufacturing employed some 198,000 people in the UK. Andy Palmer, who was previously chief executive of Aston Martin, believes the ecosystem - and the sum it contributes to the economy - can only survive if the industry maintains its current scale.

""There is a critical mass of employment,"" he explains. ""Once you go below that, you see it all fall apart. ""You don't have the university courses, you don't have people coming across from the aero industry, you don't have the pipeline of skilled engineers that allow the luxury firms to exist, and so on."" And the knock-on effect of this could affect regions already facing challenges. ""If we think about parts of the UK that have automotive plants, they're often disadvantaged regions,"" says David Bailey, professor of business economics at Birmingham Business School. ""Losing these good quality jobs would have a big impact in terms of wages for workers and also a knock-on effect in terms of the multiplier on the local economy."" He is concerned about what has already been lost. ""I'd argue that actually we've let too much of this go already. I think once it's gone, it's really gone."" The question is, can the industry recover - or is it too late?

A concealed deeper problem

The UK car industry is sprawling. Alongside large factories run by the likes of JLR, Nissan, BMW MINI and Toyota, there is a network of suppliers and high-tech specialist engineering firms, along with a number of smaller, luxury car firms, such as Aston Martin, Bentley, Rolls-Royce and McLaren, plus bus and truck manufacturers. In 2016, the UK produced 1.82m new vehicles – more than at any point since 1999. Yet even at that point, storm clouds were already gathering. And the industry has suffered further over the past decade. Factory closures have had an impact, but other factors have been at play as well, including uncertainty over US trade policy, which has hit exports to a major market. Then there was the role of Brexit.

""Obviously, Brexit had a big impact"", says Santiago Arieu, senior autos research analyst at Fitch Solutions. ""It created uncertainty and complicated future visibility."" As a result, experts say new investment suffered – just as the industry was gearing up for the massive changes being brought by the transition to electric vehicles. The agreement with the EU to guarantee continued tariff-free trade soothed the industry's concerns when it came. But by then, there was another challenge to contend with. The pandemic caused havoc within the industry globally. In 2020, output dropped by nearly a third, hitting levels not seen since the mid-1980s. It also threw finely tuned global supply chains out of kilter and created shortages of vital parts. Although demand for new cars was spiking, manufacturers simply couldn't build them quickly enough.

Reuters/ Chris Radburn 'Losing these good quality jobs would have a big impact in terms of wages for workers and also a knock-on effect in terms of the multiplier on the local economy,' says one expert

All of this caused short-term disruption - but the impact concealed a deeper, structural problem for the UK industry. Quite simply, it has become an expensive place to build cars. Part of this is to do with labour costs. Although lower than in some other Western European countries, particularly Germany, they are around twice the level seen in Central European nations such as Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. Then, there are energy costs. British manufacturers currently pay some of the highest electricity prices in the world. ""Car makers operating in the UK also have factories in Europe and elsewhere, so it's not hard for them to find a replacement for their UK production,"" explains Felipe Munoz of JATO Dynamics. The former chief executive of Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, has previously criticised the cost of manufacturing cars in the UK and northern Europe – while holding up the company's Kenitra factory in Morocco as a model of efficiency.

The investments starting to bear fruit

When the Luton plant shut last year, it was estimated by Luton Borough Council that the move could cost the regional economy £300m per year. A small part of the workforce relocated to Stellantis' other UK plant, at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, where the company is in the process of investing £50m in expanding production. Of those who have not relocated, some retired. ""[Others] are taking quite a reduction in pay"", says Gary Reay, who was a representative of the Unite union at the plant. The factory site has been bought by a property firm, Goodman - it plans to create more than 1,700 jobs at a new industrial park. Mr Reay is unimpressed. ""The problem for the workforce… is this is years down the road… It's too far away for most of our workers.""

Toby Melville/PA Wire Just 417,000 new cars and vans were built in the UK in the first six months of 2025

Yet there is hope in some quarters: it is possible this year's output may turn out to be a low point, as recent investments start to bear fruit. In 2024, for example, Nissan stopped building its ageing electric Leaf model at its Sunderland plant — having previously been building about 30,000 a year. But it is due to begin making a new version this year and will start building an electric version of the Juke in 2026. Nissan is also one of the manufacturers set to benefit from investments in gigafactories. Nissan's battery partner AESC is building one in Sunderland, which will be able to make power packs for 100,000 electric vehicles a year. JLR's parent company, Tata, meanwhile, is investing in its own plant in Somerset, through its subsidiary Agratas.

The government says it wants to increase the number of cars and commercial vehicles built annually to 1.3m by 2035. The SMMT believes 803,000 vehicles will leave the production lines next year but bringing that up to 1.3m looks like a very tall order, according to Mike Hawes. Greg McDonald, the CEO of Goodfish Group, is also circumspect. ""I don't think many people think there's going to be a resurgence,"" he says. His business makes injection moulded components for carmakers and has four sites across the UK. It also has a base in Slovakia. ""Suppliers like us are used to being constantly bid at for price and cost reductions, and there's a limit to how much you can do.""

Diversifying or Chinese investment?

One way of mitigating this is for businesses to diversify - something more viable for smaller businesses in the sector. Burnett's Manufacturing, based in Northampton, is one of many automotive suppliers clustered around the Midlands Corridor. A manufacturer of specialist rubber and plastic parts, it relies on the motor industry for about 40% of its business. But it also provides components for shipbuilders and oil and gas firms. According to technical sales manager, Rich Dixon, smaller companies are more flexible and able to adapt to changing circumstances. ""I think we're lucky in some ways, because 60% of our business is diversified across many different industries,"" he says. ""The last thing you want to be is 100% automotive. ""The difficulty is that higher up the food chain, there are some big companies that are very reliant on automotive.""

Yang Dong/VCG via Getty Images Chinese giants such as Dongfeng want to expand their international operations

Some argue there is another way forward. Chinese giants such as Chery Group and Dongfeng want to expand their international operations – and see the transition to electric vehicles as an opportunity to do this in the European market. ""If you embrace the move to electric vehicles and become a leading light in attracting Chinese investment, then you can do what China did to us in the past, which is essentially use collaboration to rebuild your industry,"" argues Andy Palmer, who now owns and invests in clean energy companies. This would, he adds, require significant government action, including negotiations with Beijing. The question is, is it already too late? One senior executive, who has spent decades in the European industry, doesn't believe the UK will become a major player in the EV market. ""I don't think governments have spent the necessary time and energy preparing for the shift to EVs.

Chris J. Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images The UK is home to a number of luxury car firms, such as Bentley

""I don't see much opportunity for new players to come in,"" says the executive, who asked not to be named. ""It's all about encouraging those who are already here to stay, and if possible to expand."" Another option, Felipe Munoz believes, is that the UK could double down on its position as a key player in the market for high-end cars. This could mean becoming a hub for the production of luxury Chinese designs, while allowing cheaper mass-market models to be built elsewhere. ""I think people globally are willing to pay a premium for a British-made luxury car,"" adds Prof Bailey.

The Great British 'brain drain'

There is plenty at stake here, and it goes beyond the impact on local communities when factories are lost or suppliers stop trading. ""I also worry about it in terms of impacts on productivity, exports, and research and development,"" says Prof Bailey. ""Part of the reason why we've got poor productivity performance in the UK is that we have allowed too much manufacturing to go."" This is where we differ from our European counterparts, argues Steve Fowler, EV editor for The Independent. ""We tend not to support our homegrown industries in the same way that other countries do"". What is harder to assess is the loss of national prestige. When MG Rover collapsed in 2005, there was an outcry, not just because thousands lost their jobs, but also because it was perceived as a symbol of the wider decline of British industry. This became even more marked when MG – a classic British brand – became a boutique badge for cars made in China.

Bloomberg via Getty Images ‘The UK is a great place to make cars, we have incredible expertise’

Many of the upmarket brands that still build cars in this country deliberately trade on their British identity. Think of Rolls Royce, Bentley, McLaren and Lotus. Even BMW-Mini, a mass market manufacturer, is more than willing to wave the Union Jack – or rather, have it painted on door mirrors and roofs. If those cars were no longer built in Britain, it might well be perceived as a national humiliation. And for some, the decline of the auto industry would almost certainly be perceived as a symptom of a much wider loss. ""I do think people are [becoming] much more aware of where things are made,"" argues Mr Fowler. ""This isn't necessarily a nationalistic thing, but more a sustainability thing. Do you want your car to have travelled halfway around the world to reach you?"" Ultimately, he says, there is already ""a bit of a brain drain of talent, because the opportunities, bluntly, aren't here in the UK. ""[But] the UK is a great place to make cars, we have incredible expertise, we have some of the best engineers and people who can build them better than anybody else.""

BBC

In April Donald Trump stunned the world by announcing sweeping new import tariffs – only to put most on hold amid the resulting global financial panic. Four months later, the US president is touting what he claims are a series of victories, having unveiled a handful of deals with trading partners and unilaterally imposed tariffs on others, all without the kind of massive disruptions to the financial markets that his spring attempt triggered. At least, so far. Having worked to reorder America's place in the global economy, Trump is now promising that the US will reap the benefits of new revenue, rekindle domestic manufacturing, and generate hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign investment and purchases. Whether that turns out to be the case – and whether these actions will have negative consequences – is still very much in doubt. What is clear so far, however, is that a tide that was (gently) turning on free trade, even ahead of Trump's second term, has become a wave crashing across the globe. And while it is reshaping the economic landscape, it hasn't left the kind of wreckage in its wake that some might have predicted - though of course there is often a lag before impact is fully seen. What's more, for many countries, this has all served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances. And so, while the short term result might be - as Trump sees it - a victory, the impact on his overarching goals is far less certain. As are the long-term repercussions, which could well pan out rather differently for Trump - or the America he leaves behind after his current term.

The '90 deals in 90 days' deadline

For all the wrong reasons, 1 August had been ringed on international policymakers' calendars. Agree new trading terms with the US by then, they'd been warned – or face potentially ruinous tariffs. While White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted ""90 deals in 90 days"" and Trump offered an optimistic outlook on reaching agreements, the deadline always appeared to be a tall order. And it was. By the time the end of July rolled around, Trump had only announced about a dozen trade deals – some no more than a page or two long, without the kind of detailed provisions standard in past negotiations.

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/Pool The baseline 10% applied to most British goods raised eyebrows at first – but was a relief compared to the 15% rate on other trading partners

The UK was first off the blocks, perhaps inevitably. Trump's biggest bugbear is, after all, America's trade deficit, and trade is in broad balance when it comes to the UK. While the baseline 10% applied to most British goods may initially have raised eyebrows, it provided a hint of what was to follow – and in the end came as a relief compared to the 15% rate applied to other trading partners such as the EU and Japan, with whom the US has larger deficits; $240bn and $70bn respectively last year alone. And even those agreements came with strings attached. Those countries that weren't able to commit to, say, buying more American goods, often faced higher tariffs. South Korea, Cambodia, Pakistan - as the list grew, and tariff letters were fired off elsewhere, the bulk of American imports are now covered by either an agreement or a presidential decree concluded with a curt ""thank you for your attention to this matter"".

Capacity to 'damage' the global economy

Much has been revealed as a result of this. First, the good news. The wrangling of the last few months means the most painful of tariffs, and recession warnings, have been dodged. The worst fears – in terms of tariff levels and potential economic fallout (for the US and elsewhere) - have not been realised.

JOHN G MABANGLO/EPA/Shutterstock The greatest fears - the warnings of potential disaster - have receded

Second, the agreement of tariff terms, however unpalatable, reduced much of the uncertainty (itself wielded by Trump as a powerful economic weapon) for better - and for worse. For better, in the sense that businesses are able to make plans, investment and hiring decisions that had been paused may now be resumed. Most exporters know what size tariffs their goods face – and can figure out how to accommodate or pass on the cost to consumers. That growing sense of certainty underpins a more relaxed mood in financial markets, with shares in the US notably gaining.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein Trump hailed the size of the agreement of the US with the EU – but these are not the tariff-busting deals equated with tearing down trade barriers in the past

But it's for the worse, in the sense that the typical tariff for selling into the US is higher than before – and more extreme than analysts predicted just six months ago. Trump may have hailed the size of the agreement of the US with the EU – but these are not the tariff-busting deals we equated with tearing down trade barriers in previous decades. The greatest fears, the warnings of potential disaster, have receded. But Ben May, Director of global macro forecasting at Oxford Economics, says that US tariffs had the capacity to ""damage"" the global economy in several ways. ""They are obviously raising prices in the US and squeezing household incomes,"" he says, adding that the policies would also reduce demand around the world if the world's largest economy ends up importing fewer goods.

Winners and losers: Germany, India and China

It's not just about the size of tariff, but the scale of trading relationship with the US. So while India potentially faces tariffs of over 25% on its exports to the US, economists at Capital Economics reckon that, with US demand accounting for just 2% of that nation's gross domestic product, the immediate impact on growth could be minor. The news is not so good for Germany, though, where the 15% tariffs could knock more than half a percentage point off growth this year, compared to what was expected earlier in the year. That's due to the size of its automotive sector - unhelpful for an economy that may be teetering on the brink of recession.

Meanwhile, India became the top source of smartphones sold in the US in the last few months, after fears of what may lie in store for China prompted Apple to shift production. On the other hand, India will be mindful that the likes of Vietnam and the Philippines – which face lower tariffs when selling to the US – may become relatively more attractive suppliers in other industries. Across the board, however, there's relief that the blow, at least, is likely to be less extensive than might have been. But what has been decided already points to longer-term ramifications for global trading patterns and alliances elsewhere. And the element of jeopardy introduced into a long-established major relationship with the US, lent added momentum to the UK's pursuit of closer ties with the EU – and getting a trade deal with India over the line. For many countries, this has served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances.

A very real political threat for Trump?

As details are nailed down, the implications for the US economy become clearer too. Growth in the late spring there actually benefitted from a flurry of export sales, as businesses rushed to beat any higher tariffs imposed on American goods. Economists expect that growth to lose momentum over the rest of the year.

Tariffs that have increased from an average of 2% at the beginning of the year to around 17% now have had a notable impact on US government revenue – one of the stated goals of Trump's trade policy. Import duties have brought in more than $100bn so far this year - about 5% of US federal revenue, compared to around 2% in past years. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expected tariff revenue this year to total about $300bn. By comparison, federal income taxes bring in around $2.5tn a year. American shoppers remain in the front line, and have yet to see higher prices passed on in full. But as consumer goods giants such as Unilever and Adidas start to put numbers on the cost increases involved, some sticker shock, price rises, loom – potentially enough to delay Trump's desired rate cut – and possibly a dent to consumer spending.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein If the current tariffs trigger a foundational realignment, the results may not ultimately break in favour of the US

Forecasts are always uncertain, of course, but this represents a very real political threat for a president who promised to lower consumer prices, not take actions that would raise them. Trump and other White House officials have floated the idea of providing rebate checks to lower-income Americans – the kinds of blue-collar voters who have fuelled the president's political success – that would offset some of the pocketbook pain. Such an effort could be unwieldy, and it would require congressional approval. It's also a tacit acknowledgment that simply boasting of new federal revenue to offset current spending and tax cuts, and holding out the prospect of future domestic job and wealth creation is politically perilous for a Republican party that will have to face voters in next year's midterm state and congressional midterm elections.

The deals yet to be hammered out

Complicating all this is the fact that there are many places where a deal is yet to be hammered out – most notably Canada and Taiwan. The US administration has yet to pronounce its decisions for the pharmaceuticals and steel industry. The colossal issue of China, subject to a different deadline, remains unresolved. Trump agreed to a negotiating extension with Mexico, another major US trading partner, on Thursday morning. Many of the deals that have been struck have been verbal, as yet unsigned. Moreover it is uncertain if and how the strings attached to Trump's agreements – more money to be spent purchasing American energy or invested in America – will actually be delivered on. In some cases, foreign leaders have denied the existence of provisions touted by the president.

YURI GRIPAS/POOL/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Trump's overarching aim - to return production and jobs to America – may meet with very limited success

When it comes to assessing tariff agreements between the White House and various countries, says Mr May, the ""devil is in the detail"" – and the details are light. It's clear, however, that the world has shifted back from the brink of a ruinous trade war. Now, as nations grapple with a new set of trade barriers, Trump aims to call the shots. But history tells us that his overarching aim - to return production and jobs to America – may meet with very limited success. And America's long-time trading partners, like Canada and the EU, could start looking to form economic and political connections that bypass what they no longer view as a reliable economic ally. Trump may be benefitting from the leverage afforded by America's unique position at the centre of a global trading order that it spent more than half a century establishing. If the current tariffs trigger a foundational realignment, however, the results may not ultimately break in favour of the US. Those questions will be answered over years, not weeks or months. In the meantime, Trump's own voters may still have to pick up the tab – through higher prices, less choice and slower growth. Additional reporting: Michael Race.

Getty Drug tests on rabbits could end by the end of the year

The government has detailed for the first time how it aims to fulfil its manifesto pledge to work toward phasing out animal testing. The new plans include replacing animal testing for some major safety tests by the end of this year and cutting the use of dogs and non-human primates in tests for human medicines by at least 35% by 2030. The Labour Party said in its manifesto that it would ""partner with scientists, industry, and civil society as we work towards the phasing out of animal testing"". Science Minister Lord Vallance told BBC News that he could imagine a day where the use of animals in science was almost completely phased out but acknowledged that it would take time.

Animal experiments in the UK peaked at 4.14 million in 2015 driven mainly by a big increase then in genetic modification experiments – mostly on mice and fish By 2020, the number had fallen sharply to 2.88 million as alternative methods were developed. But since then that decline has plateaued. Lord Vallance told BBC News that he wants to re-ignite the fast downward trend by replacing animal testing with experiments on animal tissues grown from stem cells, AI, and computer simulations. Asked by BBC News if he could envisage a world where animal tests were ""near zero"", he said: ""I think that is possible, it's not possible anytime soon, the idea that we can eliminate animal use in the foreseeable future, I don't think is there. ""Can we get very close to it? I think we can. Can we push faster than we have been? I think we can. Should we? We absolutely should."" ""This is a moment to really grasp that and drive these alternative approaches,"" he said. According to the government's newly detailed plans, by the end of 2025, scientists will stop using animals for some major safety tests and switch to newer lab methods that use human cells instead.

As a former government chief scientific advisor and former head of research for a major pharmaceutical company, he will know that many scientists believe reaching ""near zero"" tests on animals will be extremely difficult, even in the longer term. That includes those who are the greatest advocates of non-animal methods. ""I very strongly believe that that is not possible for reasons of safety,"" said Prof Frances Balkwill, of Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London. Prof Balkwill is working on finding ways stop ovarian cancer recurring, using mice as well as non-animal approaches, of which she is a huge fan. ""These non-animal methods will never replace the complexity that we can see when we have a tumour growing in a whole organism, such as a mouse,"" she said.

Kevin Church/BBC News This organ on a chip can hold small amounts of human cells from different organs and be used in place of animals for some types of experiments

One of the world's leading centres for developing alternatives to animal testing is the Centre for Predictive in vitro Models (CPM) at Queen Mary University of London. Researchers here are developing the extraordinarily sounding ""organ-on-a-chip"" technology, conjuring up alarming images of throbbing brains and beating hearts sitting on top of electronic circuits. The reality, though, is far less sci-fi. Some small pieces of glassware containing tiny samples of human cells from different organs from the body, such as the liver or brain, are connected to electrodes which send information to a computer. What is amazing, said the CPM's co-director, Prof Hazel Screen, is that cells from various parts of the body can be connected together to mimic how different organs work together. ""In theory, you can build any organ on a chip. Then I can use it to test a new drug,"" she said. ""And because we're taking human cells, we should be able to do better quality science.""",2025-11-14T17:18:45.238941

In February 1953, two men walked into a pub in Cambridge and announced they had found ""the secret of life"". It was not an idle boast. One was James Watson, an American biologist from the Cavendish laboratory; the other was his British research partner, Francis Crick. Their discovery - of the structure and function of deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA - ranks alongside those of Mendel and Darwin in its significance to modern science. The full Promethean power of their achievement would slowly emerge over decades of research by fellow geneticists. It also opened a Pandora's Box of controversial scientific and ethical issues - including human cloning, designer babies and ""Frankenstein foods"". Demonstrating that DNA has a three-dimensional, double-helix shape allowed Watson and Crick to unlock the secrets of how cells worked; the means by which characteristics were passed down through generations. ""When we saw the answer we had to pinch ourselves,"" said Watson. ""We realised it probably was true because it was so pretty."" The discovery won them a Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1962 and a permanent place in the historic ranks of great scientific thinkers. It also guaranteed that, if they said something controversial, it made headline news. And Watson - who has died aged 97 - had plenty to say, most notoriously speculating about a link between race and intelligence.

Gonville & Caius College At Cambridge, James Watson (right) met Francis Crick, a brilliant scientist with the loudest laugh he had ever encountered

When he first suggested that black people are less intelligent, London's Science Museum cancelled a planned lecture - insisting Watson's views went ""beyond the point of acceptable debate"". He suggested ""when you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know you're not going to hire them"". And he wondered aloud if beauty not only could - but should - be genetically encouraged. Watson was heavily criticised for saying that women should have the right to abort her unborn child if tests proved it would be homosexual. He argued he was simply in favour of choice, that it would be equally permissible to favour homosexual offspring and that it was simply natural to want grandchildren. He alienated many in his own profession, calling many fellow academics ""dinosaurs"", ""deadbeats"", ""fossils"" and ""has-beens"" in his autobiography, Avoid Boring People. In 2014, he became the first living recipient of the Nobel Prize to auction off his medal - in part to help fund future scientific discovery. A Russian tycoon bought it for $4.8m (£3m) and promptly gave it back to him.

James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on 6 April 1928 to a family who believed in ""books, birds and the Democratic Party"". He was the only son of Jean and James, who were descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers. His political interest came from his mother who worked for the Democrats. The basement of their bungalow would be pressed into service as a polling station at election time. His father's passions were science and bird-watching. Young Watson would accompany his father on birding trips. He learned that science was a discipline demanding careful observation from nature.

This left no place for faith. Brought up a Catholic by his mother, Watson described himself as an ""escapee from that religion"". ""The luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father did not believe in God,"" he said. The Great Depression of the 1930s saw his father's salary suddenly cut in half and a dash to the bank to get their remaining savings out in time. Watson slept in a tiny attic room shared with his younger sister, Betty. He was a skinny teenager told to go to buy milkshakes to ""fatten him up"". He was socially awkward and expelled from school for poor grades - his work badly affected by a bout of scarlet fever. ""None of my classmates thought I would amount to much,"" he recalled. He did not think of himself as a precocious intellect but he took up a scholarship at the University of Chicago at the tender age of 15. He put it down to ""my mother knowing the dean of admissions"".

Intellectual flowering

University freed him from complicated social hierarchies of school life where popularity and physical stature were critical. It provided the environment where a brilliant but awkward teenager could thrive. Watson thought of majoring in ornithology, the study of birds, but changed to genetics - influenced by Erwin Schrodinger's book What is Life? He described the University of Chicago as an ""idyllic academic institution"" where he was ""instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth"". The prevailing scientific wisdom was that genes were proteins able to replicate themselves. The presence of DNA was dismissed as something ""stupid"" simply there to support the protein. Watson became fascinated by the new technique of diffraction whereby X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures. He became convinced that DNA had a structure of its own and was determined to find it. He thought the place to do that was England.

At Cambridge, he met Francis Crick, a physicist by training with ""extraordinary conversational ability"" and ""the loudest laugh I have ever known"". They began constructing large-scale models of possible structures for DNA and trying to fit them to the available evidence. In one of the biggest scientific controversies of all time, not all of this evidence was their own. Watson and Crick were in a race with another team at King's College London. Their rivals were Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin. They got on well with him and appallingly badly with her.

Rosalind Franklin

Wilkins corresponded with the Cambridge pair, sometimes exchanging his thoughts and insights. But Franklin was different. She was the most experienced chemist and an expert in diffraction. She, alongside her student Raymond Gosling, would take photographs of the patterns made by X-rays as they bounced off DNA molecules. Watson and Crick found Franklin ""hostile"" and thought she jealously guarded her research and worked in isolation. They were dismissive and sniped about her appearance, but Watson wasn't above taking a look at her work when Wilkins offered.

The key evidence was Photo 51. It shows a fuzzy pattern of X-rays that fascinated the Cambridge pair. They threw themselves into a frenzy of model building, testing each theory against the new information. From this, they deduced that DNA must have a three-dimensional, double-helix structure - like a twisted ladder with rungs formed of alternating salt and phosphate groups. Their key conclusions were that, if separated, each strand provided a template for creating the other and that the order of the ""rungs"" was a code. If you can understand that code, they reasoned, you can unpick the wonders of life.

Nobel Prize

Wilkins wrote to his rivals to congratulate them on winning what had, at times, been a bitter race. When he was awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Medicine - alongside Watson and Crick - Franklin did not accompany them. Her life was cut short by ovarian cancer at just 37. According to the rules of the Nobel committee, only the living could be honoured. Her fans felt Franklin had been cheated twice.

Later Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard. He became professor of biology and had two sons - one of whom suffered from schizophrenia. Then he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an ailing institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes. In 1968, his account of the race to discover the structure of DNA, The Double Helix, was published. It is a painful examination of the story. It rakes over the personalities, controversies and bitterness from his point of view. He considered calling the book Honest Jim. But for all Professor Watson's academic achievements, his later career was overshadowed by his controversial public statements.

Watson (right) said Crick had ""extraordinary conversational ability""

In 1990, the journal Science wrote that ""to many in the scientific community, Watson has long been something of a wild man, and his colleagues tend to hold their collective breath whenever he veers from the script"". At a conference in 2000, Watson proved it right. He floated the idea that black people might have larger libidos than whites. His lecture argued that melanin, which gives skin its colour, boosted the sex drive. ""That's why you have Latin lovers,"" he told the delegates. ""You never have an English lover, only an English patient."" He suggested that humanity might screen out the stupid people by genetic testing. Then he gave an interview that put the biggest dent in his reputation. While promoting his autobiography, Watson spoke to the Sunday Times. The piece quoted him as ""gloomy about the prospect of Africa"" because ""our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really"". Watson went on to admit this ""hot potato"" was difficult to address and his hope was that everyone was equal. However, he said, ""People who have to deal with black employees find this not true"". He later apologised but his research institute stripped him of executive power and kicked him upstairs as chancellor emeritus.

PA Media Bird flu outbreaks across UK farms has led to a mandatory housing order being brought in

The bird flu virus infecting farm flocks across the UK could be the most infectious yet, the government's former top expert in avian virology has warned. The Pirbright Institute's Professor Ian Brown, formerly director of science at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), said farmers should be ""prepared for the worst"". With a national mandatory housing order brought into force in England on Thursday, one free-range egg producer in Wiltshire told the BBC she felt ""terrible"" bringing her 32,000 hens inside but an outbreak would be ""disastrous"". The government said the mandatory housing order would ""bring the rates of infection down from the high we are currently experiencing"".

The Pirbright Institute Professor Ian Brown warned that the virus could mutate so needs to be closely monitored

So far this season - which began in October - there have been 26 cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 on farms across the UK, with 22 in England alone. Whole flocks have to be culled when an outbreak occurs. Professor Brown told the BBC that the current virus was ""as super-infectious as any high pathogenicity avian influenza we've ever seen"". He added that farmers should now ""prepare for the worst, I'm afraid"". ""We had a very, very serious epidemic between 2021 and 2023 - in excess of 350 outbreaks in the UK. That's off the scale,"" he explained. ""Now, it's really, really difficult to state what the final size of this outbreak would be, but the early signals are not great."" He added that the threat level meant the poultry industry needed to ""batten the hatches down, review their biosecurity and redouble their efforts"".

Sarah Godwin Despite bringing 32,000 free-range hens inside, farmer Sarah Godwin remains ""very nervous""

Sarah Godwin runs a mixed egg, arable and dairy family farm near North Wraxall, in Wiltshire, with her husband and brother-in-law. Her 32,000-laying hens would normally be outdoors for most of the day. They now have to be kept in their barns around the clock. ""It is terrible. We would love to see them out but it is just a necessary evil because the risk of them catching avian influenza is so high and the consequences are so disastrous for a producer, and for the hens as well,"" she explained. But despite bringing the hens inside and putting in place strict biosecurity measures, Mrs Godwin remains ""very nervous"". She said: ""It only takes a tiny, tiny bit of contaminated muck from a wild bird or something that's been brought into the shed on somebody's boots. ""It's literally grammes that can infect the whole flock. And at that point, the whole flock has to be culled.""

Reuters Jared Isaacman is reportedly friends with Elon Musk and has spent millions of dollars on SpaceX missions

Donald Trump has renominated billionaire investor Jared Isaacman to run Nasa, five months after withdrawing his first nomination. The 42-year-old entrepreneur, who has ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, had looked set to lead the space agency when Trump abruptly pulled his nomination in late May, following what the president said was a ""thorough review of prior associations."" While the White House did not specify what those associations were, it was during Trump's high-profile feud with Musk. Isaacman, who is worth an estimated $1.9bn (£1.46bn), is an amateur jet pilot and also became the first non-professional astronaut to walk in space last year, on a mission with SpaceX that he bankrolled.

Why Trump has suddenly changed his mind is unclear, and the president made no mention of the past when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that he was ""pleased to nominate"" Isaacman for the role. ""Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,"" the president wrote. The Nasa administrator role will be Isaacman's first job in politics, representing a departure from the last two men appointed to the job. It requires confirmation by the Senate, where the Republican Party holds a 53-47 majority. Even though the US government has been shut down since early October, the Senate is still able to confirm presidential nominees. Thanking the president, Isaacman wrote on X that ""it will be an honor"" to serve in the role. ""The support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming,"" he wrote in a long post, that also acknowledged Nasa scientists and innovators. ""I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.""

4 November 2025 Share Save Pallab Ghosh Science Correspondent Share Save

David Braun They look like simple stones, but they were state of the art tools millions of years ago, made with great skill and precison

The very first humans millions of years ago may have been inventors, according to a discovery in northwest Kenya. Researchers have found that the primitive humans who lived 2.75 million years ago at an archaeological site called Namorotukunan used stone tools continuously for 300,000 years. Evidence previously suggested that early human tool use was sporadic: randomly developed and quickly forgotten. The Namorotukunan find is the first to show that the technology was passed down through thousands of generations.

According to Prof David Braun, of George Washington University, in Washington DC, who led the research, this find, published in the journal Nature Communications, provides incredibly strong evidence for a radical shake-up in our understanding of human evolution. ""We thought that tool use could have been a flash in the pan and then disappeared. When we see 300,000 years of the same thing, that's just not possible,"" he said. ""This is a long continuity of behaviour. That tool use in (humans and human ancestors) is probably much earlier and more continuous than we thought it was.""

David Braun The stone tools were so sharp that the researchers could cut their fingers on some of them

Archaeologists spent ten years at Namorotukunan uncovering 1,300 sharp flakes, hammerstones, and stone cores, each made by carefully striking rocks gathered from riverbeds. These are made using a technology known as Oldowan and is the first widespread stone tool-making method. The same kinds of tools appear in three distinct layers. The deeper the layer the further back the snapshot in time. Many of the stones were specially chosen for their quality, suggesting that the makers were skilled and knew exactly what they were looking for, according to the senior geoscientist on the research team, Dr Dan Palcu Rolier of the University of São Paulo in Brazil. ""What we see here in the site is an incredible level of sophistication,"" he told BBC News. ""These guys were extremely astute geologists. They knew how to find the best raw materials and these stone tools are exceptional. Basically, we can cut our fingers with some of them."" Geological evidence suggests that tool use probably helped these people survive dramatic changes in climate. The landscape shifted from lush wetlands to dry, fire-swept grasslands and semideserts,"" said Rahab N. Kinyanjui, senior scientist at the National Museums of Kenya.

These sharp environmental changes would normally force animal populations to adapt through evolution or move away. But the toolmakers in the region managed to thrive by using technology rather than biological adaptation, according to Dr Palcu Rolier. ""Technology enabled these early inhabitants of East Turkana to survive in a rapidly changing landscape - not by adapting themselves, but adapting their ways of finding food."" The evidence of stone tools at different layers shows that for a long and continuous period, these primitive people flew in the face of biological evolution, finding a way of controlling the world around them, rather than letting the world control them. And this happened at the very beginning of the emergence of humanity, according to Dr Palcu Rolier. ""Tool use meant that they did not have to evolve by modifying their bodies to adapt to these changes. Instead, they developed the technology they needed to get access to the food: tools for ripping open animal carcasses and digging up plants.""

David Braun The Namorotukunan site, located in Kenya's Turkana Basin, lies close to the ancient course of a long dried up major river which once attracted settlements of early humans and their ancestors

There is evidence for this at the site: of animal bones being broken, being cut with these stone tools, which means that through these changes, they were consistently able to use meat as a way of sustenance. ""The technology gives these early inhabitants an advantage, says Dr Palcu Rolier. ""They are able to access different types of foods as environments change, their source of sustenance is changing, but because they have this technology, they can bypass these challenges and access new food.""

The world's burning of fossil fuels is set to release more planet-warming carbon dioxide than ever before this year, new figures show. It is another sign that efforts to fight climate change by cutting emissions are moving far too slowly to meet international targets, as countries meet in Brazil for UN climate talks COP30. But emissions have grown much less quickly over the past decade as renewables have taken off, providing hope that the world's warming trend can still be curbed. And separate analysis by clean energy think tank Ember suggests that fossil fuel use in electricity generation has flatlined in 2025, largely thanks to the rapid growth of solar power.

It adds weight to the idea that global emissions may be nearing a peak – even though it's hard to say exactly when that might come. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for 2025 are of course an estimate, with the year not yet complete – but they show a mixed picture. Emissions from fossil fuels and cement are forecast to increase yet again to 38.1bn tonnes of CO2, according to the Global Carbon Budget team, which comprises more than 130 scientists from 21 countries. That would be up 1.1% on 2024.

Emissions from changing land-use – such as permanent deforestation – are forecast to be lower than last year, however. That's largely due to the end of the natural El Niño weather pattern - which can drive higher forest losses – but is the continuation of a longer-term trend. It means that, altogether, total emissions from all human activities are expected to reach 42.2bn tonnes CO2 in 2025 - down from the 42.4bn in 2024, albeit marginally. What is clearer, the team say, is that emissions have grown more slowly over the past decade - 0.3% per year - compared to the previous decade's 1.9% per year. And over the past 10 years, 35 countries significantly cut their fossil fuel emissions while also growing their economies, they say. That is nearly double the number in the decade before. ""We're not yet in a situation where the emissions go down [as] rapidly as they need to, to tackle climate change, but at the same time there are a lot of positive [developments]"" said Corinne Le Quéré, professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia. Emissions have been growing much less rapidly than before ""because of that extraordinary growth in renewable energy in China and elsewhere"", she added.

Nearing peak?

This effect of the renewables boom is highlighted by emissions in the power or electricity sector. Electricity generated from fossil fuels is forecast to flatline or even decline slightly this year, according to the think tank Ember, for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic. What's unusual about this year, Ember says, is that this has happened even though electricity demand increased sharply, rather than resulting from an economic recession. And this year's extra electricity demand has been more than met by wind and, particularly, solar. ""We've had decades and centuries where fossil fuels were the only way that we could really grow our economy, and over the last decade, that's changed for the first time,"" said Nicolas Fulghum, senior data analyst at Ember. ""Solar power is growing at a record pace, and faster than any electricity source in history,"" he added.

What happens in the power sector is particularly important in the fight against climate change. It is the single biggest emitting sector and is expected to play an increasing role in the energy system as more people buy electric cars, heat pumps and other technologies. ""Whatever happens in the power sector has an outsized influence on what happens for emissions worldwide,"" said Mr Fulghum. Ember is confident that emissions from using fossil fuels to generate electricity are now plateauing and could begin a permanent decline in a few years. That echoes yesterday's message from the International Energy Agency, the global energy watchdog. Carbon emissions from energy systems – more than just electricity - could peak within the next few years, based on countries' stated policies, it said. While there is still uncertainty about the exact timing of a peak, it would undoubtedly be a landmark moment in the fight against climate change. It would not halt warming, however, as countries would still be adding CO2 to the atmosphere - just at a slower rate. ""As long as we emit CO2, the warming will continue… to stop further warming, we have to bring [net] emissions to zero,"" said Prof Pierre Friedlingstein, chair in mathematical modelling of climate systems at the University of Exeter. And another analysis released today to coincide with COP30 offers a reality check. The Climate Action Tracker research group finds that warming could reach 2.6C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century based on current policies – a figure which has barely changed over the past few years. ""It's very clear that we have never had a better chance to do this. It's also clear that we've never been in a worse situation,"" said Dr Bill Hare, from the Climate Action Tracker team. ""So it's a diabolical dilemma. Things could go really badly. We could walk away from this COP without taking the right kind of action, and entrenching fossil gas and oil, and we'll push towards 2.5C [or] 3C warming for sure,"" he added. ""But on the other hand, the chance is there… to do exactly the opposite, and to build on the momentum of the technology changes going on globally.""",2025-11-14T17:18:54.333342

While COP30 takes place in Brazil, more than 80 pupils have been holding their own climate talks closer to home. The COP30 climate simulation negotiation brought pupils from 28 schools to Belfast Castle, where they represented countries, campaigners, lobbyists and journalists. This year's event was the first to bring together young people from both sides of the border, with four pupils from Dundalk Grammar School taking part. The pupils negotiated with each other to make international deals, and made speeches - one of which was even interrupted by a mock climate protest.

Blaithin, 17, and Niamh, 16, from St Catherine's College Armagh, were leading the event, which was organised by the British Council, as UN secretary generals. They were tasked with bringing all the participants to an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, supporting developing nations and adapting to the effects of climate change. Blaithin said despite COP30 taking place thousands of miles away, it was important to her generation. ""As a young person, knowing that we will face the impact of what's going to happen in the future, it's very relevant that we understand what is going on,"" she said. ""We have to live the life that's going to be controlled by what happens today."" Niamh thinks more could be done to educate young people about climate change. ""Social media is a big part of young people's lives, so I feel if we took more to social media for climate action, it would really influence young people today,"" she said.

More than 80 pupils worked together to form climate agreements

Jude, 17, from Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, said discussing climate change with young people from across Northern Ireland was a ""great experience"", but it's business people who should be talking about it more. ""It's them who are doing the most damage, and they need to realise that if they keep killing the planet, they won't have any more customers."" He worries that due to the gradual effects of climate change, ""the average person will only realise we need to change when the floods come to their doors and the droughts dry out their water supplies"". Lily-May, 18, also from Shimna Integrated College, said while it was ""enlightening"" meeting other young people passionate about the climate, most of her peers are ""not really engaged"". ""I think people just don't want to take the extra step or go their extra mile to be more environmentally friendly, even just by using a different bin.""

Colm McGivern, British Council Northern Ireland Director, said: ""It's wonderful to give young people the opportunity to think about one of the major international challenges facing the globe. ""It's really interesting to see how they've gripped the arguments and are getting into the detail, which is crucial if we're to be able to persuade people about the importance of working against climate change."" Environment Minister Andrew Muir, who made a speech at the event, said he was ""inspired and uplifted"" to hear young people engaging with climate action. ""To be honest, today stands in stark contrast to some of the politics in recent weeks in Northern Ireland.

Watch: Protesters clash with security at COP30 venue in Brazil

Protesters carrying signs reading ""our forests are not for sale"" broke through security lines of the COP30 climate talks on Tuesday night in Belém, Brazil. BBC journalists saw United Nations security staff running behind a line of Brazilian soldiers shouting at delegates to immediately leave the venue. The UN told BBC News that the incident caused minor injuries to two security staff, in addition to limited damage to the venue. Social media videos showed protesters that appeared to be from indigenous groups and others waving flags with the logo of a left-wing Brazilian youth movement called Juntos.

Protesters, some wearing what appeared to be traditional indigenous dress, stormed the COP30 entrance, chanting and kicking down doors, before tussling with security personnel, videos posted online showed. Demonstrators crossed the first security barriers of the venue and were then prevented from getting further in, the UN told the BBC. A security guard said he was hit in the head by a drum thrown by a protester, according to the Reuters news agency. It is a highly unusual security breach at a conference that has strict protocols. Brazilian and UN authorities are investigating the incident, according to the UN.

Delegates from almost 200 countries are attending COP30 talks, which officially runs from Monday 10 November to Friday 21 November. This year's gathering takes place ten years after the Paris climate agreement, in which countries pledged to try to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. It is the first time the conference is being held in Brazil, with the talks taking place in Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. The location has proved a controversial decision for a number of reasons, in part due to the Amazon's residents, many of whom are vocal critics of the environmental damage caused to their home by climate change and deforestation. Brazil has also continued to grant new licences for oil and gas which, alongside coal, are fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming. An indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community told Reuters, ""we can't eat money,"" and that they were upset about development in the rainforest. ""We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers,"" he said.

The meetings this year have been dubbed ""the Indigenous peoples COP"", with Brazilian organisers promising to put indigenous people at the centre of the talks. Brazil's Minister of Indigenous Peoples Sonia Guajajara hailed COP30 as ""historic"" event, and estimated that 3,000 Indigenous peoples from around the world would be in attendance. A UN report released earlier this year said that Indigenous people safeguard 80% of the planet's remaining biodiversity – yet receive less than one per cent of international climate funding. Indigenous peoples are disproportionately impacted by climate change due to their dependence on the natural environment and its resources. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told the opening of the summit that the world must ""defeat"" climate denialism and fight fake news.

A landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions has been abandoned after Saudi Arabia and the US succeeded in ending the talks. More than 100 countries had gathered in London to approve a deal first agreed in April, which would have seen shipping become the world's first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions. But US President Donald Trump had called the plan a ""green scam"" and representatives of his administration had threatened countries with tariffs if they voted in favour of it. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a ""huge win"" for Trump.

But reflecting the pressure countries faced, the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organisation Arsenio Dominguez issued a ""plea"" for this not to be repeated. In a dramatic conclusion on Friday, when countries should have been voting to approve the deal, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion to adjourn the talks for a year. The chairman said this would mean that the agreement was not approved, as key timelines for the treaty would have to be revised. The motion passed by just a handful of votes. Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said Saudi Arabia's motion was ""unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change"". ""We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,"" he said. The shipping industry has been broadly supportive of the deal because it offered consistent global standards. Speaking after the talks ended, Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the industry body the International Chamber of Shipping, said : ""We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting."" ""Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments,"" he added. The UK and most EU nations voted to continue the talks, but some countries including Greece went against the EU bloc and voted to abstain. The countries that voted in favour of adjourning the talks included Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US, who raised concerns that the deal would lead to price rises for consumers. Some key countries including China that had initially voted to support the deal in April agreed to delay proceedings. Island states Bahamas also changed their position and Antigua and Barbuda, who agreed in April, abstained. A delegate from the island states group told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position.",2025-11-14T17:19:03.874183

The lead author of the study, which was published in science journal Nature, said the findings have significant implications for global emissions reduction targets which are partly based on how ecosystems - such as rainforests - can absorb carbon.

But a study looking at data from Queensland forests found that extreme temperatures have caused more tree deaths than growths.

Rainforests are usually regarded as so-called ""carbon sinks"" as they absorb more emissions than they emit with new trees offsetting the carbon released by dead ones.

Australia's tropical rainforests have become the first in the world to release more carbon than they absorb, in a trend linked to climate change, a study has found.

""Current models may overestimate the capacity of tropical forests to help offset fossil fuel emissions,"" said Dr Hannah Carle of the Western Sydney University.

With fewer new trees, the report found that the trunks and branches of dead trees - known as woody biomass - became carbon emitters, rather than carbon absorbers, about 25 years ago.

""Forests help to curb the worst effects of climate change by absorbing some of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels, but our work shows this is under threat,"" said Dr Carle.

Dr Carle added that said an increase in trees dying in recent decades was due to climate change such as more extreme temperatures, atmospheric dryness and drought.

Based on 49 years of data from 20 forests in Queensland, the report also found a rise in the number of cyclones and the severity of them was killing more trees and making it harder for new ones to grow.

""We have in this study evidence that Australia's moist tropical forests are the first of their kind globally to to exhibit this [woody biomass] change,"" Dr Carle said.

""And that's really significant. It could be a sort of canary in the coal mine.""

Senior author Patrick Meir also described the results as ""very concerning"", telling news agency AFP that it was ""likely that all tropical forests [would] respond fairly similarly"" - but added that more data and research would be needed to make a fair assessment.

Australia, one of the world's biggest polluters per capita, recently announced its new carbon reduction targets, pledging to cut emissions by at least 62% compared to 2005 levels over the next decade.

The country continues to face global criticism for its continued reliance on fossil fuels, with the government allowing one of the country's largest gas projects -Woodside's North West Shelf - to keep operating for another 40 years.

Last month, a new report into the impact of climate change found Australia had already reached warming of above 1.5C and that no community would be immune from ""cascading, compounding and concurrent"" climate risks.",2025-11-14T17:19:05.527028

A brown hyena standing beside the ruins of an abandoned diamond mining settlement has earned wildlife photographer Wim van den Heever the title of Wildlife Photographer of the Year. He set up his camera trap after spotting fresh hyena tracks in the ghost town of Kolmanskop, Namibia. It took him ten years to get the shot, he said. The brown hyena, the rarest of all hyena species, is primarily nocturnal and tends to live a solitary life. For years, Mr van den Heever searched the deserted town, finding only traces of the elusive animal. ""I knew they were there, but actually photographing one was just never going to happen,"" he says he thought. He was awarded the prize at London's Natural History Museum.

Red Tractor The Red Tractor advert was last shown in 2023 but will now be banned for future use unless it is updated

A TV advert by Red Tractor, the UK's biggest certifier of farm products on supermarket shelves, has been banned for exaggerating the scheme's environmental benefits and misleading the public. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled the organisation had provided ""insufficient evidence"" that its farms complied with basic environmental laws to substantiate the claims in its ad. Environmental group River Action, which brought the complaint in 2023, said the ruling showed the scheme was ""greenwashing"" and urged supermarkets to stop using it. But Red Tractor called the watchdog's decision ""fundamentally flawed"" and argued that the scheme's focus was animal welfare not environmental standards.

In 2021, Red Tractor aired an advert in which it said: ""From field to store all our standards are met. When the Red Tractor's there, your food's farmed with care."" You can watch it below.

Watch: the ad banned by the Advertising Standards Authority

The environmental charity River Action took issue with the ad, which ran for a further two years, and complained to the watchdog that it suggested to consumers that Red Tractor farms will ""ensure a high degree of environmental protection"". The charity pointed to a report by the Environment Agency, released in 2020, which looked at how many breaches of environmental law there were on Red Tractor farms in the previous five years. The report concluded that these farms were ""not currently an indicator of good environmental performance"". After more than two years of investigation - one of the longest running - the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld the complaint. It said that Red Tractor had failed to provide ""sufficient evidence"" that its farms met ""basic"" environmental laws and had a good environmental outcome to substantiate the claims in the ad. It also ruled that as a result the advert was ""misleading"" and ""exaggerated"" the benefits of the scheme. River Action welcomed the decision by the ASA and called on supermarkets to act. ""What this shows is that for their environmental credentials Red Tractor has been misleading the public and their suppliers,"" said Amy Fairman, head of campaigns at River Action. ""So, we're looking for suppliers like supermarkets to really examine and take stock of what is on their shelves."" She added that challenging such adverts was important because of the risk to the environment from agricultural pollution. In 2022, the Environment Audit Committee concluded that agriculture was one of the most common factors preventing rivers from being in good health - affecting 40% of them. The risks to the environment include from slurry and pesticide runoff.

BBC News/Tony Jolliffe Amy Fairman represents environmental charity River Action which campaigns for clean and healthy rivers

But Red Tractor, which assures 45,000 farms in the UK, have pushed back strongly, calling the finding by the ASA ""fundamentally flawed"". Jim Mosley, CEO of Red Tractor, told the BBC: ""They believe that we have implied an environmental claim. Nowhere in the voiceover or the imagery is any environmental claim actually made."" He argued that the ASA only found a minority of people would think the advert meant Red Tractor farms had good environmental standards, and in fact the scheme is focused on other issues. ""Red Tractor's core purpose is food safety, animal welfare, and traceability. Whilst we have some environmental standards, they are a small part. And as a consequence, we leave that entirely to the Environment Agency to enforce environmental legislation,"" said Mr Moseley. When asked if that meant Red Tractor does not know if its farms are complying with environmental law, he said: ""Correct"".

But many supermarkets do refer to the environmental benefits of Red Tractor farms. Natalie Smith, Tesco's head of agriculture said last month, on the 25-year anniversary of Red Tractor: ""Certification schemes play a key role in providing reassurance for customers, and over the past 25 years, Red Tractor has established itself as a mark of quality, standing for… environmental protection."" On Morrisons' website it states: ""100% of the fresh pork, beef, lamb, poultry, milk and cheddar cheese we sell in our stores comes from farms certified by Red Tractor, or an approved equivalent scheme, giving customers assurance… environmental protection."" Both supermarkets were asked if they stood by the Red Tractor logo. Morrisons did not respond to a request for comment. A Tesco spokesperson said: ""We recognise there is still more to do, and it's essential that the Government and industry work together to drive change."" It also referred the BBC to their industry body the British Retail Consortium. The consortium said that ""retailers remain committed to working with Red Tractor"", but that the organisation themselves are owners of the scheme.",2025-11-14T17:19:09.260894

Hindustan Times via Getty Images India faces a severe air pollution crisis, ranking among the world's top 10 most polluted countries

India is losing sunlight. A new study by six Indian scientists finds that over the past three decades, sunshine hours - the time direct sunlight reaches the Earth's surface - have steadily declined across most of India, driven by clouds, aerosols and local weather. Data from 20 weather stations from 1988 to 2018 shows a persistent decline in sunshine hours nationwide, with only the northeast region seeing a mild seasonal reprieve, according to the paper published in Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed journal published by Nature Portfolio. Scientists from Banaras Hindu University, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and the India Meteorological Department report that the steepest annual declines occurred in the northern inland region - notably Amritsar and Kolkata - as well as along the Himalayan belt and the west coast, particularly Mumbai. All of nine India's geograpically diverse regions showed an overall annual decline in sunshine hours, though the rate of decrease varied across India. Monthly analysis revealed significant increases from October to May, followed by sharp drops from June to July in six of the nine regions. This seasonal pattern of sunshine intersects with a deeper, long-standing problem: India's severe air pollution crisis - it's now among the world's top 10 polluted countries - which scientists trace back to the 1990s. Rapid urbanisation, industrial growth and land-use changes drove up fossil fuel use, vehicle emissions and biomass burning, sending aerosols into the atmosphere and dimming the Sun's rays.

Getty Images Mumbai's sunshine hours are gradually declining, the scientists found

In winter, high air pollution from smog, temperature inversions and crop burning across the Indo-Gangetic plains produces light-scattering aerosols, which reduce sunshine hours. These aerosols - tiny solid or liquid particles from dust, vehicle exhaust, crop burning, and other sources - persist in the air long enough to affect sunlight, climate and health. During June-July, monsoon clouds blanket much of India, sharply reducing sunlight even though aerosol levels are lower than in winter. Scientists note that higher sunshine hours from October to May don't indicate cleaner air; rather, they reflect more cloud-free days. Hazy winter sunlight may scatter or diffuse, lowering intensity without entirely blocking sunshine, which instruments still record as sunshine hours. ""Our study found that shrinking sunshine hours are linked to clouds that linger longer without releasing rain, blocking more sunlight. These longer-lasting clouds form indirectly due to aerosols that alter weather and climate,"" says Manoj Kumar Srivastava, a professor of geophysics at the Banaras Hindu University, and one of the authors of the study. Aerosols have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the ground in India by about 13%, while clouds accounted for an additional 31-44% drop in surface solar radiation between 1993 and 2022, according to Sachchida Nand Tripathi, an atmospheric scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. These patterns raise concerns for agriculture, daily life and India's solar energy ambitions, while highlighting where solar panels could be most effective. Solar now makes up 47% of India's renewable energy capacity. The government says it's on track for 500GW of renewables by 2030, with more than 100GW of solar installed as of early 2025. But declining sunlight could cast a shadow on the country's solar ambitions. According to Prof Tripathi, air pollution compounds the problem. It reduces solar panel output by 12-41% depending on the type of photovoltaic system - the technology that converts sunlight into electricity - and costs an estimated $245-835m in lost power generation.

Getty Green turtles are large sea turtles found in tropical and subtropical oceans, known for their plant-based diet and reliance on beaches for nesting

The green turtle has been rescued from the brink of extinction in what scientists are calling a major conservation victory. Once hunted extensively for turtle soup, its eggs as a delicacy and decorative shells, the ancient mariner saw its numbers plummet and has been listed as endangered since the 1980s. Now, thanks to decades of global conservation efforts - from protecting eggs and releasing hatchlings on beaches, to reducing accidental capture in fishing nets - new data shows green turtle populations are rebounding. ""We must use this win as a catalyst to achieve numerous other wins,"" said Dr Nicolas Pilcher of the Marine Research Foundation, a non-profit based in Sabah, Malaysia.

Green turtles are one of the largest species of sea turtles, named for the greenish colour of their body fat, which comes from their plant-based diet. They are one of seven living species of sea turtles, two of which are critically endangered. Prof Brendan Godley, a conservation scientist at the University of Exeter, said green turtle populations in many parts of the world are showing signs of recovery due to conservation efforts over the last five decades, and while this work must continue for years to come, it gives cause for optimism. ""Sea turtles are iconic and charismatic species... they inspire people,"" he said. ""Hundreds of thousands of people have been working for decades to try and look after these creatures, and undoubtedly, it has had an impact."" The conservation efforts include patrolling beaches, protecting females and their eggs at nesting sites, releasing hatchlings into the sea, education and awareness to reduce turtles being killed for meat and eggs, and using measures to stop turtles being captured in fishing nets.

The latest Red List of endangered species was revealed at the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) world congress in Abu Dhabi. The unenviable list now includes 172,620 species, of which 48,646 are threatened with extinction. Species are moved between categories when new data shows changes in their population, habitat or threats. If a species becomes more at risk - for example, its numbers fall or its habitat is damaged - it may be moved to a higher-risk category such as Endangered; if it recovers thanks to conservation efforts, it may shift to a lower-risk category like Near Threatened or Least Concern. The green turtle has been downgraded from Endangered to Least Concern. However, despite recent gains, green turtles are still far below their historic numbers due to past overexploitation and ongoing threats like fishing, habitat loss and climate change. In places like Raine Island, Australia, fewer baby turtles are hatching, showing that conservation efforts are still urgently needed.

Andy Alcroft/BBC Emily Hough is now using her experiences to help shape nature prescribing schemes

For Emily Hough, nature was too often simply something ""out there"", a world apart from her, a view from a hospital window. Years spent in and out of specialist mental health units in Birmingham and London, being treated for the eating disorder she had had since the age of 12, meant she felt little connection with the countryside or interest in the everyday flora and fauna around her. That was until five years ago, when a hospital occupational therapist gave her an unusual prescription: Grow a sunflower. ""I'll be honest I'd never planted anything in my life,"" Ms Hough said.

""But I planted that sunflower and, just watching it grow, from me watering it and from me protecting it from the shade, helped me feel connected for the first time and really be able to appreciate what was around me - and how I can make a difference to nature and what nature can actually do for me. ""I was in a hospital at that point, so it was very limited. Fast forward five years, here we are today.""

Getty Images Green social prescribing encourages people to take part in nature-based activities to benefit their health and wellbeing

From those early roots, Ms Hough, now 35, embraced what is formally called by the NHS ""green social prescribing"", where GPs and health practitioners refer patients to organisations that offer nature-based activities, whether that be hiking, birdwatching, rockpooling or looking after a city-based allotment. It is supposed to complement other more mainstream treatments and therapies and has been a key part of the government's 10-year plan for the NHS in England. The scheme may not work for everyone but for Ms Hough, who has now relocated from Solihull to a life in the countryside, the benefits have been profound. She is now out of hospital and has become what the NHS calls an ""Expert by Experience"" (EbE) - someone who uses that experience to design and evaluate new health services. She helped shape the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB)'s flagship ""nature prescription"" scheme for the West Midlands, launched earlier this year. On Friday – World Mental Health Day - the scheme marks the training of its 100th health professional, with enough resources to support 1,000 patients accessing nature-based activities.

Andy Alcroft/BBC Dom Higgins, from the Wildlife Trusts, saids the evidence in favour of green social prescribing was clear

But the future of green social prescribing is uncertain. Despite a four-year national pilot that ended in March being judged a success by an independent evaluation of its first two years, there is concern that the onus for funding these schemes is being left to charities. Organisations, including The Wildlife Trusts, the RSPB and the Ocean Conservation Trust, are calling on the government to commit more funding to nature prescription schemes and to roll them out, beyond their initial seven trial areas. Dom Higgins, head of health and education for The Wildlife Trusts, said: ""It is unequivocal that nature improves mental health. ""I think the time for questioning the evidence is really over and people within the system and the NHS and decision makers get this. ""It's just we need the mechanism to make it available everywhere. It's time to seriously fund prevention and opportunities for people to create good health in the neighbourhoods where they live and work."" The national pilot scheme saw nearly 8,500 people prescribed nature activities in its first two years, with more than half those patients living in socio-economically deprived areas. Chris Dayson, professor of voluntary action, health and wellbeing at Sheffield Hallam University, who was part of the team that evaluated the scheme, said it brought ""a really statistically significant increase in wellbeing"" for patients. The evaluation also found the scheme brought an economic social return - not least of all by getting people back into work - of £2.42 for every £1 invested. When approached by the BBC, the government did not comment on the future of green social prescribing but said the evaluation of the second two years of the trial scheme would be published ""in due course"".

They are weird, bald, subterranean rodents that look like sausages with teeth, and they have just revealed a genetic secret to long life. A new study of the bizarre naked mole rat shows that the animals have evolved a DNA repair mechanism that could explain their longevity. These burrow-dwelling rats have a maximum life span of nearly 40 years, making them the world's longest-lived rodent. The new findings, published in the journal Science, could also shed light on why naked mole rats are resistant to a wide range of age-related diseases.

The animals are resistant to cancer, deterioration of the brain and spinal cord, and arthritis, so many scientists want to understand more about how their bodies work. For this study, led by a team at Tonji University in Shanghai, China, the focus was DNA repair - a natural process in our bodies' cells. When strands of DNA - our genetic building blocks - are damaged, a mechanism is triggered whereby another undamaged strand of DNA is used as a template to repair the break. The focus of this research was on a particular protein that is involved in that system of damage sensing and repair. When a cell senses the damage, one of the substances it produces is a protein called c-GAS. That plays several roles, but what was of interest to these scientists is that in humans, it interferes with and hampers the process by which DNA is knitted back together. Scientists think that this interference could promote cancer and shorten our lifespan. In naked mole rats though, the researchers found that the exact same protein does the opposite. It helps the body mend strands of DNA and keeps the genetic code in each cell intact. Whale menopause linked to longer lifespan

The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis for their work on quantum mechanics that is paving the way for a new generation of very powerful computers. ""There is no advanced technology used today that does not rely on quantum mechanics, including mobile phones, cameras... and fibre optic cables,"" said the Nobel committee. The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden. ""To put it mildly, it was a surprise of my life,"" said Professor John Clarke, who was born in Cambridge, UK and now works at the University of California in Berkeley.

Michel H. Devoret was born in Paris, France and is a professor at Yale University while John M. Martinis is a professor at University of California, Santa Barbara. The three winners will share prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (£872,000). The Nobel committee recognised breakthrough work performed by the three men in a series of experiments in the 1980s on electrical circuits. In the words of the committee, ""the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit"". Even for a field often considered dense, this discovery sounds bewildering.

But its implications have been profound and far-reaching. The electronic devices that most of us use rely on it, and the findings are being used to build extremely powerful computers. ""This is something that leads to development of the quantum computer. Many people are working on quantum computing, our discovery is in many ways the basis of this,"" said Prof Clarke on the phone to the news conference moments after he was told he had won. He appeared mystified that his work completed forty years ago is worthy of science's most prestigious prize. ""I'm completely stunned. At the time we did not realise in any way that this might be the basis for a Nobel prize,"" he said. Quantum mechanics relates to the behaviour of tiny things in a tiny world. It refers to what particles like the electron do in the sub-atomic world. Professor Clarke and his team looked at how these particles appeared to break rules like travelling through energy barriers that conventional physics said was impossible - something called ""tunnelling"". Using quantum ""tunnelling"", the electron manages to burrow through the energy barrier. Their work demonstrated that tunnelling can be reproduced not only in the quantum world, but also in electrical circuits in the 'real world'. This knowledge has been harnessed by scientists in making modern quantum chips. ""This is wonderful news indeed, and very well deserved,"" said Professor Lesley Cohen, Associate Provost in the Department of Physics at Imperial College London. ""Their work has laid the foundations for superconducting Qubits - one of the main hardware technologies for quantum technologies.""

When Matthias Huss first visited Rhône Glacier in Switzerland 35 years ago, the ice was just a short walk from where his parents would park the car. ""When I first stepped onto the ice... there [was] a special feeling of eternity,"" says Matthias. Today, the ice is half an hour from the same parking spot and the scene is very different. ""Every time I go back, I remember how it used to be,"" recalls Matthias, now director of Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland (GLAMOS), ""how the glacier looked when I was a child."" There are similar stories for many glaciers all over the planet, because these frozen rivers of ice are retreating - fast. In 2024, glaciers outside the giant ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost 450 billion tonnes of ice, according to a recent World Meteorological Organization report. That's equivalent to a block of ice 7km (4.3 miles) tall, 7km wide and 10km deep - enough water to fill 180 million Olympic swimming pools. ""Glaciers are melting everywhere in the world,"" says Prof Ben Marzeion of the Institute of Geography at the University of Bremen. ""They are sitting in a climate that is very hostile to them now because of global warming."" Switzerland's glaciers have been particularly badly hit, losing a quarter of their ice in the last 10 years, measurements from GLAMOS revealed this week. ""It's really difficult to grasp the extent of this melt,"" explains Dr Huss. But photos - from space and the ground - tell their own story. Satellite images show how the Rhône Glacier has changed since 1990, when Dr Huss first visited. At the front of the glacier is a lake where there used to be ice.

Until recently, glaciologists in the Alps used to consider 2% of ice lost in a single year to be ""extreme"". Then 2022 blew that idea out of the water, with nearly 6% of Switzerland's remaining ice lost in a single year. That has been followed by significant losses in 2023, 2024 and now 2025 too. Regine Hock, professor of glaciology at the University of Oslo, has been visiting the Alps since the 1970s. The changes over her lifetime are ""really stunning"", she says, but ""what we see now is really massive changes within a few years"". The Clariden Glacier, in north-eastern Switzerland, was roughly in balance until the late 20th Century - gaining about as much ice through snowfall as it lost to melting. But this century, it's melted rapidly.

For many smaller glaciers, like the Pizol Glacier in the north-east Swiss Alps, it's been too much. ""This is one of the glaciers that I observed, and now it's completely gone,"" says Dr Huss. ""It definitely makes me sad.""

Photographs allow us to look even further back in time. The Gries Glacier, in southern Switzerland near the Italian border, has retreated by about 2.2km (1.4 miles) in the past century. Where the end of the glacier once stood is now a large glacial lake.

In south-east Switzerland, the Pers Glacier once fed the larger Morteratsch Glacier, which flows down towards the valley. Now the two no longer meet.

And the largest glacier in the Alps, the Great Aletsch, has receded by about 2.3km (1.4 miles) over the past 75 years. Where there was ice, there are now trees.

Glaciers have grown and shrunk naturally for millions of years, of course. In the cold snaps of the 17th, 18th and 19th Centuries - part of the Little Ice Age - glaciers regularly advanced. During this time, many were considered cursed by the devil in Alpine folklore, their advances linked to spiritual forces as they threatened hamlets and farmland. There are even tales of villagers calling on priests to talk to the spirits of glaciers and get them to move up the mountain. Glaciers began their widespread retreat across the Alps in about 1850, though the timing varied from place to place. That coincided with rising industrialisation, when burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal, began to heat up our atmosphere, but it's hard to disentangle natural and human causes that far back in time. Where there is no real doubt is that the particularly rapid losses of the past 40 years or so are not natural.

Without humans warming the planet - by burning fossil fuels and releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) – glaciers would be expected to be roughly stable. ""We can only explain it if we take into account CO2 emissions,"" confirms Prof Marzeion. What is even more sobering is that these large, flowing bodies of ice can take decades to fully adjust to the rapidly warming climate. That means that, even if global temperatures stabilised tomorrow, glaciers would continue to retreat. ""A large part of the future melt of the glaciers is already locked in,"" explains Prof Marzeion. ""They are lagging climate change.""

But all is not lost. Half of the ice remaining across the world's mountain glaciers could be preserved if global warming is limited to 1.5C above ""pre-industrial"" levels of the late 1800s, according to research published this year in the journal Science. Our current trajectory is leading us towards warming of about 2.7C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century – which would see three-quarters of ice lost eventually. That extra water going into rivers and eventually the oceans means higher sea levels for coastal populations around the world. But the loss of ice will be particularly acutely felt by mountain communities dependent on glaciers for fresh water. Glaciers are a bit like giant reservoirs. They collect water as snowfall - which turns into ice - during cold, wet periods, and release it as meltwater during warm periods. This meltwater helps to stabilise river flows during hot, dry summers - until the glacier disappears. The loss of that water resource has knock-on effects for all those who rely on glaciers - for irrigation, drinking, hydropower and even shipping traffic. Switzerland is not immune from those challenges, but the implications are much more profound for the high mountains of Asia, referred to by some as the Third Pole due to the volume of ice. About 800 million people rely at least partly on meltwater from glaciers there, particularly for agriculture. That includes the upper Indus river basin, which serves parts of China, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. In regions with drier summers, meltwater from ice and snow can be the only significant source of water for months. ""That's where we see the biggest vulnerability,"" says Prof Hock. So how do scientists feel when confronted by the future prospects of glaciers in a warming world? ""It's sad,"" says Prof Hock. ""But at the same time, it's also empowering. If you decarbonise and reduce the [carbon] footprint, you can preserve glaciers. ""We have it in our hands.""

The Prince of Wales has described those in the running for his environmental Earthshot prize as ""heroes of our time"". Prince William will travel to Rio de Janeiro next month for the ceremony - the first time the awards have been hosted in Latin America. The prize, created by the prince five years ago, awards £1m every year to five projects for their environmental innovations. There have been almost 2,500 nominees this year from 72 countries - this year's winners will be chosen by Prince William and his Earthshot Prize Council which includes the actor, Cate Blanchett and Jordan's Queen Rania. This year's list of finalists range from a Caribbean country to small start-up businesses.

The Earthshot Prize is a 10-year project with past ceremonies held in London, Boston, Singapore and Cape Town. Kensington Palace confirmed earlier this year that the main awards ceremony will be held at Rio de Janeiro's Museum of Tomorrow on 5 November.

Barbados has been nominated for its global leadership on climate with the island on track to become fossil-free by 2030. The Chinese city of Guangzhou is shortlisted in the ""Clean our Air"" category for electrification of its public transport system. Prince William previously said he would like to take the Earthshot Prize to China. Finally, what has been billed as the world's first fully ""upcycled skyscraper"" makes the final list too. Sydney's Quay Quarter Tower was one of thousands of 20th century towers now reaching the end of their lifespans.

Instead of demolition, which releases vast amounts of carbon and waste, a coalition of architects, engineers, building contractors and developers has effectively ""upcycled"" the original structure. ""Matter"" is the only British finalist in the line-up. Based in Bristol, the business has developed a filter for washing machines removing the greatest cause of microplastics in our oceans. ""I feel like winning an Earthshot prize for me would be like winning an Olympic gold medal,"" said Adam Root, the founder of Matter.

Reuters In 2024, Actor Billy Porter and Earthshot ambassadors Robert Irwin and Nomzamo Mbatha joined the Prince of Wales on stage at the awards

In a video message released to mark the announcement of this year's finalists, he reflected on the past five years. ""Back then, a decade felt a long time. George was seven, Charlotte, five, and Louis two; the thought of them in 2030 felt a lifetime away,"" said Prince William. ""But today, as we stand halfway through this critical decade, 2030 feels very real. ""2030 is a threshold by which future generations will judge us; it is the point at which our actions, or lack of them, will have shaped forever the trajectory of our planet."" He added: ""The people behind these projects are heroes of our time, so let us back them. Because, if we do, we can make the world cleaner, safer and full of opportunity - not only for future generations, but for the lives we want to lead now.""",2025-11-14T17:19:23.653191

Watch: Jane Goodall tells BBC how she became interested in animals

She was a serene force of nature. And she never wavered in her mission to help the animals to which she dedicated her life. When I interviewed Dame Jane Goodall last year, she exuded calm, even as she pressed home to me that a great extinction crisis was facing our planet. Over a slightly blurry video call, I could see her toy monkey, Mr H, behind her. That toy was given to her nearly 30 years ago by a friend. Dr Goodall, who was 90 years old when we spoke, was still travelling the world with Mr H at her side. Researchers I've spoken to this evening, whose work Dr Goodall inspired, or who were simply inspired by her energy, are in shock at her death aged 91. Conservationist Dame Jane Goodall dies aged 91 Professor Cat Hobaiter, from the University of St Andrews, who has worked with Chimpanzees - studying their communication - for more than 15 years, told me that one reason Dr Goodall had such an impact was that ""she gave up doing what she loved - spending time with her beloved chimpanzees - to tirelessly travel the world and share her passion with everyone she met."" In the many years that Jane Goodall observed and studied chimpanzees, she revolutionised our understanding of our closest primate cousins. Key to her groundbreaking discoveries were her curiosity and ability - quietly - to observe.

It was during her time in the rainforest reserve at Gombe, in Tanzania, when she stopped to spend time watching a male chimpanzee who was foraging. The chimp took a twig, bent and stripped it of its leaves, then he poked it into a termite's nest. He then used that stripped, bent twig to spoon the termites into his mouth. That observation - in 1960 - challenged the belief that only humans made and used tools. Even as she changed our understanding of the natural world, Dr Goodall faced cynicism and sexism. She was not formally trained as a scientist. And, in the 1960s, that was unusual. Her work in Gombe went on to show that chimps also form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory. But her approach – associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as ""my friends"" - made her unpopular with the male-dominated scientific establishment. Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, saw the value in that informality. ""He wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,"" she said.

Watch: SpaceX Starship completes successful test flight

SpaceX has pulled off a successful test flight of its newest generation rocket Starship, reversing a trend of disappointing failures. The world's largest and most powerful rocket blasted off from Texas just after 18:30 local time (00:30 BST) for a nail-biting 60-minute flight. Parts of the engine appeared to explode at one stage, and flaps on the side of the rocket caught fire and swung from side-to-side. US space agency Nasa plans to use Starship to send humans to the Moon for its Artemis programme in 2027.

""Great work by the SpaceX team!!"", posted SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on X, who is spending billions on developing Starship, which each launch costing an estimated $100m. He will be welcoming the success after three Starship launches ended in spectacular failure this year, and one rocket exploded on its test stand in June. Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket built to date. It is made up of a booster called Super Heavy and the spacecraft Starship. The signs were positive from the start of Tuesday's test flight. All of the booster's 33 engines fired up, and after about seven minutes, the booster separated from the spacecraft and fell into the Gulf of Mexico. Starship continued to ascend, reaching a maximum height of almost 200km above Earth, before coasting around the planet. SpaceX said it intended to put the rocket under stress to test its limits, and parts of the rocket's flaps appeared to burn and swing wildly during the descent. The company has designed Starship to one day be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying people to the Moon and Mars. ""This was a great day for SpaceX, executing its full mission for the first time and deploying some test dummy satellites along the route,"" says Dr Simeon Barber, a planetary scientist at the Open University. He adds that SpaceX will have gathered a full set of data from take-off, cruising and landing, which is a big step forward for the company. The first version of the rocket had five successful launches, but all attempts to launch the newest version had ended in spectacular explosions. In March, one explosion grounded flights and caused debris to rain down over the Bahamas with pieces landing in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. But SpaceX did successfully execute the ""chopstick"" manoeuvre that caught the rocket booster in mechanical arms when it returned to Earth.

Watch: Moment Jim Lovell told earth ""Houston, we've had a problem"" as Apollo 13 suffered a fault

Astronaut Jim Lovell, who guided the Apollo 13 mission safely back to Earth in 1970, has died aged 97. Nasa said he had ""turned a potential tragedy into a success"" after an attempt to land on the Moon was aborted because of an explosion onboard the spacecraft while it was hundreds of thousands of miles from Earth. Tens of millions watched on television as Lovell and two other astronauts splashed back down into the Pacific Ocean, a moment which has become one of the most iconic in the history of space travel. Lovell, who was also part of the Apollo 8 mission, was the first man to go to the Moon twice - but never actually landed. Acting Nasa head Sean Duffy said Lovell had helped the US space programme to ""forge a historic path"". In a statement, Lovell's family said: ""We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind."" Tom Hanks, who played Lovell in the 1995 movie Apollo 13, called the astronaut one of those people ""who dare, who dream, and who lead others to the places we would not go on our own"". Hanks said in a statement on Instagram that Lovell's many voyages ""were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive"".

Teenage rocket maker

One Saturday, a 16-year-old hauled a heavy, three-foot tube into the middle of a large field in Wisconsin. He had persuaded his science teacher to help him make a makeshift rocket. Somehow, he had managed to get his hands on the ingredients for gunpowder - potassium nitrate, sulphur and charcoal. He pulled on a welder's helmet for protection. He packed it with powder, struck a match and ran like hell. The rocket rose 80 feet into the air and exploded. Had the chemicals been packed slightly differently, he would have been blown to pieces. For Jim Lovell, this was more than a childish lark. In achieving his dream to be a rocket scientist, he would become an American hero. But it was not going to be easy.

Getty Images The crew of the ill-fated Apollo 13: Jack Swigert, Jim Lovell and Fred Haise

James Arthur Lovell Jr was born on 25 March 1928 - just a year after Charles Lindbergh made his historic trip across the Atlantic. ""Boys like either dinosaurs or airplanes,"" he said. ""I was very much an airplane boy."" When he was five years old, his father died in a car accident. His mother, Blanche, worked all hours, struggling to keep food on the table. University was well beyond their financial reach.

The answer was the US Navy, which was hungry for new pilots after World War Two. It was not building rockets but at least it involved flying. Lovell signed up to a programme that sent him to college at the military's expense while training as a fighter pilot. Two years in, he gambled and switched to the Navy Academy at Annapolis, on Chesapeake Bay, in the hope of working with his beloved rockets. It was a lucky decision. A few months later, the Korean War broke out and his former fellow apprentice pilots were sent to South East Asia. Many never got to finish their education. Marriage was banned at Annapolis and girlfriends discouraged. The navy did not want its midshipmen wasting their time on such frivolities. But Lovell had a sweetheart. Marilyn Gerlach was the high school girl he had shyly asked to the prom. Women were not allowed on campus and trips outside were limited to 45 minutes. Somehow the relationship survived. Just hours after his graduation in 1952, the newly commissioned Ensign Lovell married her. They would be together for more than 70 years, until Marilyn's death in 2023.

Getty Images Jim and Marilyn Lovell were high school sweethearts

He did everything he could to advertise his love of rocketry. His thesis at the Navy Academy was in the unheard-of topic of liquid-fuel engines. After graduation, he hoped to specialise in this pioneering new technology. But the navy had other ideas. Lovell was assigned to an aircraft carrier group flying Banshee jets off ships at night. It was a white-knuckle, high-wire business fit only for daredevils. But for Lovell, it was not enough.

Kennedy's men

In 1958, he applied to Nasa. Project Mercury was America's attempt to place a man in orbit around the Earth. Jim Lovell was one of the 110 test pilots considered for selection but a temporary liver condition put paid to his chances. Four years later, he tried again. In June 1962, after gruelling medical tests, Nasa announced its ""New Nine"". These would be the men to deliver on President Kennedy's pledge to put American boots on the Moon. It was the most elite group of flying men ever assembled. They included Neil Armstrong, John Young and, fulfilling his childhood dream, Jim Lovell.

Getty Images Apollo 8 was Nasa's most dangerous mission yet

Three years later he was ready. His first trip into space was aboard the two-man Gemini 7. Lovell and fellow astronaut Frank Borman ate a steak-and-eggs breakfast and blasted off. Their mission: to find out if men could survive two weeks in space. If not, the Moon was out of reach. With the endurance record complete, Lovell's next flight was in command of Gemini 12 alongside space rookie Buzz Aldrin. This time they proved that man could work outside a spacecraft. Aldrin clambered awkwardly into the void, spending five hours photographing star fields. Now for the Moon itself. The crew of Apollo 8 would be the first to travel beyond low Earth orbit and enter the gravitational pull of another celestial body. It was Nasa's most dangerous mission yet.

'Get the camera'

The Saturn V rocket that shot Lovell, Borman and William Anders out of our atmosphere at 25,000mph (40,233km/h) was huge - three times larger than anything seen on the Gemini programme. As navigator, Lovell took with him a sextant to take star readings - in case the computers failed and they had to find their own way home. Sixty-eight hours after take-off, they made it. The engines fired and Apollo 8 slid silently behind the Moon. The men heard a crackle in their headsets as the radio signal to Mission Control faltered and then failed. The spellbound astronauts pinned themselves to the windows, the first humans to see the far side of our nearest celestial neighbour. And then, from over the advancing horizon, an incredible sight. ""Earthrise,"" gasped Borman. ""Get the camera, quick,"" said Lovell.

Getty Images The image of Earth from Space captivated the World

It was Christmas Eve 1968. America was mired in Vietnam abroad and civil unrest at home. But at that moment, it seemed that humanity was united. The people of the world saw their planet as the astronauts saw it - fragile and beautiful, shining in the desolation of space. Lovell read from the Book of Genesis, the basis of many of the world's great religions, to the people of the Earth. ""And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day."" For him, it was an image that changed our world forever. He put his thumb against the window and the whole world disappeared behind it. It was the most moving experience of his life. As the spacecraft re-emerged from the darkness, Lovell was first to announce the good news. ""Please be advised,"" he said as the radio crackled back into life, ""there is a Santa Claus."" At that very moment, 239,000 miles away, a man in a blue Rolls-Royce pulled up outside Lovell's house in Houston. He walked past the dozens of reporters camped outside and handed a box to Marilyn. She opened the star-patterned tissue paper and pulled out a mink jacket. ""Happy Christmas,"" said the card that came with it, ""and love from the Man in the Moon.""

There were ticker tape parades, congressional honours and a place on the cover of Time Magazine. And they had not even set foot on the Moon. That honour went, of course, to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. A year later, Kennedy's dream was posthumously seen to fruition. A small step was taken and mankind took its giant leap. The New Nine had done their job.

'Houston, we've had a problem'

In April 1970, it was Jim Lovell's turn. Fortunately, the crew of Apollo 13 did not believe in unlucky numbers. Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise were men of science - highly trained and determined to follow Armstrong and Aldrin to the lunar surface. But things went badly wrong. They were 200,000 miles above the Earth and closing in on their target when they needed to stir tanks containing vital oxygen and hydrogen. Swigert flicked the switch. It should have been a routine procedure but the command module, Odyssey, shuddered. Oxygen pressure fell and power shut down. ""I believe we've had a problem here,"" said Swigert. Lovell had to repeat the message to a stunned Mission Control: ""Houston, we've had a problem."" It was one of the greatest understatements of all time. The crew were in big trouble - a dramatic explosion had disabled their craft.

Haise and Lovell worked frantically to boot up the lunar module, Aquarius. It was not supposed to be used until they got to the Moon. It had no heat shield, so could not be used to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. But it could keep them alive until they got there. The world stopped breathing and watched. For a second time, Jim Lovell had brought the world together as one. The first time it had been for Earthrise, the second would be to witness his fight to survive. “For four days,"" said Marilyn, ""I didn’t know if I was a wife or a widow."" Temperatures fell to freezing, food and water were rationed. It was days before they limped back to the fringes of Earth's atmosphere. They climbed back aboard the Odyssey and prayed the heat shield had not been damaged. The radio silence that accompanies re-entry went on far longer than normal. Millions watched on TV, many convinced that all was lost. After six agonising minutes, Jack Swigert's voice cut through the silence. The team on the ground held its breath until the parachutes deployed and the crew was safely down. The mission was Nasa's greatest failure and, without question, its finest hour.

NASA Who will be the next human to leave their footprint on the surface of the Moon?

They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s. The death of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell, who guided the stricken mission safely back to Earth in 1970, means there are now just five people remaining who have escaped the relative safety of Earth orbit and ventured deeper into space. More than 50 years since a human last set foot on the Moon, the race to put people back on the lunar surface is heating up once again. Nasa hopes its Artemis programme will lead to astronauts living on the Moon this decade. China is also aiming to have people on the lunar surface by 2030, having landed a probe on the far side of the Moon in June 2024. A number of private companies have tried to send scientific craft to the Moon, although the mishaps have outnumbered the successes. Nasa had intended to launch Artemis 2, its first crewed lunar expedition since Apollo 17 in 1972, last year but that date has slipped into 2026, as the space agency says it needs more time to prepare. Meanwhile, companies such as SpaceX and Boeing continue to develop their own technology, although not without their setbacks. The issues with Boeing's Starliner which left two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station were embarrassing for the aerospace giant, while the ""rapid unscheduled disassemblies"" of SpaceX's Starship have become a customary sight to space watchers. These delays highlight the sad fact that the number of remaining Apollo astronauts is dwindling.

NASA Apollo 13 was Jim Lovell's final mission

Along with Frank Borman and Bill Anders, Jim Lovell made history when the three undertook the first lunar mission on Apollo 8, testing the Command/Service Module and its life support systems in preparation for the later Apollo 11 landing. Their craft actually made 10 orbits of the Moon before returning home. Lovell was later supposed be the fifth human to walk on the lunar surface as commander of Apollo 13 - but of course, that never happened. Instead the story of his brush with death was immortalised in the film Apollo 13, in which he was played by Tom Hanks.

Following his retirement from Nasa in 1973, Lovell worked in the telecoms industry. Marilyn, his wife of more than 60 years, who became a focus for the media during the infamous incident, died in August 2023. But what of the remaining five Moon men? Who are they, and what are their stories?

Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11)

On 21 July 1969, former fighter pilot Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin left his lunar landing craft and became the second person to step on the surface of the Moon. Almost 20 minutes beforehand, his commander, Neil Armstrong, had been the first. Aldrin's first words were: ""Beautiful view"". ""Isn't that something?"" asked Armstrong.""Magnificent sight out here."" ""Magnificent desolation,"" replied Aldrin. The fact that he was second never sat comfortably with him. His crewmate Michael Collins said Aldrin ""resented not being first on the Moon more than he appreciated being second"". But Aldrin was still proud of his achievement; many years later, when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, the 72-year-old Aldrin punched him on the jaw. And following Neil Armstrong's death in 2012, Aldrin said: ""I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew."" Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86.

While embracing his celebrity, he has remained an advocate for the space programme, especially the need to explore Mars. ""I don't think we should just go there and come back - we did that with Apollo,"" he says. And his name has become known to new generations as the inspiration for Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series of films. In January 2023, at the age of 93, he married for a fourth time..

Charles Duke (Apollo 16)

There are only four people still alive who have walked on the Moon - Charlie Duke is one of them. He did it aged 36, making him the youngest person to set foot on the lunar surface. In a later BBC interview, he spoke of a ""spectacular terrain"". ""The beauty of it… the sharp contrast between the blackness of space and the horizon of the Moon… I'll never forget it. It was so dramatic."" But he had already played another significant role in Nasa's exploration of the Moon. After Apollo 11 touched down in 1969, it was Duke - in mission control as the Capsule Communicator, or Capcom - who was waiting nervously on the other end of the line when Neil Armstrong said: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.""

In his distinctive southern drawl, Duke replied: ""Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again."" ""I really meant it, I was holding my breath the last minute or so,"" he later told the BBC. In 2022, Duke told the BBC he was excited about Nasa's Artemis mission - but warned that it wouldn't be easy for the new generation of astronauts. ""They've picked near the South Pole for the landing, because if there's any ice on the Moon, it would be down in that region. So that's gonna be difficult - because it's really rough down there. But we'll pull it off."" Charlie Duke now lives outside San Antonio, Texas, with Dorothy, to whom he has been married for 60 years.

Fred Haise

NASA Fred Haise and his crewmates seemed surprised by their celebrity after they returned to Earth.

Fred Haise was part of the crew of Apollo 13 that narrowly avoided disaster in 1970 after an on-board explosion caused the mission to be aborted when the craft was more than 200,000 miles (321,000km) from Earth. The whole world watched nervously as Nasa attempted to return the damaged spacecraft and its crew safely. Once back, Haise and his crewmates James Lovell and Jack Swigert became celebrities, to their apparent surprise. ""I feel like maybe I missed something while I was up there,"" he told talk show host Johnny Carson when the crew appeared on The Tonight Show. Haise never made it to the Moon. Although scheduled to be commander of Apollo 19, that mission was cancelled because of budget cuts, as were all other flights after Apollo 17. He later served as a test pilot on the prototype space shuttle, Enterprise. Like many of his fellow Apollo alumni, after leaving Nasa, Haise continued to work in the aerospace industry until his retirement.

Harrison Schmitt (Apollo 17)

NASA Harrison Schmitt was the first scientist to visit the Moon

Unlike most other astronauts of the time, Schmitt had not served as a pilot in the US forces. A geologist and academic, he initially instructed Nasa astronauts on what to look for during their geological lunar field trips before becoming a scientist-astronaut himself in 1965. Schmitt was part of the last crewed mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, and along with commander Eugene Cernan, one of the last two men to set foot on the lunar surface, in December 1972. After leaving Nasa in 1975, he was elected to the US Senate from his home state of New Mexico, but only served one term. Since then he has worked as a consultant in various industries as well as continuing in academia. He is also known for speaking out against the scientific consensus on climate change.

US space agency Nasa will fast-track plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030, according to US media. It is part of US ambitions to build a permanent base for humans to live on the lunar surface. According to Politico, the acting head of Nasa referred to similar plans by China and Russia and said those two countries ""could potentially declare a keep-out zone"" on the Moon. But questions remain about how realistic the goal and timeframe are, given recent and steep Nasa budget cuts, and some scientists are concerned that the plans are driven by geopolitical goals.

Nations including the US, China, Russia, India and Japan are rushing to explore the Moon's surface, with some planning permanent human settlements. ""To properly advance this critical technology to be able to support a future lunar economy, high power energy generation on Mars, and to strengthen our national security in space, it is imperative the agency move quickly,"" US transport secretary Sean Duffy, who was appointed temporary head of Nasa by President Donald Trump, wrote to Nasa, according to the New York Times. Mr Duffy called for proposals from commercial companies to build a reactor that could generate at least 100 kilowatts of power. This is relatively small. A typical on-shore wind turbine generates 2-3 megawatts. The idea of building a nuclear reactor as a power source on the Moon is not new. In 2022 Nasa issued three $5m contracts to companies to design a reactor. And in May this year, China and Russia announced they plan to build an automated nuclear power station on the Moon by 2035. Many scientists agree that it would be the best or perhaps only way to provide continuous power on the lunar surface. One lunar day is equivalent to four weeks on Earth, made up of two weeks of continual sunshine and two weeks of darkness. That makes relying on solar power very challenging.

CNSA/CLEP In 2020 China planted a flag on the Moon on its Chang'e-5 mission

""Building even a modest lunar habitat to accommodate a small crew would demand megawatt-scale power generation. Solar arrays and batteries alone cannot reliably meet those demands,"" suggests Dr Sungwoo Lim, senior lecturer in space applications, exploration and instrumentation at the university of Surrey ""Nuclear energy is not just desirable, it is inevitable,"" he adds. Lionel Wilson, professor of earth and planetary sciences at Lancaster University, believes it is technically possible to place the reactors on the Moon by 2030 ""given the commitment of enough money"", and he highlights that there are already designs for small reactors. ""It's just a matter of having enough Artemis launches to build the infrastructure on the Moon by then,"" he adds, referring to Nasa's Artemis spaceflight programme that aims to send people and equipment to the Moon. There are also some questions around safety. ""Launching radioactive material through the Earth's atmosphere brings safety concerns. You have to have a special license to do that, but it is not insurmountable,"" says Dr Simeon Barber, planetary science specialist at the Open University. Mr Duffy's directive came as a surprise following recent turmoil in Nasa after Mr Trump's administration announced cuts of 24% to Nasa's budgets in 2026. That includes cuts to a significant number of science programmes such as the Mars Sample Return that aims to return samples from the planet's surface to Earth.",2025-11-14T17:19:33.125441

Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft is likely to have re-entered the Earth's atmosphere after being stuck in orbit for more than half a century, the European Space Agency said. Kosmos 482, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit and instead broke into four pieces that have been circling the planet for more than five decades. The EU Space Surveillance and Tracking centre (SST) said one fragment - believed to be the lander - ""most likely"" re-entered the atmosphere at about 06:16 GMT (07:16 BST) on Saturday. It is unclear whether the object fell to the ground or burned up in the atmosphere.

It is also unclear exactly where the object re-entered the atmosphere. While there is much experts do not know about the object's re-entry, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to have caused significant damage. ""It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris,"" Stijn Lemmens, a senior analyst at the European Space Agency, said. Kosmos 482's lander capsule was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it had a robust heat shield and durable structure. This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere. However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space.",2025-11-14T17:19:35.942499

Listen to this article on BBC Sounds There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it. One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b. Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection. ""This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,"" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University. But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?

Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens

Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens. It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope. But decades on, what has been described as ""the strongest evidence yet"" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.

Reuters Nasa estimates that there are at least 100 billion planets in our galaxy

Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life is knowing where to look. Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system. Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.

Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life. But many are in what astronomers call ""The Goldilocks Zone"" where the distance is ""just right"" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.

Breathtakingly ambitious tech

As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious. The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures. And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes. Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.

NASA Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope detected the gas on K2-18b in this week's discovery

But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.) Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert. It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.

More discoveries, more questions

Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world. Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.

Reuters Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars

Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal. ""With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence"". The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time. In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.

A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue. The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way. The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome. China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.

NASA/ Reuters JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours

But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself. Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London. ""It is a long, slow process,"" she says. ""The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing. ""You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route"". Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles‘ song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with ""marmalade skies"". Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life. Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn? ""I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,"" she says, beaming with delight. ""Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.

Reducing human 'specialness'

If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there. Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be ""pretty common"" in the galaxy. ""But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.""

NASA The prospect of finding alien life is not far away, according to some scientists

Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life. ""When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms. ""The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?"" He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.

NASA Many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds

As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves ""more displaced"" from that point. ""I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,"" he says. Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul. ""The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe. ""If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger"".

NASA As exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres

Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan. ""When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene. ""It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,"" he continues. ""It will be another step in our evolution"". Top picture credit: Getty Images",2025-11-14T17:19:37.710508

Watch: Astronauts return to Earth after extended stay in Space

After nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have finally arrived back on Earth. Their SpaceX capsule made a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, before four parachutes opened to take them to a gentle splashdown off the coast of Florida. A pod of dolphins circled the craft. After a recovery ship lifted it out of the water, the astronauts beamed and waved as they were helped out of the hatch, along with fellow crew members astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.

""The crew's doing great,"" Steve Stich, manager, Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, said at a news conference. It brings to an end a mission that was supposed to last for just eight days. It was dramatically extended after the spacecraft Butch and Suni had used to travel to the International Space Station suffered technical problems. ""It is awesome to have crew 9 home, just a beautiful landing,"" said Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator, Nasa's Space Operations Mission Directorate. Thanking the astronauts for their resilience and flexibility, he said SpaceX had been a ""great partner"". The journey home took 17 hours. The astronauts were helped on to a stretcher, which is standard practice after spending so long in the weightless environment. They will be checked over by a medical team, and then reunited with their families.

NASA Triumphant - Suni Williams exits the capsule

""The big thing will be seeing friends and family and the people who they were expecting to spend Christmas with,"" said Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut. ""All of those family celebrations, the birthdays and the other events that they thought they were going to be part of - now, suddenly they can perhaps catch up on a bit of lost time."" The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024. They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing. But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home. Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return. So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September. It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six-month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.

WWF Krill are just a few centimetres long fully grown, but are one of the most abundant animals on Earth

Scientists say subtle differences in the colour of seawater will enable them to count tiny - but critically important - Antarctic marine creatures, from Space. The target of the new research effort is Antarctic krill, which are just a couple of inches long and one of the most abundant and important animals on the planet. Marine wildlife - including whales, penguins, seals and seabirds – all feed on these diminutive creatures. However, conservation scientists are concerned that fishing and climate change could be having a negative impact on them and say we need new ways to monitor the creatures.

""Antarctic krill are the superheroes of the Southern Ocean,"" said Rod Downie, chief polar adviser at the wildlife charity WWF-UK. ""They are tiny, unsung heroes that sustain incredible marine life, but climate change and unsustainable fishing are putting them at risk."" Researchers from the University of Strathclyde, WWF and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are developing a new way to use satellites to work out how many krill are in the ocean around Antarctica.

WWF The scientists have started by studying how krill change the colour of seawater

The key is in subtle differences in how much light seawater absorbs - depending on how many krill are swimming in it. Dr Cait McCarry, from the University of Strathclyde, has just returned from a trip to Antarctica, where she caught krill in order to measure this effect. ""We start with seawater, then we add in a krill and take a measurement [of how much light the water absorbs],"" she explained. ""Then we add another krill and take another measurement."" This analysis of exactly how the density of krill alters the colour of the ocean will, researchers say, allow them to take snapshots of the krill population from satellites - monitoring the population from Space.

NASA/Goddard/University of Arizona Asteroid Bennu is a 500m-wide pile of boulders, rocks and rubble

The chemical building blocks of life have been found in the grainy dust of an asteroid called Bennu, an analysis reveals. Samples of the space rock, which were scooped up by a Nasa spacecraft and brought to Earth, contain a rich array of minerals and thousands of organic compounds. These include amino acids, which are the molecules that make up proteins, as well as nucleobases - the fundamental components of DNA. This doesn't mean there was ever life on Bennu, but it supports the theory that asteroids delivered these vital ingredients to Earth when they crashed into our planet billions of years ago.

Scientists think those same compounds could also have been brought to other worlds in our Solar System. ""What we've learned from it is amazing,"" said Prof Sara Russell, a cosmic mineralogist from the Natural History Museum in London. ""It's telling us about our own origins, and it enables us to answer these really, really big questions about where life began. And who doesn't want to know about how life started?"" The findings are published in two papers in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy.

NASA/Erika Blumenfeld/Joseph Aebersold The grains of Bennu contain a vast array of organic molecules

Grabbing a bit of Bennu has been one of the most audacious missions Nasa has ever attempted. A spacecraft called Osiris Rex unfurled a robotic arm to collect some of the 500m-wide space rock, before packing it into a capsule and returning it to Earth in 2023. About 120g of black dust was collected and shared with scientists around the world. This might not sound like much material, but it's proved to be a treasure trove. ""Every grain is telling us something new about Bennu,"" said Prof Russell, who's been studying the tiny specks. About a teaspoonful of the asteroid was sent to scientists in the UK.

Natural History Museum/Tobias Salge Scanning electron microscopes revealed the minerals in the Bennu sample

The new research has shown that the space rock is packed full of nitrogen and carbon-rich compounds. These include 14 of the 20 amino acids that life on Earth uses to build proteins and all four of the ring-shaped molecules that make up DNA - adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. The study has also found an array of minerals and salts, suggesting water was once present on the asteroid. Ammonia, which is important for biochemical reactions, was discovered in the sample too. Some of these compounds have been seen in space rocks that have fallen to Earth, but others haven't been detected until now. ""It's just incredible how rich it is. It's full of these minerals that we haven't seen before in meteorites and the combination of them that we haven't seen before. It's been such an exciting thing to study,"" said Prof Russell.",2025-11-14T17:19:43.492703

""Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!"" Mr Musk posted on X, sharing a video showing a fiery trail streaking though the sky.

The Starship system had lifted off from Boca Chica, Texas, at 17:38 EST (22:38 GMT) in the company's seventh test mission.

The Starship upper stage separated from its Super Heavy booster nearly four minutes into flight as planned.

But then SpaceX communications manager Dan Huot reported on a live stream that mission teams had lost contact with the ship.

Watch: Lift-off for Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin as rocket New Glenn launches into orbit

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's space company has blasted its first rocket into orbit in a bid to challenge the dominance of Elon Musk's SpaceX. The New Glenn rocket launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 02:02 local time (07:02 GMT). It firmly pits the world's two richest men against each other in a commercial space race, vying to fly bigger and more powerful rockets. Both want to populate the skies with more satellites, run private space stations, and provide transport for regular trips by people to the Moon.

""Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!"" Musk wrote in a post to Bezos on X. Dave Limp, CEO of Bezos's space company Blue Origin, said he was ""incredibly proud"". ""We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring,"" he added. Bezos's team overcame technical barriers that caused delays earlier this week when ice formation halted a launch. Blue Origin's employees and crowds gathered near Cape Canaveral cheered as the 98 meters-high rocket hurtled into orbit. But the company failed to land New Glenn's main rocket engine, or booster, onto a platform in the Atlantic Ocean. It had hoped that the booster would be reusable for future launches but after about 20 minutes of flight, the company confirmed it had lost the engine. Bezos's company Blue Origin has struggled to match the pace set by SpaceX. But this launch will be seen as a major step forward for the business. The New Glenn rocket was named after John Glenn, the first American astronaut to orbit Earth more than 60 years ago. The rocket is more powerful than SpaceX's most commonly used rocket, the Falcon 9. It can also carry more satellites, and Bezos wants to use it as part of his Project Kuiper, which aims to deploy thousands of low-earth satellites to provide broadband services. That project would compete directly with Musk's Starlink service.

Blue Origin Media New Glenn is 98 metres high

Jeff Bezos founded Blue Origin 25 years ago, claiming he wanted ""millions of people working and living in space."" For years the venture has sent a smaller, reusable rocket called New Shepard to the edge of Earth's atmosphere. It has carried passengers and payloads, including Bezos himself in 2021. But Blue Origin has been dramatically outperformed by SpaceX, which launched its rockets 134 times last year. And SpaceX's new generation of rocket, called Starship, is more powerful still. The company hopes to launch it in its seventh test flight later today.

Starship is even bigger than Blue Origin's New Glenn

Some experts say a successful New Glenn rocket will create real competition between the two companies and could drive down the costs of space operations. ""What you are going to see are these two companies challenge each other to make even greater strides,"" suggests Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University in the UK.

On Christmas Eve, an autonomous spacecraft flew past the Sun, closer than any human-made object before it. Swooping through the atmosphere, Nasa's Parker Solar Probe was on a mission to discover more about the Sun, including how it affects space weather on Earth. This was a landmark moment for humanity – but one without any human directly involved, as the spacecraft carried out its pre-programmed tasks by itself as it flew past the sun, with no communication with Earth at all. Robotic probes have been sent across the solar system for the last six decades, reaching destinations impossible for humans. During its 10-day flyby, the Parker Solar Probe experienced temperatures of 1000C. But the success of these autonomous spacecraft – coupled with the rise of new advanced artificial intelligence – raises the question of what role humans might play in future space exploration.

Some scientists question whether human astronauts are going to be needed at all. ""Robots are developing fast, and the case for sending humans is getting weaker all the time,"" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal. ""I don't think any taxpayer's money should be used to send humans into space."" He also points to the risk to humans. ""The only case for sending humans [there] is as an adventure, an experience for wealthy people, and that should be funded privately,"" he argues. Andrew Coates, a physicist from University College London, agrees. ""For serious space exploration, I much prefer robotics,"" he says. ""[They] go much further and do more things.""

They are also cheaper than humans, he argues. ""And as AI progresses, the robots can be cleverer and cleverer."" But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts – and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could?

Rovers versus mankind

Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon. In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket). ""Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,"" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. ""It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant."" But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science.

NASA The Earthrise photo was taken by US astronaut William Anders in December 1968 during the Apollo 8 mission

Robots can contribute to that scientific research, with the ability to travel to locations inhospitable to humans, where they can use instruments to study and probe the atmospheres and surfaces. ""Humans are more versatile and we get stuff done faster than a robot, but we're really hard and expensive to keep alive in space,"" says Dr Weinersmith. In her 2024 Booker Prize-winning novel Orbital, author Samantha Harvey puts it more lyrically: ""A robot has no need for hydration, nutrients, excretion, sleep… It wants and asks for nothing."" But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical – for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph. ""AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?"" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. ""I just don't think we know."" He does, however, believe that AI algorithms might enable rovers to be ""more efficient"".

AI assistants and humanoid robots

Technology can play a part in complementing human space travel by freeing up astronauts from certain tasks to allow them to focus on more important research. ""[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,"" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. ""On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't."" The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. ""We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,"" says Dr Wagstaff. ""The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has"" – meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM. Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans.

NASA Nasa's Valkyrie humanoid robot

Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities. Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa's Robonaut was the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans. Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems. A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly.

Reuters Valkyrie demonstrates how it is able to open a bag

""If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,"" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. ""We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around."" He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them. Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input. ""You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,"" says Dr Wagstaff. ""It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep.""

NASA Nasa's Perseverance Mars rover takes a ""selfie""

But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot. ""Inspiration is something that is intangible,"" argues Prof Coates. Leroy Chiao, a retired Nasa astronaut who went on three flights to space in the 1990s and 2000s on Nasa's Space Shuttle and to the International Space Station, agrees. ""Humans relate when humans are doing something. ""The general public is excited about robotic missions. But I would expect the first human on Mars to be even bigger than the first Moon landing.""

Life on Mars?

Humans have not travelled further than Earth's orbit since December 1972, when the last Apollo mission visited the Moon. Nasa is hoping to return humans there this decade with its Artemis programme. The next crewed mission will see four astronauts fly around the Moon in 2026. A further mission, scheduled for 2027, will see Nasa astronauts land on the Moon's surface.

Reuters Astronauts for NASA's Artemis II mission

The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon. Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans could land. His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to be a million people on Mars in 20 years. ""Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,"" explains Dr Weinersmith. ""If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary."" However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved. ""Maybe babies can't develop in that environment,"" she says. ""There [are] ethical questions [like this] that we don't have the answers to. ""I think we should be slowing down."" Lord Rees has a vision of his own, though, in which human and robotic exploration might merge to the point that humans themselves are part-machine to cope with extreme environments. ""I can imagine they will use all of the techniques of genetic modification, cyborg add-ons, and so on, to cope with very hostile environments,"" he says. ""We may have a new species that will be happy to live on Mars."" Until then, however, humans are likely to continue their small steps into the cosmos, on a path long trodden by robotic explorers before them. Top image credit: NASA",2025-11-14T17:19:48.713933

SPL Artwork: Uranus and its five largest moons had been thought to be inactive and sterile.

The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought. Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say. Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa’s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago. But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like. Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds – as if it had been knocked over – making it arguably the weirdest.

We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons. But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought. The measurements from the spacecraft’s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus’s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun. A planet’s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive. This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system’s other planets and their moons.

NASA Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 to study Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune

But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day. The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field. So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London. “These results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!”.

NASA The first picture of Uranus was sent back by Voyager 2 in 1986

Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy. “The results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,” she told BBC News. “I’m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It’s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries”. Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as “very exciting”. “It shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions”. Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research. It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years’ time.

Shutterstock Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva speaks during the opening of the COP30 conferences in Belem, Brazil.

The world must ""defeat"" climate denialism and fight fake news, Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has told the opening meeting of the UN climate talks. In a rallying cry to COP30, President Lula again made thinly veiled references to President Donald Trump who branded climate change ""a con job"" in September. The two weeks of talks kicked off on Monday in the lush Brazilian city of Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. They take place against a fraught political backdrop and the US has sent no senior officials.

On Monday thousands of delegates poured into the COP venue in a heavily air-conditioned former aerodrome, some coming from accommodation in shipping containers and cruise ships moored on the riverside. Members of the Guajajara indigenous group, in traditional dress, performed a welcome song and dance for assembled diplomats. Addressing the conference, President Lula said ""COP30 will be the COP of truth"" in an era of ""fake news and misrepresentation"" and ""rejection of scientific evidence"". Without naming President Trump, President Lula continued, ""they control the algorithms, sow hatred and spread fear"". ""It's time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers,"" he said.

Since President Trump took office in January, he has promised to invest heavily in fossil fuels, saying that this will secure greater economic prosperity for the US. His administration has cancelled more than $13bn of funding for renewable energy and is taking steps to open up more areas of the US to oil and gas exploration. That puts the country at odds with the majority of nations still committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in green energy.

UNFCC The latest UN climate talks talk place in Belém, a city of 1.5 million people in northern Brazil

This backdrop has put the COP talks in a difficult position as nations aim to make progress on tackling climate change without the participation of the world's biggest economy. Some delegates fear that the US could still decide to send officials to undermine the talks. Other environmental talks collapsed this year following US pressure, labelled ""bully-boy tactics"" by some participants. Addressing officials in Belém, UN climate chief Simon Stiell initially struck an optimistic tone. He said significant progress had been made in the last decade to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases. But then he took aim at ""squabbling"" between countries. ""Not one single nation among you can afford this, as climate disasters rip double-digits off GDP,"" he said. Brazil wants to use its presidency of the talks to secure progress on key promises made in previous years. That includes moving away from the use of planet-warming fossil fuels, finance for developing countries on the frontline of climate change, and protecting nature. President Lula's centrepiece is a fund called the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) that Brazil hopes will raise $125bn to protect tropical forests globally. Fund-raising got off to a slow start. Last week UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, at the last minute, that the UK would not contribute public money. But on Monday, UK climate envoy Rachel Kyte told BBC News that the fund was a ""brilliant idea"" and that the UK ""will make the investment at some point"".",2025-11-14T17:19:52.922953

What a far cry from the family photograph taken on Thursday with this year's line-up at the COP30 summit in Brazil. Xi and Modi were no-shows, along with the leaders of around 160 other countries. And notably absent was the US President Donald Trump. In fact, the Trump administration has exited the process entirely and has said it will not send any high-level officials this year. Which raises the question, why have a two-week-long multinational gathering at all if so many leaders aren’t there? Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN's climate process under whose leadership the Paris Agreement was struck, said during last year's gathering that the COP process was ""not fit for purpose."" ""The golden era for multilateral diplomacy is over,"" agrees Joss Garman, a former climate activist who now heads a new think tank called Loom.

""Climate politics is now more than ever about who captures and controls the economic benefits of new energy industries,"" he tells me. So, with carbon dioxide emissions still rising even after 29 of these meetings - which are, after all, aimed at bringing them down - will more COPs make any difference?

Trump and the climate 'con job'

On his first day back in office, Trump used his trademark marker pen to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, the 2015 UN treaty under which nations agreed to work together to try to keep global warming below 1.5°C. ""This 'climate change' - it's the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,"" he told the UN General Assembly in September. ""If you don't get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail."" He has rolled back restrictions on oil, gas, and coal, signed billions of dollars of tax breaks for fossil fuel firms, and opened up federal lands for extraction. Plus Trump and his team have called on governments around the world to abandon their ""pathetic"" renewable energy programmes and buy US oil and gas - in some cases with the risk of punitive tariffs if they don't. Japan and South Korea as well as Europe have agreed to buy tens of billions of US hydrocarbons. The objective is clear: Trump says he wants to make the US the ""number one energy superpower in the world"". Meanwhile, he has set about dismantling his predecessor Joe Biden's clean energy agenda.

Subsidies and tax breaks for wind and solar have been slashed, permits withdrawn, projects cancelled. Research funding has been cut too. ""Wind power in the United States has been subsidised for 33 years - isn't that enough?"" US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said when I asked him to explain the administration's policy when we met in September. ""You've got to be able to walk on your own after 25 to 30 years of subsidies."" John Podesta, a senior adviser on climate to both Obama and Biden, sees it differently. ""The United States is taking a wrecking ball to clean energy,"" he argues. “They're trying to take us back not to the 20th Century, but the 19th.""

AFP via Getty Images ""This 'climate change' - it's the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,"" President Trump said in September

Last month, a landmark deal that would have cut global shipping emissions was abandoned after the US, along with Saudi Arabia, succeeded in ending the talks. Many supporters of the COP talks are concerned. What happens if the US path leads to other countries dialling down their commitments? Anna Aberg, a Research Fellow in Chatham House's Environment and Society Centre, describes COP as ""taking place in a really difficult political context"" given Trump's position. ""I think it's more important than ever that this COP sends some kind of signal to the world that there are still governments and businesses and institutions that are acting on climate change.”

It’s too late to win at table tennis

Trump's strategy puts the US on a collision course with China, which has also been working for decades to dominate the world's energy supplies - but through clean technology. In 2023, clean technologies drove roughly 40% of China's economic growth, according to the climate website Carbon Brief. After a slight slowdown last year, renewables accounted for a quarter of all new growth and now make up more than 10% of the entire economy. And, like Trump's America, China is engaging internationally well beyond participation in COP - it is taking its entire energy model global.

The split has transformed the climate debate. It is now one that pits the world's two superpowers against each other for control of the most essential industry on Earth. And it leaves the UK and Europe - as well as major emerging powers like India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil - caught in the middle. Speaking at this year‘s conference, a source in government at a major developed country said: “Of all the things they're most terrified of, the biggest is being seen to criticise Trump.” The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, warned last month that Europe must not repeat what she termed the mistakes of the past and lose another strategic industry to China. She called the loss of Europe's solar manufacturing base to cheaper Chinese rivals ""a cautionary tale we must not forget"".

The European Commission has forecasted that the market for renewables and other clean energy sources will grow from €600bn (£528bn) to €2 trillion (£1.74tn) within a decade and wants Europe to capture at least 15% of that. But that ambition may come too late. ""China is already the world's clean-tech superpower,"" says Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Policy Institute. Its dominance in solar, wind, EVs, and advanced battery technologies, he says, is now ""virtually unassailable”. He likens it to trying to beat the Chinese national team at table tennis: ""If you want to surpass China, you had to get your act together 25 years ago. If you want to do it now, you have no hope.""

AFP via Getty Images America and China are taking very different paths on energy

China produces over 80% of the world's solar panels, a similar share of advanced batteries, 70% of EVs, and more than 60% of wind turbines - all at phenomenally low prices. The EU's recent move to raise tariffs on Chinese EVs reflects the scale of the dilemma. Open the market and Europe's car industry could collapse; close it and green targets may not be met. Restricting Chinese access to these markets may slow emissions reductions, says Joss Garman, but he argues, ""If we ignore questions about economic security, jobs, national security, that risks undermining public and political support for the entire climate effort.""

COP: New purpose or pointless?

Now, with these shifts in direction of global politics and priorities, Anna Aberg says she expects COP to become an annual forum for ""holding to account"" countries and other organisations, something she believes remains an ""important role”. The gathering in Brazil follows the acknowledgement by UN Secretary-General António Guterres that the 1.5°C target set in Paris will be breached - this, he has said, represents ""deadly negligence"" on the part of the world community. Last year was the hottest ever recorded, and 60 leading climate scientists said in June that the Earth could breach 1.5°C in as little as three years at current levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Yet more people are questioning the need for an annual gathering. ""I think we need one big COP every five years. And between that, I'm not sure what COP is for,"" says Michael Liebreich, founder of energy consultancy Bloomberg New Energy Finance and host of a green energy podcast, Cleaning Up. ""You can't just expect politicians to go and make more and more commitments. You need time for industries to develop and for things to happen. You need the real economy to catch up.""

Last year was the first on record when global average air temperatures were more than 1.5C above those of the late 1800s. A single 12-month period isn't considered a breach of the Paris agreement, however, with the record heat of 2024 given an extra boost by natural weather patterns

He believes it would be much more productive for the discussions to happen in smaller meetings focused on removing barriers to clean energy. But he also believes that some issues, like implementation, need to be discussed in places he deems more relevant - like on Wall Street ""where people can actually fund stuff” - as opposed to on the edge of the Brazilian rainforest. Even so, this will be important negotiations at this year's COP. Among other things, it aims to get an agreement for a multi-billion-dollar fund to support the world's rainforests like the Amazon and the Congo Basin. Michael Jacobs, who advised Gordon Brown on climate policy and is now a politics professor at Sheffield University, believes that continued collective support for the process is crucial. ""It's a big political message, because Donald Trump is trying to undermine the collective process, but it's also a message to businesses that they should continue to invest in decarbonisation because governments will continue to enact climate policies.""

The UK's Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband believes these meetings have delivered real progress by getting countries to engage with tackling climate change and enact policies that have made the renewable revolution possible. ""It's dry, it's complicated, it's anguished, it's tiring,” he says - “and it's absolutely necessary”. Many now do, however, accept there is a strong argument for these international gatherings to be scaled down. Ultimately, however, the real choice underlying it, for so many nations in attendance, simply comes down to the extent to which they align with a China-led clean energy revolution - or double down on the fossil fuels–first agenda. Which is why many observers say the process of decarbonisation is going to be less about the multi-country commitments of COPs past, and far more about big-money deals between individual countries as we look ahead to this year’s summit - and how COPs may well play out in the future.

3 November 2025 Share Save Mark Poynting Climate and science reporter, BBC News Share Save

Naomi Ochwat Hektoria Glacier in February 2024, flowing into the partly frozen ocean

When an Antarctic glacier was sparked into rapid retreat three years ago, it left scientists scratching their heads as to what might have caused it. Hektoria Glacier retreated by more than 8km (5 miles) in just two months in late 2022 - and now a new study claims to have the answer. The authors believe that Hektoria could be the first modern example of a process where the front of a glacier resting on the seabed rapidly destabilises. That could lead to much faster sea-level rise if it happened elsewhere in Antarctica, they say. But other scientists argue that this part of the glacier was actually floating in the ocean – so while the changes are impressive, they are not so unusual.

Floating tongues of glaciers extending into the sea – called ice shelves – are much more prone to breaking up than glacier fronts resting on the seabed. That's because they can be more easily eaten away by warm water underneath.

Solving the 'whodunnit'

That Hektoria has undergone huge change is not contested. Its front retreated by about 25km (16 miles) between January 2022 and March 2023, satellite data shows. But unravelling the causes is like a ""whodunnit"" mystery, according to study lead author Naomi Ochwat, research affiliate at the University of Colorado Boulder and post-doctoral researcher at the University of Innsbruck.

The case began way back in 2002 with the extraordinary collapse of an ice shelf called Larsen B in the eastern Antarctic Peninsula. About 3250 sq km (1250 sq miles) of ice shelf was lost, roughly the size of Cambridgeshire or Gloucestershire. Larsen B had been effectively holding Hektoria Glacier back. Without it, Hektoria's movement sped up and the glacier thinned. But the bay vacated by the ice shelf was eventually filled with sea-ice ""fastened"" to the seabed, helping to partly stabilise Hektoria. That was until early 2022, when the sea-ice broke up.

British Antarctic Survey The view from an aircraft of Evans, Green and Hektoria Glaciers in January 2022 as they flow into the sea-ice-filled ocean, before the rapid retreat

What followed was further loss of floating ice from the front of Hektoria, as large, flat-topped icebergs broke off or ""calved"", and the ice behind sped up and thinned. That is not unusual. Iceberg calving is a natural part of ice sheet behaviour, even though human-caused climate change makes the loss of ice shelves much more likely. What was unprecedented, the authors argue, was what happened in late 2022, when they suggest the front of the glacier was ""grounded"" - resting on the seabed - rather than floating. In just two months, Hektoria retreated by 8.2km. That would be nearly ten times faster than any grounded glacier recorded before, according to the study, published in Nature Geoscience.

This extraordinary change, the authors say, could be thanks to an ice plain - a relatively flat area of bedrock on which the glacier lightly rests. Upward forces from the ocean water could ""lift"" the thinning ice essentially all at once, they argue - causing icebergs to break off and the glacier to retreat in quick time. ""Glaciers don't usually retreat this fast,"" said co-author Adrian Luckman, professor of geography at Swansea University. ""The circumstances may be a little particular, but this rapid retreat shows us what may happen elsewhere in Antarctica where glaciers are lightly grounded, and sea-ice loses its grip,"" he added.

What makes this idea even more tantalising is that this process has never been observed in the modern world, the authors say. But markings on the seafloor suggest it may have triggered rapid ice loss into the ocean in the Earth's past. ""What we see at Hektoria is a small glacier, but if something like that were to happen in other areas of Antarctica, it could play a much larger role in the rate of sea-level rise,"" said Dr Ochwat. That could include Thwaites – the so-called ""doomsday"" glacier because it holds enough ice to raise global sea-levels by 65cm (26in) if it melted entirely. ""It's really important to understand whether or not there are other ice plain areas that would be susceptible to this kind of retreat and calving,"" Dr Ochwat added.

Other scientists unconvinced

But other researchers have contested the study's findings. The controversy surrounds the position of the ""grounding line"" or ""grounding zone"" - where the glacier loses contact with the seabed and starts to float in the ocean. ""This new study offers a tantalising glimpse into what could be the fastest rate of retreat ever observed in modern-day Antarctica,"" said Dr Frazer Christie, glaciologist and senior Earth observation specialist at Airbus Defence and Space. ""But there is significant disagreement within the glaciological community about the precise location of Hektoria Glacier's grounding line because it's so difficult to get accurate records from radar satellites in this fast-flowing region,"" he added. The location of the grounding line may sound trivial, but it is crucial to determine whether the change was truly unprecedented. ""If this section of the ice sheet was in fact floating [rather than resting on the seabed], the punchline would instead be that icebergs calved from an ice shelf, which is much less unusual behaviour,"" said Dr Christine Batchelor, senior lecturer in physical geography at Newcastle University. ""I think the mechanism and rate of retreat proposed are plausible in Antarctic ice plain settings, but because of uncertainty about where the grounding zone was located at Hektoria, I am not fully convinced that this has been observed here,"" she added. But where there is little debate is that the fragile white continent – once thought largely immune from the impacts of global warming – is now changing before our eyes. ""While we disagree about the process driving this change at Hektoria, we are in absolute agreement that the changes in the polar regions are scarily rapid, quicker than we expected even a decade ago,"" said Anna Hogg, professor of Earth observation at the University of Leeds. ""We must collect more data from satellites, so that we can better monitor and understand why these changes are occurring and what their implications are [for sea-level rise].""

Only 64 countries have submitted new plans to cut carbon, the UN says, despite all being required to do so ahead of next month's COP30 summit. Added together these national pledges would fail to keep the world from warming by more than 1.5C, a key threshold to very dangerous levels of climate change. While the UN review does show progress in curbing carbon emissions over the next decade, the projected fall is not enough to stop temperatures surging past this global target. The report underlines the scale of the task facing world leaders who head to Belém in northern Brazil next week for the COP30 climate gathering.

Ten years after the Paris climate pact was agreed in 2015, the efforts of countries to restrict the rise in global temperatures are under renewed scrutiny. Every signatory agreed to submit a new carbon-cutting plan every five years, which would cover the next decade. But only 64 countries managed to put a new pledge in place this year, despite many extensions of the deadline. These represent around 30% of global emissions. In addition, the UN's review includes statements from China and the EU on their future plans made at Climate Week in New York in September. Taken together, the efforts mean that global emissions of carbon dioxide should fall by around 10% by 2035. However, scientists say that such a drop is nowhere near enough to keep the rise in temperatures under 1.5C. To keep that goal alive will require steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, up to 57% by 2035, according to the UN last year. ""This report shows that we are going in the right direction but too slowly,"" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, often referred to as a key architect of the Paris Agreement. ""It is essential to acknowledge the missing national pledges and confront the persistent gap between ambition and actual implementation."" The 1.5C limit, agreed at Paris, has long been seen as the threshold of very dangerous warming. In 2018, scientists outlined the massive benefits to the world of keeping the rise under 1.5C as compared to allowing them to rise to 2C. Passing 1.5C include more frequent and intense heatwaves and storms, increased damage to coral reefs and growing threats to human health and livelihoods, UN scientists have said. However, that limit was breached in 2024 for a whole year for the first time. UN leaders are increasingly accepting the fact that the threshold will be breached permanently by the early 2030s at current rates.

""One thing is already clear: we will not be able to contain the global warming below 1.5C in the next few years,"" UN secretary general António Guterres told delegates at a meeting of the World Meteorological Organisation last week. ""Overshooting is now inevitable. Which means that we're going to have a period, bigger or smaller, with higher or lower intensity, above 1.5C in the years to come."" Despite this, the UN is keen to stress that there are some significant green shoots in the new report that provide hope. Many more countries are expected to lodge plans as their leaders gather for COP30 in Belém in Brazil. Large carbon producers such as India and Indonesia haven't yet unveiled their carbon plans. They will likely do so during COP30 and these may have a significant impact on the overall projections for 2035. Some countries are also likely to cut faster and deeper than they've promised, say experts. ""It's actually completely reasonable to look at China,"" said Todd Stern, former US Special Envoy for climate change. ""They'll put down a certain number, which is not great, and then they will overachieve it, and China does that a lot."" The UN says they are confident that emissions globally will likely peak and start to decline in the next few years, for the first time since the industrial revolution in the 19th century. They say the plans in place show clear stepping stones to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. Net zero means balancing the amount of planet-warming ""greenhouse"" gases produced by human activities with the amount being actively removed from the atmosphere. One important factor is that the cuts assessed by the UN include the planned US pledge submitted under President Biden. While President Donald Trump has said he will pull out of the Paris agreement, that process is not completed yet, so the UN are keeping the US plans in their calculations even if these won't happen as planned.",2025-11-14T17:19:58.165173

BBC/Hosu Lee Boat owner Hong Suk-hui says the seas are becoming more dangerous

Hong Suk-hui was waiting on the shore of South Korea's Jeju Island when the call came. His fishing boat had capsized. Just two days earlier, the vessel had ventured out on what he had hoped would be a long and fruitful voyage. But as the winds grew stronger, its captain was ordered to turn back. On the way to port, a powerful wave struck from two directions creating a whirlpool, and the boat flipped. Five of the 10 crew members, who had been asleep in their cabins below deck, drowned. ""When I heard the news, I felt like the sky was falling,"" said Mr Hong. Last year, 164 people were killed or went missing in accidents in the seas around South Korea – a 75% jump from the year before. Most were fishermen whose boats had sunk or capsized. ""The weather has changed, it's getting windier every year,"" said Mr Hong, who also chairs the Jeju Fishing Boat Owners Association. ""Whirlwinds pop up suddenly. We fisherman are convinced it is down to climate change.""

South Korean Coastguard Five of Mr Hong's crew members drowned when this fishing boat capsized in February

Alarmed by the spike in deaths, the South Korean government launched an investigation into the accidents. This year, the head of the taskforce pinpointed climate change as one of the major causes, as well as highlighting other problems - the country's aging fishing workforce, a growing reliance on migrant workers, and poor safety training. The seas around Korea are warming more rapidly than the global average, in part because they tend to be shallower. Between 1968 and 2024, the average surface temperature of the country's seas increased by 1.58C, more than double the global rise of 0.74C. Warming waters are contributing to extreme weather at sea, creating the conditions for tropical storms, like typhoons, to become more intense. They are also causing some fish species around South Korea to migrate, according to the country's National Institute of Fisheries Science, forcing fisherman to travel further and take greater risks to catch enough to make a living. Environmental campaigners say urgent action is needed to ""stop the tragedy occurring in Korean waters"".

BBC/Hosu Lee Some fish species are migrating from the waters around South Korea

On a rainy June morning, Jeju Island's main harbour was crammed with fishing boats. The crews hurried back and forth between sea and land, refuelling and stocking up for their next voyage, while the boats' owners paced anxiously along the dock watching the final preparations. ""I'm always afraid something might happen to the boat, the risks have increased so much,"" said 54-year-old owner, Kim Seung-hwan. ""The winds have become more unpredictable and extremely dangerous."" A few years ago, Mr Kim began to notice that the popular silvery hairtail fish he relied on were disappearing from local waters, and his earnings plunged by half. Now his crews have to journey into deeper, more perilous waters to find them, sometimes sailing as far south as Taiwan. ""Since we're operating farther away, it's not always possible to return quickly when there's a storm warning,"" he said. ""If we stayed closer to shore it would be safer, but to make a living we have to go farther out.""

BBC/Hosu Lee Fishermen on South Korea's Jeju Island say hairtail fish have become scarcer

Professor Gug Seung-gi led the investigation into the recent accidents, which found that South Korea's seas appear to have become more dangerous. It noted the number of marine weather warnings around the Korean Peninsula - alerting fishermen to gales, storm surges, and typhoons - increased by 65% between 2020 and 2024. ""Unpredictable weather is leading to more boats capsizing, especially small fishing vessels that are going further out and are not built for such long, rough trips,"" he told the BBC. Professor Kim Baek-min, a climate scientist at South Korea's Pukyong National University, said that although climate change was creating the conditions to make strong, sudden wind gusts more likely, a clear trend had not yet been established – for that, more research and long-term data is needed.

BBC/Hosu Lee Captain Park fishes for anchovies from this small boat

One foggy morning, we left shore in the dark on a small trawler with Captain Park Hyung-il, who has been fishing anchovies off Korea's south coast for more than 25 years. He sang sea shanties, determined to stay upbeat. But when we reached the nets he had left out overnight, his mood crumpled. As he wound them in, the anchovies could barely be seen among the hordes of jellyfish and other fodder. Once the anchovies had been separated out, they filled just two boxes. ""In the past, we'd fill 50 to 100 of these baskets in a single day,"" he said. ""But this year the anchovies have vanished and we're catching more jellyfish than fish."" This is the predicament facing tens of thousands of fishermen along South Korea's coastlines. Over the past 10 years, the amount of squid caught in South Korean waters each year has plummeted 92%, while anchovy catches have fallen by 46%.

BBC/Hosu Lee There are far fewer anchovies to be sorted by fishing workers

Even the anchovies Park had caught were not fit for market, he said, and would need to be sold as animal-feed. ""The haul is basically worthless,"" he sighed, explaining it would barely cover the day's fuel costs, let alone his crew's wages. ""The sea is a mess, nothing makes sense anymore,"" Park continued. ""I used to love this job. There was joy knowing that someone, somewhere in the country was eating the fish I caught. But now, with barely anything to catch, that sense of pride is fading."" And, with livelihoods disappearing, young people no longer want to join the industry. In 2023 almost half of South Korea's fishermen were over the age of 65, up from less than a third a decade earlier. Increasingly, elderly captains must rely on help from migrant workers from Vietnam and Indonesia. Often these workers do not receive sufficient safety training, and language barriers mean they cannot communicate with the captains – further compounding the dangers. Woojin Chung, South Korea's chief representative at the UK-based Environmental Justice Foundation, described it as ""a vicious and tragic cycle"". When you combine more extreme weather with the pressure to travel further, the increased fuel costs this brings, and the need to rely on cheap, untrained foreign labour, ""you have a higher chance of meeting disaster"", she explained.

On 9 February this year, a large shipping trawler sank suddenly near the coastal city of Yeosu, killing 10 of the crew. It was a bitterly cold, windy day, and smaller boats had been banned from going out, but this trawler was deemed sturdy enough to withstand the gales. The reason it went down is still a mystery. One of those killed was 63-year-old Young-mook. A fisherman for 40 years, he had been planning to retire, but that morning someone called and asked him to fill a last-minute opening on the boat. ""It was so cold that once you fell in you wouldn't survive the hypothermia, especially at his age,"" said his daughter Ean, still distraught over his death. Ean thinks it has become too easy for boat owners to blame climate change for accidents. Even in cases where bad weather plays a role, she believes it is still the owners' responsibility to assess the risks and keep their crew safe. ""Ultimately it is their call when to go out,"" she said.

BBC/Hosu Lee Young-mook's daughter Ean (right) wants boat owners to make their vessels safer

As a child, she remembers her father's fridge would be filled with crabs and squid. ""Now the stocks are gone, but the companies still force them to go out, and because these men have worked as fishermen their whole lives, they don't have alternative job options, so they keep fishing even when they're too frail to do so,"" she said. Ean also wants owners to better maintain their boats, which are aging too. ""Companies have insurance, so they get compensated after a boat sinks, but our loved ones can't be replaced."" The authorities, aware they cannot control the weather, are now working with fishermen to make their boats safer. As we were with Mr Hong, whose boat capsized earlier this year, a team of government inspectors arrived to carry out a series of on-the-spot checks on two of his other vessels. The government's taskforce is recommending that boats be fitted with safety ladders, fisherman be required to wear life jackets, and that safety training be mandatory for all foreign crew. It also wants to improve search and rescue operations, and for fisherman to have access to more localised and real-time weather updates. Some regions are even offering to pay fishermen for the jellyfish they catch, to try to clean up the seas, while squid fishermen are being given loans to protect them from bankruptcy, and encourage them to retire.

Because the problem will likely worsen. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation forecasts that total fish catches in South Korea will decline by almost a third by the end of this century, if carbon emissions and global warming continue on their current trajectories. ""The future looks very bleak,"" said the anchovy fisherman Captain Park, now in his late 40s. He recently started a YouTube channel documenting his catches in the hope of earning some extra money. Park is the third generation of his family to do this work and likely the last. ""Back then it felt romantic getting up early and heading out to sea. There was a sense of adventure and reward.""

It's a job that can only be done under the cover of darkness. As night falls, the bat hunters make their way amongst the gravestones of Guestwick Church in Norfolk. The creaking door opens. Inside is the pitch black, deserted church and the team start to set up their specialist gear. Infrared and thermal cameras are carefully positioned, and audio detectors are set to bat friendly frequencies.

The bats soon begin to emerge, darting and swooping up and down the aisles, the amplified sounds of their bat chatter filling the historic building. ""Many of these churches have been on these sites for probably 1,000 years, and probably as long as they've been standing they've had bats in them,"" says Diana Spencer, from the Bats in Churches Project. A new study published in the British Ecological Society's journal People & Nature has found that these historic buildings are providing vital homes for the nocturnal animals. The research, based on citizen science surveys led by the Bat Conservation Trust, estimates that half of all churches in England - that's more than 8,000 - have bats in them. And that figure rises to about 80% for older churches. ""They're basically like a man-made forest,"" says Spencer. ""Full of little nooks and crannies where they can roost, big open flight spaces, dry spaces inside, away from the rain, where they can fly around. It is really just an absolutely perfect environment.""

Tony Jolliffe/BBC News Special cameras are needed to spot the nocturnal animals

Chris Damant/Bernwood Ecology Churches have plenty of spots where the Natterer's bat likes to roost

There are two types of bats at Guestwick: Common Pipistrelles and Natterer's. They roost high up in the rafters. The Pipistrelles emerge first, flying around for a few minutes, before squeezing out through minute gaps around the church door. The Natterer's come out a little later, preferring to exit through small holes in the roof to get outside and find food. Without the help of the specialist cameras, the bats are near impossible to spot, lost in the darkness. About a third of the churches surveyed in the study had no idea that bats were living there. But in others, their presence was much more noticeable. Bats can be messy houseguests. ""They're lovely, but they're problematic too,"" says Graeme Peart from St Margaret's Church, Saxlingham, just a few miles from Guestwick. He's responsible for the upkeep of the church - and says the bats started to become a nuisance about 15 years ago. ""There's the urine, the droppings,"" he says. ""One time there was a carpet leading up to the altar that became absolutely sodden with urine and droppings and had to be thrown away. They also destroyed the brass work.""

Bats in Churches Church users are finding ways to live alongside wildlife

Bats are legally protected in the UK, so it's generally not possible to remove them. But the church has worked with the Bats in Churches team to find a solution - they've built a sealed-off loft conversion above the vestry. Ecologist Phillip Parker sets up his ladder to show us inside. ""The idea is that the bats that are in the main body of the church will live in here, rather than in the church itself,"" he explains. It's kitted out with CCTV cameras, allowing the team to monitor the animal's behaviour. ""What we have found is certain weeks during the year there'll be a hundred bats in here, and then suddenly they will disappear,"" says Parker. ""We don't know where they go, but they disappear for about 10 days, and then they'll come back again. And without the CCTV, we never knew that.""

Bats in Churches The bat loft at St Margaret's sits above the vestry

A major construction project like this takes time, effort and money. The new loft, and the continued monitoring of the bats, has cost about £50,000, funded through the Heritage Lottery Fund and other partners. Diana Spencer says there are other less costly solutions and grants are on offer from the Bat Conservation Trust. ""On a simple level, you can use sheets or covers over areas where things might be damaged. You can put wax coating on things like brass so that the urine doesn't damage it."" She recommends that anyone who finds bats in a building should contact the National Bat Helpline for advice.

Tony Jolliffe/ BBC News From a very young age, Eileen Collins wanted to be an astronaut

She's the astronaut who smashed through the glass ceiling. And kept on going. Eileen Collins made history as the first woman to pilot and command a Nasa spacecraft - but despite her remarkable achievements, not everyone will know her name. Now a feature-length documentary called Spacewoman, which chronicles her trailblazing career, looks set to change that. We meet Collins at London's Science Museum. She's softly spoken, warm and very down to earth - but you quickly get a sense of her focus and determination. She clearly has inner steel. ""I was reading a magazine article on the Gemini astronauts. I was probably nine years old, and I thought that's the coolest thing. That's what I want to do,"" she says. ""Of course, there were no women astronauts back then. But I just thought, I'll be a lady astronaut.""

NASA Nasa's Space Shuttle programme flew for three decades

But that little girl set her sights even higher - she wanted to be at the controls of a spacecraft. And the only way to achieve this was to join the military and become a test pilot. In the Air Force, she stood out from the crowd and was selected to join the astronaut programme. She was to fly Space Shuttles - Nasa's reusable ""space planes"". She knew the eyes of the world were on her when her first mission launched in 1995. ""As the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle, I worked very hard at that because I didn't want people to say, 'Oh look, the woman has made a mistake'. Because it wasn't just about me, it was about the women to follow me,"" she says. ""And I wanted there to be a reputation for women pilots that was: 'Hey, they're really good'.""

Eileen Collins Eileen Collins with her young daughter Bridget

She was so good in fact that she was soon promoted to commander, in another first. Collins was also a parent to two young children. The fact that she was a working wife and mother was frequently brought up in press conferences at the time, with some journalists seemingly astonished that she could be both. But Collins says being a mum and a commander were ""the two best jobs in the world"". ""But I'm going to tell you it is harder to be a parent than to be a space shuttle commander,"" she laughs. ""The best training I ever had for being a commander was being a parent - because you have to learn how to say no to people.""

NASA A huge investigation was launched after the Columbia disaster

Nasa's Space Shuttles, which flew for three decades, reached breathtaking highs, but also some terrible lows. In 1986, the Challenger spacecraft suffered a catastrophic failure seconds after launching, killing all seven crew members on board. And in 2003, the Columbia shuttle broke up in the skies over Texas at the end of its mission, killing its crew of seven as well. A piece of insulating foam on Columbia's fuel tank broke loose during launch, damaging the heat shield with devastating results. Columbia was unable to withstand the fiery re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating as the world watched on in horror. Collins shakes her head at the memory of the disaster, and of the friends whose lives were lost. But with her job as commander, she had to pick up the mantle - she was to be in charge of the shuttle's following flight. Did she think about quitting at that point? ""People throughout the shuttle programme were counting on the commander to stick with it,"" she says quietly. ""I think quitting the mission would have been the opposite of brave… and I wanted to be a brave leader. I wanted to be a confident leader. I wanted to instill that confidence in other people.""

But when her mission finally took to the skies in 2005, the nightmare scenario happened again. A chunk of foam broke away during launch. This time, though, there was a plan in place to check the damage. But it meant undertaking one of the riskiest maneuvers in space history. Collins had to pilot the shuttle through a 360 degree flip while flying beneath the International Space Station. It allowed colleagues on the orbiting lab to photograph the craft's underside and check if the heatshield had been breached. ""There were engineers and managers saying it couldn't be done, all these reasons why it was too dangerous,"" she says. ""I listened to the discussion, they knew I was the commander, and I said: 'It sounds like we can do it'.""

NASA Collins remained cool and calm under pressure

With her hands steady at the controls, her voice calm as she spoke to mission control, Collins piloted the craft through a slow, graceful somersault. With the shuttle's underside now visible, the damage was quickly spotted - and a spacewalk was carried out to repair it. It meant Collins and her crew would make it safely home. This was Collins's last flight. She tells us that she always planned to stop after her fourth mission - to give others a chance to go to space. And she's watched plenty of astronauts follow in her footsteps. Does she have any advice for the next generation dreaming of the stars? ""Do your homework, listen to your teacher, pay attention in class and read books, and that will give you something to focus on,"" she says in a matter-of-fact way.

Those who follow Collins to space will learn just how much she achieved, not only as a woman, but as a formidable pilot and commander. She says she has no regrets about bringing her astronaut career to an end. She made her decision and didn't look back. But there's still a wistful look in her eye when we ask if she'd be tempted if a seat on a spacecraft became free. ""Yes, I would love to go on a mission someday. When I'm an old lady, maybe I'll get a chance to go back in space.""",2025-11-14T17:20:03.394465

Her eyes light up as she enthuses about the banksia species from her native Australia.

So they're not always pretty, but yet what comes out of them is so spectacular.""

We meet her at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) at Wakehurst botanic garden in Sussex. She lives locally and teamed up with the project as it celebrates its 25th anniversary. ""Really, I stumbled upon Wakehurst. I was just in awe of the landscape and I always feel regenerated by being in the natural world,"" she says. ""And then I discovered the seed bank, and I literally had my mind blown by the work that goes on here… and I thought, anything I can do to be connected to it - I found it so inspiring."" The MSB is home to more than 2.5 billion seeds collected from 40,000 wild plant species around the world. The seeds, which come in every shape, size and colour, are carefully processed, dried and then stored in freezers at a chilly -20C.

RBG Kew Cate Blanchett and a team from Kew met The King to talk about the seed bank

The conservation project was opened by The King - then the Prince of Wales - in 2000. He's taken part in a special episode of a Kew podcast about the project called Unearthed: The Need For Seeds with Cate Blanchett. In the recording he talks about his concerns that many plant species are being lost. ""I know how absolutely critical it all is, and the destruction of rainforests, the extinction of endless species, which have very likely remarkable properties,"" he tells the podcast. When the seed bank first opened, it was seen as a doomsday vault - a back-up store of seeds to safeguard wild plants from extinction. But 25 years on, the collection is being used for a different purpose: to restore environments that are under threat.

Tony Jolliffe/BBC News The MSB has more than 2.5bn seeds - including these blue Ravenala agathea seeds

""We want those seeds to be back out in the landscape,"" explained Dr Elinor Breman from the MSB, who's been showing Cate Blanchett the team's work. ""We're just providing a safe space for them until we can get them back out into a habitat where they can thrive and survive."" This includes projects like one taking place on the South Downs. A special mix of seeds from the MSB are being sown to help restore the rare chalk grasslands there. And this restoration work is being repeated around the world. ""We've been to every kind of habitat, from sea level to about 5,000m, and from pole to pole - literally,"" explained Dr Breman. ""And we're involved in restoring tropical forest, dry deciduous forest, grassland, steppe - you name it - we're trying to help people put those plants back in place.""

'Leopard-spot' rocks could be biggest clue yet

NASA/JPL The rocks are covered with unusual markings that look like leopard spots

Unusual rocks discovered on Mars contain the most tantalising evidence yet of potential past life on the Red Planet. The mudstones, found in a dusty riverbed by Nasa's Perseverance Rover, are dotted with intriguing markings nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds. Scientists believe these features contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient Martian microbes. It's possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but at a press conference Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found.

Watch: NASA finds ""clearest sign"" of ancient life on Mars

The findings are significant enough to meet Nasa's criteria for what it calls ""potential biosignatures"". This means that they warrant further investigation to determine whether they are biological in origin. ""We've not had something like this before, so I think that's the big deal,"" said Prof Sanjeev Gupta, a planetary scientist from Imperial College London and one of the authors of a study which has been published in the journal Nature. ""We have found features in the rocks that if you saw them on Earth could be explained by biology - by microbial process. So we're not saying that we found life, but we're saying that it really gives us something to chase."" ""It's like seeing a leftover fossil. Maybe it was a leftover meal, maybe that meal's been excreted and that's what we're seeing here,"" Dr Nicola Fox, Nasa's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, said in at the press conference.

The only way to fully confirm if the minerals were made by microbes would be to bring the rocks back to Earth for analysis . A Mars sample return mission has been proposed by Nasa and Esa but its future looks highly uncertain. The US Space Agency's science budget is facing huge cuts that have been put forward in President Trump's 2026 budget and a sample return mission is one of those facing cancellation.

Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life. The Perseverance Rover, which touched down on the Martian surface in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology. It has spent the last four years exploring a region called the Jezero Crater, which was once an ancient lake with a river flowing into it. The rover found the leopard print rocks last year at the bottom of a canyon carved out by the river in an area called the Bright Angel Formation. They are about 3.5bn years old and are a type of rock called mudstone, which is fine-grained rock formed from clays. ""We kind of immediately knew there was some interesting chemistry that had happened in these rocks so we were pretty excited right away,"" said Joel Hurowitz from Stony Brook University in New York, who is also a Perseverance mission scientist and lead author of the paper.

The rover used several instruments in its onboard lab to analyse the minerals in the rocks. This data was then beamed back to Earth for scientists to study. ""We think what we've found is evidence for a set of chemical reactions that took place in the mud that was deposited at the bottom of a lake - and those chemical reactions seem to have taken place between the mud itself and organic matter - and those two ingredients reacted to form new minerals,"" explained Dr Hurowitz. In similar conditions on Earth, chemical reactions creating minerals are typically driven by microbes. ""That is one of the possible explanations for how these features came to be in these rocks,"" said Dr Hurowitz. ""This feels like the most compelling potential biosignature detection that we've had to date."" Where we might find aliens in the next decade The scientists have also examined how the minerals could have formed without microbes - and concluded that natural geological processes could also be behind the chemical reactions. However they would require high temperatures, and the rocks don't look like they've been heated. ""We found some difficulties for the non-biological pathways - but we can't rule them out completely,"" Dr Hurowitz said.

It is 1am on 3 June. A near gale force wind is blasting into Scotland. Great weather for the Moray East and West offshore wind farms, you would have thought. The two farms are 13 miles off the north-east coast of Scotland and include some of the biggest wind turbines in the UK, at 257m high. With winds like that they should be operating at maximum capacity, generating what the developer, Ocean Winds, claims is enough power to meet the electricity needs of well over a million homes. Except they are not. That's because if you thought that once an electricity generator - whether it be a wind farm or a gas-powered plant - was connected to the national grid it could seamlessly send its electricity wherever it was needed in the country, you'd be wrong. The electricity grid was built to deliver power generated by coal and gas plants near the country's major cities and towns, and doesn't always have sufficient capacity in the wires that carry electricity around the country to get the new renewable electricity generated way out in the wild seas and rural areas. And this has major consequences.

Getty Images Ocean Winds was paid to turn down the output of its wind farms in the Moray Firth

The way the system currently works means a company like Ocean Winds gets what are effectively compensation payments if the system can't take the power its wind turbines are generating and it has to turn down its output. It means Ocean winds was paid £72,000 not to generate power from its wind farms in the Moray Firth during a half-hour period on 3 June because the system was overloaded - one of a number of occasions output was restricted that day. At the same time, 44 miles (70km) east of London, the Grain gas-fired power station on the Thames Estuary was paid £43,000 to provide more electricity. Payments like that happen virtually every day. Seagreen, Scotland's largest wind farm, was paid £65 million last year to restrict its output 71% of the time, according to analysis by Octopus Energy. Balancing the grid in this way has already cost the country more than £500 million this year alone, the company's analysis shows. The total could reach almost £8bn a year by 2030, warns the National Electricity System Operator (NESO), the body in charge of the electricity network. It's pushing up all our energy bills and calling into question the government's promise that net zero would end up delivering cheaper electricity. Now, the government is considering a radical solution: instead of one big, national electricity market, there'll be a number of smaller regional markets, with the government gambling that this could make the system more efficient and deliver cheaper bills. But in reality, it's not guaranteed that anyone will get cheaper bills. And even if some people do, many others elsewhere in the country could end up paying more.

The proposals have sparked such bitter debate that one senior energy industry executive called it ""the most vicious policy fight"" he has ever known. He has, he says, ""lost friends"" over it. Meanwhile, political opponents who claim net zero is an expensive dead end are only too ready to pounce. It is reported that the Prime Minister has asked to review the details of what some newspapers are calling a ""postcode pricing"" plan. So is the government really ready to risk the most radical shake-up of the UK electricity market since privatisation 35 years ago? And what will it really mean for our bills?

Net zero under attack

The Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, is certainly in a fix. His net zero policy is under attack like never before. The Tories have come out against it, green politicians say it isn't delivering for ordinary people, and even Tony Blair has weighed in against it. Meanwhile Reform UK has identified the policy as a major Achilles heel for the Labour government. ""The next election will be fought on two issues, immigration and net stupid zero,"" says Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice. ""And we are going to win."" Poll after poll says cost of living is a much more important for most people, and people often specifically cite concerns about rising energy prices.

Getty Images Ed Miliband's net zero policy is under attack like never before

Miliband sold his aggressive clean energy policies in part on cutting costs. He said that ensuring 95% of the country's electricity comes from low-carbon sources by 2030 would slash the average electricity bill by £300. But the potential for renewables to deliver lower costs just isn't coming through to consumers. Renewables now generate more than half the country's electricity, but because of the limits to how much electricity can be moved around the system, even on windy days some gas generation is almost always needed to top the system up. And because gas tends to be more expensive, it frequently sets the wholesale price.

Could 'zonal' pricing lower bills?

Supporters of the government's plan argue that, as long as prices continue to be set at a national level, the hold gas has on the cost of electricity will be hard to break. Less so with regional – or, in the jargon, ""zonal"" - pricing. Think of Scotland, blessed with vast wind resources but just 5.5 million people. The argument goes that if prices were set locally, it wouldn't be necessary to pay wind farms to be turned down because there wasn't enough capacity in the cables to carry all the electricity into England. On a windy day like 3 June, they would have to sell that spare power to local people instead of into a national market. The theory is prices would fall dramatically – on some days Scottish customers might even get their electricity for free.

The grid was built to deliver power generated by coal and gas plants near the country's major cities and towns

Other areas with lots of renewable power - such as Yorkshire and the North East, as well as parts of Wales - would stand to benefit too. And, as solar investment increases in Lincolnshire and other parts of the east of England, they could also see prices tumble. All that cheap power could also transform the economics of industry. Supporters argue that it would attract energy-intensive businesses such as data centres, chemical companies and other manufacturing industries. In London and much of the south of England, the price of electricity would sometimes be higher than in the windy north. But supporters say some of the hundreds of millions of pounds the system would save could be used to make sure no one pays more than they do now. And those higher prices could also encourage investors to build new wind farms and solar plants closer to where the demand is. The argument is that would lower prices in the long run and bring another benefit - less electricity would need to be carried around the country, so we would need fewer new pylons, saving everyone money and meaning less clutter in the countryside.

Getty Images Reform UK chairman Richard Tice, seen here with party leader Nigel Farage, says the next general election will be fought on immigration and ""net stupid zero""

""Zonal pricing would make the energy system as a whole dramatically more efficient, slashing this waste and cutting bills for every family and business in the country,"" argues Greg Jackson, the CEO of Octopus Energy, one of the biggest energy suppliers in the UK. Research commissioned by the company estimates the savings could top £55 billion by 2050 - which it claims could knock £50 to £100 a year off the average bill. Octopus points out Sweden made the switch to regional pricing in just 18 months. The supporters of regional pricing include NESO, Citizens Advice and the head of the energy regulator, Ofgem. Last week a committee of the House of Lords recommended the country should switch to the system.

Energy firms push back

There are, however, many businesses involved in building and running renewable energy plants that oppose the move. ""We're making billions of pounds of investments in renewable power in the UK every year,"" says Tom Glover, the UK chair of the giant German power company RWE. ""I can't go to my board and say let's take a bet on billions of pounds of investment."" He's worried changing the way energy is priced could undermine contracts and make revenues more uncertain. And he says it risks undermining the government's big push to switch to green energy.

AFP via Getty Images Seagreen, Scotland's largest wind farm, was paid £65 million last year to restrict its output 71% of the time, according to Octopus Energy

The main cost of wind and solar plants is in the build. It means the price of the energy they produce is very closely tied to the cost of building and, because developers borrow most of the money, that means the interest rates they are charged. And we are talking a lot of money. The government is expecting power companies to spend £40bn pounds a year over the next five years on renewable projects in the UK. Glover says even a very small change in interest rates could have dramatic effects on how much renewable infrastructure is built and how much the power from it costs. ""Those additional costs could quickly overwhelm any of the benefits of regional pricing,"" says Stephen Woodhouse, an economist with the consultancy firm AFRY, which has studied the impact of regional pricing for the power companies. That would come as already high interest rates have combined with rising prices for steel and other materials to push up the cost of renewables. Plans for a huge wind farm off the coast of Yorkshire were cancelled last month because the developer said it no longer made economic sense.

And there's another consideration, he says. The National Grid, which owns the pylons, substations and cables that move electricity around the country, is already rolling out a huge investment programme – some £60bn over the next five years - to upgrade the system ready for the new world of clean power. That new infrastructure will mean more capacity to bring electricity from our windy northern coasts down south, and therefore also mean fewer savings from a regional pricing system in the future. There are other arguments too. Critics warn introducing regional pricing could take years, that energy-intensive businesses like British Steel can't just up sticks and move, and that the system will be unfair because some customers will pay more than others. But according to Greg Jackson of Octopus, the power companies and their backers just want to protect their profits. ""Unsurprisingly, it's the companies that enjoy attractive returns from this absurd system who are lobbying hard to maintain the status quo,"" he says.

Yet the power companies say Octopus has a vested interest too. It is the UK's biggest energy supplier with some seven million customers, and owns a sophisticated billing system it licenses to other suppliers, so could gain from changes to the way electricity is priced, they claim. And the clock is ticking. Whether the government meets its clean power targets will depend on how many new wind farms and solar plants are built. The companies who will build them say they need certainty around the future of the electricity market, so a decision must be taken soon. It's expected in the next couple of weeks. Over to you, Mr Miliband.

Mr Gladwin, who lives in Croydon with his five children, acted immediately. He put down peppermint oil and rat poison and so far they haven't returned. But the experience shook him. ""I was worried for the children's health, I didn't want them catching anything."" There was another feeling too: shame. ""It's not nice to say we're infested, that our family is living in a rat-infested property."" Cleankill, the pest control company tasked with tackling the infestation on Mr Gladwin's estate, works across the south of England. Its founder, Clive Bury says he has seen a ""remarkable"" increase in call outs for rat activity, estimating a 20% increase in the last two years. Similar patterns are being reported across the country. Trade body the British Pest Control Association (BPCA) says more than half of the pest control companies who are members have seen an increased number of rat callouts over the last five years. Rats live in drains, sewers and burrows, and emerge mostly at night, so counting them is nearly impossible and estimates on rat population figures vary. In the UK it could be anywhere from 10 million to 120 million. What is known is that more than half a million rodent infestations were reported to UK councils, between 2023 and the middle of this year, according to Freedom of Information requests gathered by repair company, Drain Detectives.

But it's not just affecting the UK. Rat numbers are reported to have spiked in several US cities too, including Washington DC, San Francisco and New York City, as well as in Amsterdam and Toronto. Though they're not inherently dirty animals, rats scavenge in sewers and bins and can pass on serious diseases to humans. Leptospirosis (Weil's disease) is transmitted through their urine, and hantavirus can be spread by breathing in infected droppings. They can also eat their way through farm produce and contaminate food supplies. So, given rats have shown themselves to be wily in avoiding being caught - what would it really take to stop them? Or are we too far gone to prevent rats from overrunning our cities?

Rising temperatures, rising rat activity

Bobby Corrigan calls himself an urban rodentologist. He started out as an exterminator in New York City and has spent his life immersed in rats. ""I ended up in sewers, trying to hang poison baits to kill rats."" Years later, while studying rats in college, he went to extreme lengths to understand their behaviours - once he slept on the floor of a rat-infested barn to observe it first hand. What astonished him was their complex social structure, and evidence of what he believed to be signs of altruism. ""I saw young rats carrying food and giving it to older rats that couldn't get around,"" he remembers. He was also determined to understand the reasons for the rise.

The number of rats at this block of flats in Croydon is on the rise

There are many possible reasons for this. Niall Gallagher, technical manager at the BPCA, says our growing appetite for fast food, the fact some councils collect rubbish less frequently, as well as road and building works disturbing the sewer network, all contribute. But there is evidence that rising temperatures might also be at play. Scientific evidence has found that rat populations are sensitive to temperature but Dr Corrigan, who previously worked at the New York City Department of Health as a research scientist, together with researchers from the University of Richmond, Virginia, set out to find out whether the rise in rat activity correlated to temperature increases. Their study examined 16 cities, mostly in North America, and the results, published in the journal Science Advances earlier this year, found that 11 of them recorded significant increases in rat activity over a period of between seven and 17 years.

Bobby Corrigan Dr Bobby Corrigan once slept on the floor of a rat-infested barn to observe their behaviour patterns firsthand

In Washington DC the increase was almost 400%, in San Francisco it was 300%, Toronto 180% and New York 160%. Only three cities saw declines, including Tokyo and New Orleans. ""Cities experiencing greater temperature increases over time saw larger increases in rats,"" the study found. Those increases approached 2C in some places during the study period. Dr Corrigan believes that - as long as temperatures continue to rise, and in particular winters become warmer - the increase in rat numbers is likely to continue. And global temperatures are indeed set to rise between at least 1.9C and 2.7C above the pre-industrial average by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of independent climate researchers.

Phenomenal breeders - until it's cold

Rats are phenomenal breeders. A female typically has around six litters a year, each with up to 12 pups. Those rats can start breeding after nine weeks, meaning two rats can potentially create more than 1,000 offspring in a single year.

Universal Images Group via Getty Images Rats don't hibernate, so when exposed to the cold, it can kill them or result in them producing fewer pups, as baby rats are known – which slows population growth

Researchers say numbers are particularly prone to increase in cities. That's because their heat-trapping tarmac and buildings tend to warm more quickly than rural areas. And the trend of people moving from rural areas to cities is playing a part too, according to Dr Corrigan. ""Land is disappearing like crazy, and we're putting up buildings so we reduce their [rats] habitat in the wild,"" he says. Extra buildings means more nooks, pipes and drains for rats to live in. Which all adds to the challenge of how to best control growing populations.

A surprising superpower

One of the curious facts about rats - and one begins to explain why poison baits often don't work - is that they cannot vomit. In theory this means that once rat poison is ingested, they can't get rid of it. But rats are also ""neophobic"" or fearful of new things, according to Professor Steven Belmain, a professor of ecology at the University of Greenwich. He believes the two points are related. It is something of a ""superpower"", he says, as when they come across a potential food they don't just dive in. ""They will only try a little bit. So once they understand that they don't feel ill, they'll realise, 'okay, I can eat that'. ""You could argue that this cautious approach to life has stood them well.""

Getty Images One expert says the solution comes down to focusing on our cities, not rat traps and poison baits

Dr Alan Buckle of the University of Reading has spent 30 years working to develop new rat poisons but - he tells me with a laugh - ""I failed"". If a poison tastes bad or causes any discomfort or pain to a rat, they will not eat more. Which is why slower-acting substances, mainly anticoagulants - drugs that stop blood forming into clots - are used. These take up to a week to act, giving enough time for rats to eat a lethal dose. But they are recognised as a cruel way to die, killing the rats by causing internal bleeding. What's more, in recent years rats have developed genetic mutations that give them some immunity to these powerful drugs too. Some researchers are looking at the possibility of using oral contraceptives as an alternative, more humane way to prevent rat numbers growing further.

On patrol with the Rat Tsar

Few know this challenge better than Kathleen Corradi, a former schoolteacher who was appointed the city's Rat Tsar by the New York Mayor in 2023. An estimated three million rats live in the five boroughs and Corradi was reportedly awarded $3.5m (£2.6m) to increase public awareness about rat mitigation. She started what she calls a ""rat academy"" that teaches people how to stop their neighbourhood from being overrun by rats.

New York City Hall Kathleen Corradi was appointed New York's ""Rat Tsar"" to tackle the city's rat problem

""They take a rat walk with me, where we go out into neighbourhoods, and we talk about human behaviour and we talk about rat behaviour,"" she told the BBC earlier this month. ""We talk about how it all comes together and what they could be doing in their neighbourhoods."" Her team also urged New York residents to phone in if they see rats or evidence of behaviours likely to encourage rats. Inspectors investigate the reports and order action, with stiff fines if it isn't taken. And there was another crucial change – instead of putting their rubbish out on the street in plastic bags, now most New Yorkers are obliged to put their waste in rat-proof bins.

Corradi is now leaving the role, but she says the approach is showing some progress. Ultimately, she explained, ""cutting off rats' food source is the key to a sustained reduction"".

Overflowing bins and fast food

Back in Croydon, Alex Donnovan, a pest controller for Cleankill, leads me into the backyard of the estate where John Gladwin lives. It is just after dawn, and he gestures for me to stay still and keep quiet. Moments later, there is a rustling and a rat darts from beneath the concrete walkway towards the communal bins. Next, the head of a large rat emerges from a burrow at the end of the garden. During the two hours we spent on the estate, some rats climbed high into a tree, while a particularly brazen one jumped into a bin and pulled a hunk of food from a plastic bag while I watched on, less than a metre away. Mr Donnovan believes it is almost impossible to get control of an infestation of this scale. ""There's just so much food."" He gestures to bins overflowing with rubbish bags. ""Even if we put down rodenticide, they won't eat it. They are just not interested… Once these bins are infested with rats, the bin men don't want to collect it either.""

John Gladwin, who lives on the estate, says finding rats in his flat made him concerned for his children's health - it also made him feel ashamed

Warmer temperatures may well help fuel growing rat populations but our overflowing bins, fondness for fast food and fractured communities all add to the challenge of keeping it under control. In the UK there are more people than ever are living in closer proximity. The Office for National Statistics projects the population will increase from 67.6 million in 2022 to 72.5 million by 2032, with the proportion living in urban areas growing too. So, instead of hoping poison will do the trick, the solution could come down to something far more straightforward.

AFP via Getty Images Rats are thriving in cities, fuelled by overflowing bins, fast food and dense urban living

""If we take care of our city environment, then we won't have to worry about being so inhumane to them,"" argues Dr Corrigan. ""By not giving [rats access to] the food and scraps, then we don't have to poison them and kill them and torture them and all the crazy things we do to them."" The challenge now is how to do that, and at speed. After all, as he puts it, we have already ""underestimated them"". ""We ignored rats and let them get out of hand… and now we are paying the price."" Additional reporting: Florence Freeman

BBC

In a small village in Switzerland's beautiful Loetschental valley, Matthias Bellwald walks down the main street and is greeted every few steps by locals who smile or offer a handshake or friendly word. Mr Bellwald is a mayor, but this isn't his village. Two months ago his home, three miles away in Blatten, was wiped off the map when part of the mountain and glacier collapsed into the valley. The village's 300 residents had been evacuated days earlier, after geologists warned that the mountain was increasingly unstable. But they lost their homes, their church, their hotels and their farms. Lukas Kalbermatten also lost the hotel that had been in his family for three generations.""The feeling of the village, all the small alleys through the houses, the church, the memories you had when you played there as a child… all this is gone.""

Hotel Edelweiss Blatten's residents were evacuated days before the disaster

Today, he is living in borrowed accommodation in the village of Wiler. Mr Bellwald has a temporary office there too, where he is supervising the massive clean-up operation - and the rebuild. The good news is, he believes the site can be cleared by 2028, with the first new houses ready by 2029. But it comes with a hefty pricetag. Rebuilding Blatten is estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps as much as $1 million (USD) per resident. Voluntary contributions from the public quickly raised millions of Swiss francs to help those who had lost their homes. The federal government and the canton promised financial support too. But some in Switzerland are asking: is it worth it?

Shutterstock Houses were destroyed after a large part of Blatten was buried under masses of ice, mud, and rock

Though the disaster shocked Switzerland, some two thirds of the country is mountainous, and climate scientists warn that the glaciers and the permafrost – the glue that holds the mountains together – are thawing as the global temperature increases, making landslides more likely. Protecting areas will be costly. Switzerland spends almost $500m a year on protective structures, but a report carried out in 2007 for the Swiss parliament suggested real protection against natural hazards could cost six times that. Is that a worthwhile investment? Or should the country - and residents - really consider the painful option of abandoning some of their villages?

The day the earth shook

The Alps are an integral part of Swiss identity. Each valley, like the Loetschental, has its own culture. Mr Kalbermatten used to take pride in showing hotel guests the ancient wooden houses in Blatten. Sometimes he taught them a few words of Leetschär, the local dialect. Losing Blatten, and the prospect of losing others like it, has made many Swiss ask themselves how many of those alpine traditions could disappear.

Angus MacKenzie 'I'll never forget it. The earth shook.' Fernando Lehner recalls the day of the landslide

Today, Blatten lies under millions of cubic metres of rock, mud, and ice. Above it, the mountain remains unstable. When they were first evacuated, Blatten's residents, knowing their houses had stood there for centuries, believed it was a purely precautionary measure. They would be home again soon, they thought. Fernando Lehner, a retired businessman, says no one expected the scale of the disaster. ""We knew there would be a landslide that day… But it was just unbelievable. I would never have imagined that it would come down so quickly. ""And that explosion, when the glacier and landslide came down into the valley, I'll never forget it. The earth shook.""

Landslides are 'more unpredictable'

The people of Blatten, keen to get their homes back as soon as possible, don't want to talk about climate change. They point out that the Alps are always dangerous, and describe the disaster as a once in a millennium event. But climate scientists say global warming is making alpine life more risky. Matthias Huss, a glaciologist with Zurich's Federal Institute of Technology, as well as glacier monitoring group Glamos, argues that climate change was a factor in the Blatten disaster. ""The thawing of permafrost at very high elevation led to the collapse of the summit,"" he explains.

Matthias Huss Glaciologist Matthias Huss argues that climate change was a factor in the Blatten disaster

""This mountain summit crashed down onto the glacier… and also the glacier retreat led to the fact that the glacier stabilised the mountain less efficiently than before. So climate change was involved at every angle."" Geological changes unrelated to climate change also played a role, he concedes - but he points out that glaciers and permafrost are key stabilising factors across the alps. His team at Glamos has monitored a record shrinkage of the glaciers over the past few years. And average alpine temperatures are increasing. In the days before the mountain crashed down, Switzerland's zero-degree threshold – the altitude at which the temperature reaches freezing point – rose above 5,000 metres, higher than any mountain in the country. ""It is not the very first time that we're seeing big landslides in the Alps,"" says Mr Huss. ""I think what should be worrying us is that these events are becoming more frequent, but also more unpredictable.""

Angus MacKenzie Blatten's residents lost their homes, church and farms: living below a mountain, as many Swiss do, looks increasingly precarious

A study from November 2024 by the Swiss Federal Research Institute, which reviewed three decades of literature, concurred that climate change was ""rapidly altering high mountain environments, including changing the frequency, dynamic behavior, location, and magnitude of alpine mass movements"", although quantifying the exact impact of climate change was ""difficult"".

More villages, more evacuations

Graubünden is the largest holiday region in Switzerland, and is popular with skiers and hikers for its untouched nature, alpine views and pretty villages. The Winter Olympics was hosted here twice - in the upmarket resort of St Moritz - while the town of Davos hosts world leaders for the World Economic Forum each year. One village in Graubünden has a different story to tell. Brienz was evacuated more than two years ago because of signs of dangerous instability in the mountain above. Its residents have still not been able to return, and in July heavy rain across Switzerland led geologists to warn a landslide appeared imminent.

Angus MacKenzie Average alpine temperatures are increasing, say scientists. Meanwhile glaciers are shrinking

Elsewhere in Switzerland, above the resort of Kandersteg, in the Bernese Oberland region, a rockface has become unstable, threatening the village. Now residents have an evacuation plan. There too, heavy rain this summer raised the alarm, and some hiking trails up to Oeschinen Lake, a popular tourist attraction, were closed. Some disasters have claimed lives. In 2017, a massive rockslide came down close to the village of Bondo, killing eight hikers. Bondo has since been rebuilt, and refortified, at a cost of $64 million. As far back as 2003, the village of Pontresina spent millions on a protective dam to shore up the thawing permafrost in the mountain above. Not every alpine village is at risk, but the apparent unpredictability is causing huge concern.

The debate around relocation

Blatten, like all Swiss mountain villages, was risk mapped and monitored; that's why its 300 residents were evacuated. Now, questions are being asked about the future of other villages too. In the aftermath of the disaster, there was a huge outpouring of sympathy. But the possible price tag of rebuilding it also came with doubts. An editorial in the influential Neue Zürcher Zeitung questioned Switzerland's traditional - and constitutional - wealth distribution model, which takes tax revenue from urban centres like Zurich to support remote mountain communities. The article described Swiss politicians as being ""caught in an empathy trap"", adding that ""because such incidents are becoming more frequent due to climate change, they are shaking people's willingness to pay for the myth of the Alps, which shapes the nation's identity."" It suggested people living in risky areas of the Alps should consider relocation.

Preserving the alpine villages is expensive. And Neue Zürcher Zeitung was not the first to question the cost of saving every alpine community, but its tone angered some. While three quarters of Swiss live in urban areas, many have strong family connections to the mountains. Switzerland may be a wealthy, highly developed, high-tech country now, but its history is rural, marked by poverty and harsh living conditions. Famine in the 19th century caused waves of emigration. Mr Kalbermatten explains that the word ""heimat"" is hugely important in Switzerland. ""Heimat is when you close your eyes and you think about what you did as a child, the place you lived as a child. ""It's a much bigger word than home."" Ask a Swiss person living for decades in Zurich or Geneva, or even New York, where their heimat is, and for many, the answer will be the village they were born in. For Mr Kalbermatten and his sister and brothers, who live in cities, heimat is the valley where people speak Leetschär, the dialect they all still dream in.

Imogen Foulkes Traditional wooden masks called Tschäggättä are unique to that valley

The fear is that if these valleys become depopulated, other aspects of unique mountain culture could be lost too - like the Tschäggättä, traditional wooden masks, unique to the Loetschental valley. Their origins are mysterious, possibly pagan. Every February, local young men wear them, along with animal skins, and run through the streets. Mr Kalbermatten points to the example of some areas of northern Italy where this loss of culture has happened. ""[Now] there are only abandoned villages, empty houses, and wolves. ""Do we want that?""

Angus MacKenzie Lukas Kalbermatten believes the site can be cleared by 2028, with Blatten's first new houses ready by 2029.

For many, the answer is no: An opinion poll from research institute, Sotomo, asked 2,790 people what they most cherished about their country. The most common answer? Our beautiful alpine landscape, and our stability. But the poll did not ask what price they were prepared to pay.

Trying to tame a mountain

Boris Previsic, the director of the University of Lucerne's Institute for the Culture of the Alps, says that many Swiss, at least in the cities, had begun to believe they had tamed the alpine environment. Switzerland's railways, tunnels, cable cars and high alpine passes are masterpieces of engineering, connecting alpine communities. But now, in part because of climate change, he suggests, that confidence is gone. ""The human induced geology is too strong compared to human beings,"" he argues. ""In Switzerland, we thought we could do everything with infrastructure. Now I think we are at ground zero concerning infrastructure.""

Boris Previsic Boris Previsic says that many Swiss, at least in the cities, had begun to believe they had tamed the alpine environment

The village of Blatten had stood for centuries. ""When you are in a village which has existed already for 800 years, you should feel safe. That is what is so shocking."" In his view, it is time to fight against these villages dying out. ""To fight means we have to be more prepared,"" he explains. ""But we have to be more flexible. We have always also to consider evacuation."" At the end of the day, he adds, ""you cannot hold back the whole mountain"". In the village of Wiler, Mr Previsic's point is greeted with a weary smile. ""The mountain always decides,"" agrees Mr Bellwald. ""We know that they are dangerous. We love the mountains, we don't hate them because of that. Our grandfathers lived with them. Our fathers lived with them. And our children will also live with them.""

Angus MacKenzie Helicopters carry debris from the disaster site at Blatten. Even the military is involved in the operation.

At lunchtime in the local restaurant in Wiler, the tables are filled with clean-up teams, engineers and helicopter crew. The Blatten recovery operation is in full swing. At one table, a man from one of Switzerland's biggest insurance companies sits alone. Every half hour, he is joined by someone, an elderly couple, a middle aged man, a young woman. He buys each a drink, and carefully notes down the details of their lost homes. Outside, along the valley's winding roads, lorries and bulldozers trundle up to the disaster site. Overhead, helicopters carry large chunks of debris. Even the military is involved. Sebastian Neuhaus commands the Swiss army's disaster relief readiness battalion, and says they must press on despite the scale of the task. ""We have to,"" he says. ""There are 300 life histories buried down there."" The abiding feeling is one of stubborn determination to carry on. ""If we see someone from Blatten, we hug each other,"" says Mr Kalbermatten. ""Sometimes we say, 'it's nice, you're still here.' And that's the most important thing, we are all still here."" Lead image: The village of Blatten after the disaster.

The New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That’s up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv.

With $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy.

“The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings — consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release.

Net interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices.

Deposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven.

A key point of conversation after last month’s turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars.

“Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,” Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is “confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.”

So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022.

That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches.

Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.

Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.

If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.

Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return.

Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so.

Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:

Interest on your savings

Investment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains)

Pay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle

Unemployment income

Social Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account

Tips

Gambling winnings

Income from a rental property you own

Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).

If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically.

Here are some of the tax forms you may have received:

W-2 from your wage or salaried jobs

from your wage or salaried jobs 1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments

for capital gains and losses on your investments 1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments

from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments 1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution

for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution 1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor

from your clients, if you worked as a contractor 1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022.

for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022. 1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract

for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received.

“Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society.

One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.

Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer.

Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.

What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.

Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18.

So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.

You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.

Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions.

If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option.

You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.

If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.

Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears.

Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.

Investors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts.

That led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February.

However, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year.

The effect of smaller tax returns

Smaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say.

“March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN.

Credit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth.

Enhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report.

A slowing labor market

Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month.

Still, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute.

“The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said.

Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported.

The job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

For consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then.

The latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April.

“On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release.

“Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.

This is it.

The media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days.

Jury selection in Dominion Voting Systems’ monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court. Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as scheduled on Monday.

It is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case.

A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.

It’s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way.

I’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes.

The network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before.

But this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument.

Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air.

In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice.

Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.",2025-11-14T17:20:34.374536

When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds.

As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited.

SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color.

Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.”

Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States.

Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital.

SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors.

“When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors.

Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding.

Many women and people of color say they are turned away

Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans.

In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows.

“We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN.

Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said.

Immigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them.

“The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said.

Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank.

In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her.

“The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said.

None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.

Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country.

Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities.

The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks.

Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks.

OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets.

SVB’s collapse could spark future change, entrepreneur says

Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders.

“I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN.

Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase.

But Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’”",2025-11-14T17:20:37.726747

Lake Powell, the second-largest human-made reservoir in the US, has lost nearly 7% of its potential storage capacity since 1963, when Glen Canyon Dam was built, a new report shows.

In addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought, the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018.

That’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times.

The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers, according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold.

As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation.

It’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months.

Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January.

And last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity.

The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated.

The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities.

“It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.”",2025-11-14T17:20:40.010592

Air pollution spiked to unhealthy levels around the world in 2021, according to a new report.

The report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health.

Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times.

The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times.

In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021.

“This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.”

IQAir

Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir.

It’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter.

PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.

Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths.

IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories.

In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed.

“The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote.

Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities.

“We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.”

Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July.

China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city.

The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change.

“This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said.

The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions.

“When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said.

Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh.

Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports.

“I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.”

The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health.

Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel.

“We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy.

So why aren’t more of them doing it?,"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 07:01:50 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_world.rss,"CNN —

As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls.

The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.

At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.)

As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations.

Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.

Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.

The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said.

“Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.”

Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities.

Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN.

CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?

Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption.

The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.

“We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.”

What’s the holdup?

Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.

It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.

Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.

Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.

“Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.”

According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs.

Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said.

Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.

Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.

“My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.”

Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said.

Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said.

“We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN.

CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.

Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.

“For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.”

Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said.

“Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load.

“We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.”

Acting on climate, equitably

For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.

Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN.

The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.

In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.

“One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.”

Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.”

Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.

Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.

“The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.”",2025-11-14T17:20:44.734727

CNN —

Bringing the second day of this year’s Coachella to a close, K-Pop girl group Blackpink made history Saturday night when they became the first Asian act to ever headline the festival. To a crowd of, reportedly, over 125,000 people, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé used the ground-breaking moment to pay homage to Korean heritage by arriving onstage in hanboks: a traditional type of dress.

While the garments were shrugged off a few seconds into their opening track, “Pink Venom,” revealing each member’s custom black and pink Dolce and Gabbana outfit, fans across the world had already received the message. Screenshots of the moment quickly spread among Blackpink superfans, otherwise known as Blinks. “The way they stepped onto the biggest western stage in hanboks … literally proved their place at the top of the industry,” tweeted one Blink. “Blackpink really are in a league of their own.”

Another called the group “Korea’s cultural delegation” on Instagram, in reference to not only the hanboks but other visual cues incorporated into their show, such as one of the stage backdrops featuring an angular tiled roof reminiscent of traditional Korean architecture.

In recent years, Blackpink have enjoyed a meteoric rise to global fame. According to Guinness World Records, they are currently the most streamed female group on Spotify, and have the most-viewed music YouTube channel. Last year, they were the first female K-Pop group to reach number 1 in the UK and US album charts, and in 2020 their track “How You Like That” became the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours. (The group also wore modernized hanboks, designed by Kim Danha, in one of the music video’s scenes.) Their landmark set over the weekend was in fact a follow-up to another milestone: In 2019, they became the first female K-Pop group to ever play at Coachella or any other US festival.

From the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra worn by Madonna for her 1990 Blond Ambition tour to Geri “Ginger Spice” Halliwell’s Union Jack mini dress, the right stage costume can live on forever in public memory. Particularly when worn at a career-defining moment. During another watershed Coachella performance — Beyonce’s 2018 headline set — the singer’s custom Balmain collegiate-style yellow hoodie was a joyful nod to Black culture, specifically historically Black colleagues and universities.

The group’s four black hanboks were custom created by South Korean pattern design brand OUWR and traditional Korean dressmakers Kumdanje. Inspired by the Cheol-lik silhouette, each garment was hand-embroidered with metallic traditional Korean motifs, including dan-cheong patterns and peonies (a symbol of royalty in Korea). “It was our pleasure and such an honor to be able to show the beautiful values of Korea and Hanbok together,” the designers wrote in a combined Instagram post. “Blackpink showed the beauty of Korea and dazzled the world.”

In Korea, hanboks are still worn for special occasions and often seen on TV dramas. Many designers in the country have also created contemporary takes that are incorporated into everyday wear. At Seoul Fashion Week, JULYCOLUMN’s Fall-Winter 2023 collection drew on the hanbok’s voluminous silhouette to create shirts and structured jackets. Last September, Korean label BlueTamburin brought the garment to a Western audience by exclusively using traditional hanbok fabric to create its Spring-Summer 2023 collection at Milan Fashion Week.

Whether you’re a devoted Blink or not, the looks marked a moment of Asian visibility, recognition of traditional craftsmanship and a powerful example of feeling seen through fashion — representing Korean culture and symbolically embracing both its past and future.

At the end of their performance, and having addressed the audience between numbers in English throughout their two-hour-long performance, Blackpink finished their set in Korean: “Until now, it has been Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Rosé Blackpink. Thank you.”

CNN —

“Old Masters” such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Rembrandt may have used proteins, especially egg yolk, in their oil paintings, according to a new study.

Trace quantities of protein residue have long been detected in classic oil paintings, though they were often ascribed to contamination. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found the inclusion was likely intentional — and sheds light on the technical knowledge of the Old Masters, the most skilled European painters of the 16th, 17th, or early 18th century, and the way they prepared their paints.

“There are very few written sources about this and no scientific work has been done before to investigate the subject in such depth,” said study author Ophélie Ranquet of the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering and Mechanics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, in a phone interview. “Our results show that even with a very small amount of egg yolk, you can achieve an amazing change of properties in the oil paint, demonstrating how it might have been beneficial for the artists.”

Simply adding some egg yolk to their works, it turns out, could have long-lasting effects that went beyond just aesthetics.

Eggs vs. oil

Compared with the medium formulated by ancient Egyptians called tempera — which combines egg yolk with powdered pigments and water — oil paint creates more intense colors, allows for very smooth color transitions and dries far less quickly, so it can be used for several days after its preparation. However, oil paint, which uses linseed or safflower oil instead of water, also has drawbacks, including being more susceptible to color darkening and damage caused by exposure to light.

Because making paint was an artisanal and experimental process, it is possible that the Old Masters might have added egg yolk, a familiar ingredient, to the newer type of paint, which first showed up in the seventh century in Central Asia before spreading to Northern Europe in the Middle Ages and Italy during the Renaissance. In the study, the researchers recreated the process of paint-making by using four ingredients — egg yolk, distilled water, linseed oil and pigment — to mix two historically popular and significant colors, lead white and ultramarine blue.

“The addition of egg yolk is beneficial because it can tune the properties of these paints in a drastic way,” Ranquet said, “For example by showing aging differently: It takes a longer time for the paint to oxidize, because of the antioxidants contained in the yolk.”

The chemical reactions between the oil, the pigment and the proteins in the yolk directly affect the paint’s behavior and viscosity. “For example, the lead white pigment is quite sensitive to humidity, but if you coat it with a protein layer, it makes it a lot more resistant to it, making the paint quite easy to apply,” Ranquet said.

“On the other hand, if you wanted something stiffer without having to add a lot of pigment, with a bit of egg yolk you can create a high impasto paint,” she added, referring to a painting technique where the paint is laid out in a stroke thick enough that the brushstrokes are still visible. Using less pigment would have been desirable centuries ago, when certain pigments — such as lapis lazuli, which was used to make ultramarine blue — were more expensive than gold, according to Ranquet.

A direct evidence of the effect of egg yolk in oil paint, or lack thereof, can be seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna of the Carnation,” one of the paintings observed during the study. Currently on display at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany, the work shows evident wrinkling on the face of Mary and the child.

“Oil paint starts to dry from the surface down, which is why it wrinkles,” Ranquet said.

One reason for wrinkling may be an insufficient quantity of pigments in the paint, and the study has shown that this effect could be avoided with the addition of egg yolk: “That’s quite amazing because you have the same quantity of pigment in your paint, but the presence of the egg yolk changes everything.”

Because wrinkling occurs within days, it’s likely that Leonardo and other Old Masters might have caught onto this particular effect, as well as additional beneficial properties of egg yolk in oil paint, including resistance to humidity. The “Madonna of Carnation” is one of Leonardo’s earliest paintings, created at a time when he might have been still trying to master the then newly popular medium of oil paint.

New understanding of the classics

Another painting observed during the study was “The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ,” by Botticelli, also on display at the Alte Pinakothek. The work is mostly made with tempera, but oil paint has been used for the background and some secondary elements.

“We knew that some parts of the paintings show brushstrokes that are typical for what we call an oil painting, and yet we detected the presence of proteins,” Ranquet said. “Because it’s a very small quantity and they are difficult to detect, this might be dismissed as contamination: In workshops, artists used many different things, and maybe the eggs were just from the tempera.”

However, because adding egg yolk had such desirable effects on oil paint, the presence of proteins in the work might be an indication of deliberate use instead, the study suggested. Ranquet hopes that these preliminary findings might attract more curiosity toward this understudied topic.

Maria Perla Colombini, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Pisa in Italy, who was not involved in the study, agreed. “This exciting paper provides a new scenario for the understanding of old painting techniques,” she said in an email.

“The research group, reporting results from molecular level up to a macroscopic scale, contributes to a new knowledge in the use of egg yolk and oil binders. They are not more looking at simply identifying the materials used by Old Masters but explain how they could produce wonderful and glittering effects by employing and mixing the few available natural materials. They try to discover the secrets of old recipes of which little or nothing is written,” she added.

“This new knowledge contributes not only to a better conservation and preservation of artworks but also to a better comprehension of art history.”

The Conversation —

Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent.

Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations.

Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London’s last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world.

Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers).

In recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner’s legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries “The Secrets of Playboy” (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison.

Hefner and Playboy’s relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline “Tula” Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard — thin, white, able-bodied and blonde.

Meanwhile Hefner’s personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her “like a glorified pet” in her 2015 memoir, “Down the Rabbit Hole.”

Hefner’s passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in “The Secrets of Playboy” and called Hefner’s actions “abhorrent.”

The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company’s legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression.

Today, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from “Entertainment for Men” to “Pleasure for All.” Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women.

The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call “bunnies.”

On the app, creators — or bunnies — are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy’s future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor:

“If you’re a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you … If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.”

The bunnies next door

The stars of Playboy’s mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans.

“The Girls Next Door” launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner’s three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E’s best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy.

“The Girls Next Door” was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner’s many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right.

They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers.

The show’s depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls’ fight for agency, Hefner retaliated.

The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances.

In Madison and Wilkinson’s memoirs, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” and “Sliding into Home,” they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn’t credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent.

Fan interest in “The Girls Next Door” remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast “Girls Next Level,” where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show.

Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast — 14 years after the last episode of “The Girls Next Door” — speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner’s original editor’s note, Playboy resonates with some women.

Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property — be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing.

In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.

Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats.

Across runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade.

In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy.

For many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away.

The Fall-Winter failings

In 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others.

Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment.

According to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above.

“It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment.

“Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.”

For others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.”

That said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies.

There was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models.

It starts with sample size

Fashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show.

It’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.”

But despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.”

Beyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples.

London-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment. “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.”

Burns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?”

A case for change

Progress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.”

For British Vogue’s April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry.

“Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.”

But many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes.

In his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. “I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood… one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.”

But for White, the power rests within the entire industry — not just at the feet of brands. “I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,” she continued. “If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.”

Burns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. “I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,” she said. “It’s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.”

‘No such thing as a free lunch’

On March 8, Wegovy — developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions — was approved in the UK. It’s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country’s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010.

Similarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion.

While these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused.

Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). “It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,” said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk.

On March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. “Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,” read the release.

Patients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term “Ozempic Face,” coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled “Life After Food?” Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations.

And across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements.

“I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,” said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. “I’m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,” she said.

Although she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). “I’ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,” she told CNN.

Dr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. “If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,” he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. “These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.”

Every body is invited

Fashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue — regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty.

“There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,” said White. “The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.”

Not only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too.

“It shouldn’t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we’re not just looking at a single view of beauty,” echoed Burns.

Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season’s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: “The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.”",2025-11-14T17:20:55.219687

CNN —

In 1998, Michael Jordan laced up a pair of his iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship — and now they are the most expensive sneakers ever to sell at auction.



The game-winning sneakers sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York on Tuesday, smashing the sneaker auction record of $1.47 million, set in 2021 by a pair of Nike Air Ships that Jordan wore earlier in his career.

The sale arrives during “Jordan Year” — a reference to the NBA star player’s iconic jersey number 23. In January, Air Jordan partnered with Sotheby’s to auction off 13 pairs of retro sneakers that were designed in memory of The Notorious B.I.G. All lots outsold their high estimates of $5,000 by multiples, with the highest selling for more than $32,000.

Last year, Jordan’s Game 1 jersey, also from the 1998 finals, became the most expensive item of worn sports memorabilia to sell at auction when it fetched $10.1 million at a Sotheby’s sale.

Jordan’s farewell run with the Chicago Bulls is often referred to as “The Last Dance,” after the title of an ESPN and Netflix documentary that chronicled the season. Jordan announced his (second) retirement weeks before the finals, leading to the six-game series against the Utah Jazz becoming the most-watched in NBA history, based on Nielsen TV ratings. (Jordan would later return from 2001 to 2003 to play with the Washington Wizards, but did not win another championship).

“Michael Jordan game-worn sports memorabilia has proven time and time again to be the most elite and coveted items on the market,” said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby’s head of streetwear and modern collectables, in a press release prior to the sale. “However, items from his ‘Last Dance’ season are of a greater scale and magnitude as seen with our record-breaking sale of his Game 1 jersey in 2022.”

The pair of sneakers sold Tuesday were worn during Game 2, in Salt Lake City, which the Bulls won 93-88 after losing Game 1, with Jordan scoring 37 points. They are the last pair of black and red Air Jordan 13s that Jordan ever wore on the court for an NBA game, a press release from Sotheby’s noted.

Following Game 2, Jordan signed and gifted the set of worn shoes to the ball boy in the visitor’s locker room, as he was known to do, according to Sotheby’s.

The Air Jordan 13 sneakers starred in a sports memorabilia sale called “Victoriam,” which featured items worn by athletes including Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant and Roger Federer. Several other Jordan items were included in the two-part auction, with a game-worn 1998 Bulls jersey and a pair of 1985 Air Jordan 1s fetching $508,000 and $127,000 respectively.

Other top lots included one of Kobe Bryant’s LA Lakers shooting shirts, which sold for over $406,000, and a soccer jersey, worn by the late Pelé on his debut for the New York Cosmos in 1975, that sold fetched over $177,000.

Some people travel the world in search of adventure, while others seek out natural wonders, cultural landmarks or culinary experiences. But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America: strip clubs.

From Miami to Los Angeles, Prost’s latest book “Gentlemen’s Club” charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N’ Cream. There isn’t a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost’s camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves — and specifically their often-colorful facades.

Over the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida’s Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country’s more religious states.

“I’d divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,” Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email.

The first type, he added, could be found in “very American” settings, such as “around amusement parks and fast food and malls.” The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country’s south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as “conservatism and extreme puritanism.”

Prost insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project.

“The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,” he wrote in “Gentlemen’s Club,” photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March.

”(‘Gentlemen’s Club’ is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.”

‘A bit strange’

The genesis of Prost’s project dates back to his 2018 series, “After Party,” which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings’ exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project.

As he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that — unlike In Europe — they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside.

“A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,” Prost said.

Miami’s clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings.

If the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order “to not look suspicious… and explain what my intentions were,” he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project.

“Most of the time, people were OK — 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,” he said, adding they typically wouldn’t mind his presence, as long as he didn’t take photos of patrons or dancers.

“Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,” he said.

Prost said his biggest surprise, however, was how “normalized” strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, “The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized … You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.”

He was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants — with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers.

“I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers. That is also something that seems very American to me,” he said, adding: “I heard from some people I met in Portland there are even strip clubs (that offer) vegan food.”

Objects of desire

The facades are littered with jokes like “My sex life is like the Sahara, 2 palms, no dates” and pun-based names like Booby Trap and Bottoms Up. Prost’s documentarian approach heightens the signs’ surreal comedy. But it also doubles as a neutral lens through which viewers can make up their own minds about the objectification of women.

By honing in on the faceless dancing bodies of female silhouettes and the quintessential “girls girls girls” signs, “Gentleman’s Club” explores the commodification of women who are, in reality, completely absent in Prost’s works (an observation reflected in the book’s title, which is a phrase that crops up numerous times on signs throughout his photographs). The strip clubs he visited market women as things to be consumed, from the many food-themed names to an advertisement reading, “1,000’s of beautiful girls & three ugly ones.”

For his next project, Prost plans to visit Japan to document the nation’s love hotels, which occupy a similar role as strip clubs in some parts of the US: open secrets in a conservative society. But the photographer believes the American establishments he visited say something unique about the country — something that is less about sexuality and more about the American dream.

What his project has shown him is, he said, this: “As long as you’re successful in terms of business, (it doesn’t matter) if your activity deals with sex.”

CNN —

We all know the routine by heart: “Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.”

Now, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there’s an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them.

And mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can’t cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask.

Technology has advanced a great deal

Aviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s.

The digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft’s communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference.

But in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.)

The US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses – such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications – so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014.

2.2 billion passengers

Why then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect – ground interference.

Wireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that’s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here.

Of course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks – desirable for their higher speed data transfer – have caused concern for many within the aviation industry.

Radio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft.

Airport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out.

Ultimately, we can’t forget air rage

Most airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight.

On a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls.

For me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including “air rage”, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience.

Disruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews – typically identified as air rage.

In conclusion – in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft’s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers – it’s a lot of people to serve.

However, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we’ll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional – but landings are mandatory.",2025-11-14T17:21:07.408527

Paul Templer was living his best life.

He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris.

He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.”

Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos.

“It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.”

A good day for a river trek

The entire course of Paul Templer's life changed after he agreed at the last minute to take a group of tourists down the Zambezi River. Paul Templer

March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.”

The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak.

And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.”

Possible trouble ahead

Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.”

Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened.

Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. Paul Templer

“Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow.

“Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked.

Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb.

Attempting a rescue

Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe.

“I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said.

“But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.”

He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf.

“I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.”

What happened next was nightmarish and surreal.

“My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on.

“From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t.

“I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.”

Hippos: Huge, territorial and dangerous

There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic.

They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees.

Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half.

They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie).

Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles.

They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported.

“The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview.

“I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.”

Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either.

While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%.

‘He spat me out’

Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer.

“I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ”

So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free. Paul Templer

But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.”

He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time.

“This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself.

“I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.”

This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth.

Total fury

“And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said.

“For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart.

Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.”

He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes.

Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.”

The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though.

Who gets attacked and why

People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison.

“Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said.

Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said.

Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos.

“Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said.

“Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.”

Stuck on a rock and in a hard place

Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.”

Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.”

He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered.

“My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.”

Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks.

Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock.

He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back.

He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?”

It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would. Paul Templer on the pain after the attack

“I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.”

Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him.

“Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.”

Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock.

“And that was my bad day at the office.”

Next ordeal: Getting medical help

Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods.

It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live.

But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation.

He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.”

But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.”

He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.”

Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place.

“Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said.

“Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.”

Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses.

Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks

Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said.

“Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.”

Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.”

“Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce.

Warning signals

Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting.

“These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said.

If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill.

Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said.

What if you’re in a small watercraft?

“Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.”

It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said.

Once an attack is underway

Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins.

“Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order.

Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you. Rebecca Lewison

“Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said.

Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.”

Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go.

‘You’re the sum of your choices’

Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers).

How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life?

After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.”

Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.”

Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker.

Is a safari advisable?

Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s?

Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said.

Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run.

“My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.”",2025-11-14T17:21:09.974676

CNN —

He’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse.

In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture.

However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada.

He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka, which are usually passed down over generations.

“I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.”

Guesthouse dream

Daisuke and Hila Kajiyama transformed an abandoned farming residence in Japan into a guesthouse. Dai

When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country.

As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.”

According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, this number is likely to increase.

Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her.

“I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls.

He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river.

Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling.

“The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.”

Ghost house

Japan's countryside is littered with ghost houses, known as ""akiya."" Kajiyama managed to convince the owners of this house to let them take it over. Dai

Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned.

While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner.

“They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says.

Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot.

“It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city].

“The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.”

According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items.

During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so.

Authentic style

He spent around $40,000 renovating the house, completing much of the work himself. Dai

Although he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes.

He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000.

“I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background.

“From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.”

Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials.

He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses.

“They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted.

“The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.”

He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago.

“It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.”

Lengthy process

Yui Valley welcomed its first guests in 2014. Dai

He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help.

After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse.

As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses.

“This is how I started farming,” he says.

In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests.

“It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.”

He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker.

“I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India.

“People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.”

Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her.

“We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.”

While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished.

“It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.”

Complete transformation

The guesthouse has three bedrooms, which are available to rent for around $120 a night. Dai

He explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations.

“Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits.

Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years.

“Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house.

“Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here.

“So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].”

Kajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent.

“People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.”

As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley.

“She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.”

CNN —

Having lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I’ve had plenty of time to travel widely in China.

I’ve visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland’s 31 provinces.

Looking back, I’ve come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital’s boundaries.

Work on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China’s Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control.

Work eventually stopped in the 17th century.

Though not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties.

And while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion.

Whether you’re planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.)

Yongtai Turtle City

The Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of “wall.”

The Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall’s “Yellow River Defense Line,” was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use.

Today, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province.

While there aren’t many real turtles in the “Turtle City,” the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape.

The south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town’s oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it’s definitely worth your time.

Staying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos.

When in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles – both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People’s Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies.

Getting there: Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, has a major international airport and high-speed train connections from many cities in China. The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it’s only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers).

Mutianyu/Jiankou

The Mutianyu and Jiankou sections of wall are about 25 kilometers in length. Alex Sherr

Mutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon – two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing’s mountaintops.

Historical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you’ll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement.

These two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience.

Mutianyu is the best portion of the “tourist wall.” Restored in the 1980s, it’s very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top.

To the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the “wild wall” – no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns.

Mutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it’s highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows.

Jiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home.

For lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice.

In fall and spring, shades of the wall’s gray brick contrast with nature’s vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos.

For winter sports enthusiasts, there’s skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu.

Getting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019, so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.)

You can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station.

Getting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car.

Bataizi

Bataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary.

The church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing.

The juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon.

After finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village’s “new” church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village’s long connection with Catholicism.

Besides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable.

Late summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you’ll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills.

Getting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province’s largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi – about a 35-minute drive.

Datong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43).

Alternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi.

In Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites.

Laoniuwan (aka the Old Ox Bend Great Wall)

As the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands.

The Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544.

Laoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia.

Late summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you’ll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure.

Along the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning.

A boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You’ll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects.

Getting there: Laoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi – this way, you’ll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip.

Pianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year.

Fairy Tower

Simatai's Fairy Tower is a sight to behold. Alex Sherr

Construction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty.

The Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access.

Instead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It’s a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear.

As with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction.

The hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians’ supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side.

It makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson.

Five-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou’s Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites.

Getting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing’s Miyun district.

Tangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there.

You can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there.

Dushikou

Dushikou stand seven meters tall in some spots. Alex Sherr

Constructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots – no small feat considering it was made by piling stones.

It’s located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province.

The piled-stone wall at Dushikou is unique, as many other sections of the Great Wall close to Beijing were constructed using kiln-fired bricks.

Dushikou is best visited in the summer, specifically July and August, when the rolling hills of the surrounding grasslands are peak green. Cool evenings make for perfect outdoor barbecue/bonfire weather.

You’ll be able to find clean and comfortable farmhouse lodgings in Dushikou town; alternatively, Chicheng, 45 minutes away, has a range of hotels to choose from.

Lamb skewers and roast leg of lamb are specialties in these parts, as this part of Hebei is very close to the border with Inner Mongolia. Noodle lovers should also try the local oat noodles, which are delicious.

Getting there: Thanks to all the infrastructure built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the drive to Dushikou has been shortened by almost two hours. If you prefer not to drive, hop on a bus to Chicheng from the Liuliqiao Transport Hub in Beijing and take a 45-minute taxi ride to Dushikou.

Note that public transportation will take one or two hours longer than private car.",2025-11-14T17:21:25.906221

Nelly Cheboi, who in 2019 quit a lucrative software engineering job in Chicago to create computer labs for Kenyan schoolchildren, is the 2022 CNN Hero of the Year.

Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes.

Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future.

Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up.

As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit.

“The world is your oyster when you are educated”

Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.”

A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop.

Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major.

“When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN.

Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum.

“I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said.

Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure.

“We have kids here (in Kenya) — myself included, back in the day — who don’t even know what a computer is,” she said.

So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself.

“At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said.

A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals.

The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs.

“We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.”

The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more.

“My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.”

An inspiring night of heroism and advocacy

CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters.

“We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.”

Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added.

Debra Vines – whose nonprofit The Answer Inc. supports families impacted by autism in underserved communities across Chicago – was honored by actress Holly Robinson Peete, a “fellow autism mom.”

Vines says her group has provided programming and guidance to more than 4,000 families. “Join me and be a servant for the change today,” Vines said when accepting her award.

And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker ​​and her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue.

Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders:

Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started “Three Wishes for Ruby’s Residents,” which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn’t otherwise afford them.

Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started “Recycle My Battery,” which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins.

The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media.

Contribute

CNN has partnered with GoFundMe to enable donations to this year’s Top 10 honorees. GoFundMe is the world’s largest fundraising platform that empowers people and charities to give and receive help. Supporters can make online donations to the Top 10 CNN Heroes’ non-profit organizations directly from CNNHeroes.com.

There are other cards that offer higher cash back rates on certain categories, and while they can be worth it, they do require more effort.

The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card is perfect for someone that wants an easy-to-use card that still offers high rewards: you’ll earn a best-in-class flat rewards right away on your purchases -- with no limits or hoops to jump through.

$200 cash rewards welcome offer -- New Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card holders can earn a $200 cash rewards welcome offer for spending just $500 in purchases in the first 3 months. Not only is this a very competitive sign-up bonus for a card with no annual fee, but it's also one of the things that sets this Wells Fargo credit card apart from other 2% back cards.

It means that this card will allow you to avoid interest on purchases and balance transfers for a full year!

No annual fee -- In many cases, high rewards rates mean high annual fees. Not with the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, which sports a $0 annual fee.

Cell phone protection -- With the price of a typical cell phone in the hundreds of dollars, having some sort of insurance is a good idea.

Just because it’s on the internet doesn’t make it true. It seems so simple, but if everyone knew that, Facebook and Google wouldn’t have to pull bogus news sites from their advertising algorithms and people wouldn’t breathlessly share stories that claim Donald Trump is a secret lizard person or Hillary Clinton is an android in a pantsuit.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Fake news is actually really easy to spot – if you know how. Consider this your New Media Literacy Guide.

NOTE: As we put this together, we sought the input of two communications experts: Dr. Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts whose dynamic list of unreliable news sites has gone viral, and Alexios Mantzarlis, the head of the International Fact-Checking Network at the Poynter Institute.

First, know the different types of misleading and false news 1. Fake news These are the easiest to debunk and often come from known sham sites that are designed to look like real news outlets. They may include misleading photographs and headlines that, at first read, sound like they could be real. 2. Misleading news These are the hardest to debunk, because they often contain a kernel of truth: A fact, event or quote that has been taken out of context. Look for sensational headlines that aren’t supported by the information in the article. 3. Highly partisan news A type of misleading news, this may be an interpretation of a real news event where the facts are manipulated to fit an agenda. 4. Clickbait The shocking or teasing headlines of these stories trick you into clicking for more information – which may or may not live up to what was promised. 5. Satire This one is tough, because satire doesn’t pretend to be real and serves a purpose as commentary or entertainment. But if people are not familiar with a satire site, they can share the news as if it is legitimate.

Second, hone your fact-checking skills Alexios Mantzarlis trains fact-checkers for a living. He says it’s important to have a “healthy amount of skepticism” and to think, really think, before sharing a piece of news. “If we were a little slower to share and re-tweet content purely based on the headline, we’d go a good way towards combating flasehoods,” he told CNN. Melissa Zimdars points out that even those who spend a lot of time online aren’t immune to fake content. “People think this [thinking] applies only for older people,” she told CNN. “I think even early education should be teaching about communication, media and the internet. Growing up with the internet doesn’t necessarily mean you’re internet savvy.”

For starters, here are 10 questions you should ask if something looks fake:

1. Does the story come from a strange URL?

Zimdars says sites with strange suffixes like “.co” or “.su,” or that are hosted by third party platforms like WordPress should raise a red flag. Some fake sites, like National Report, have legitimate-sounding, if not overly general names that can easily trick people on social sites. For instance, several fake reports from abcnews.com.co have gone viral before being debunked, including a June article that claimed President Obama signed an order banning assault weapon sales.

2. Does the headline match the information in the article?

Mantzarlis says one of the biggest reasons bogus news spreads on Facebook is because people get sucked in by a headline and don’t bother to click through.

Just this week, several dubious organizations circulated a story about Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi. “Pepsi STOCK Plummets After CEO Tells Trump Supporters to ‘Take Their Business Elsewhere’,” trumpeted one such headline.

However, the articles themselves didn’t contain that quote nor evidence that Pepsi’s stock saw a significant drop (it didn’t). Nooyi did make recorded comments about Trump’s election, but was never quoted telling his supporters to “take their business elsewhere.”

3. Is it a recent story, or an old one that has been re-purposed?

Sometimes legitimate news stories can be twisted and resurrected years after the fact to create a false conflation of events. Mantzarlis recalls an erroneous story that actually cited a legitimate piece of news from CNNMoney.

A blog called Viral Liberty recently reported that Ford had moved production of some of their trucks from Mexico to Ohio because of Donald Trump’s election win. The story quickly caught fire online – after all, it seemed like a great win for the domestic auto industry.

It turns out, Ford did move some manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio – in 2015. It had nothing to do with the election results at all.

4. Are the supporting videos or photos verifiable?

Photos and videos can also be taken out of context to support a false claim. In April, the liberal site Occupy Democrats posted a video that purportedly showed a young woman getting removed from a bathroom by police for not looking feminine enough. This was during the height of the HB2 “bathroom bill” controversy, and the article clearly linked the two. “IT BEGINS,” read the headline.

However, there was no date on the video or evidence that it was shot in North Carolina, where the “bathroom bill” was to be passed.

In fact, according to Snopes, the same video was published to a Facebook page in 2015, meaning it predated the HB2 controversy.

5. Does the article cite primary sources?

It’s not just political news that can be bogus. Now8News is one of the most infamous fake-but-looks-real site, specializing in the kind of weird news stories that often go viral.

One such article claims Coca-Cola recalled Dasani water bottles after a “clear parasite” was found in the water. There was even an accompanying gross-out picture that allegedly showed the parasite, though some basic Googling reveals it is most likely a photo of a young eel.

Regardless, the article had no statement or claim from any company. Clearly this would be a big story. Dasani or any number of consumer advocacy groups would publish statements or news releases about it, right? There are none to be found – because the story is 100% fake.

6. Does the story feature quotes, and are they traceable?

Other 98%

A favorite meme of Liberal Facebook groups features a fake quote from Donald Trump that is allegedly from a People Magazine interview in 1998:

“If I were to run, I’d run as a Republican. They’re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they’d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.”

This one is easily debunked if you take even a moment to think about it: People.com has extensive archives, and this quote is nowhere to be found in them.

7. Is it the only outlet reporting the story?

During this election season, Pope Francis was roped into three super viral, and completely false, stories. According to various (fake) websites, the Pope endorsed three US Presidential candidates: First, Bernie Sanders, as “reported” by National Report and USAToday.com.co. Then, Donald Trump, as “reported” by fake news site WTOE 5 News. Finally, another fake news site KYPO6.com reported he had endorsed Hillary Clinton!

In all of these instances, subsequent reports all circled back to the fake ones. It’s always good to trace a story back to the original source, and if you find yourself in a loop – or if they all lead back to the same dubious site – you have reason to doubt.

8. Is your own bias getting in the way?

JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Both Zimdars and Mantzarlis say confirmation bias is a big reason fake news speads like it does. Some of that is built into Facebook’s algorithm – the more you like or interact with a certain interest, the more Facebook will show you related to that interest.

Similarly, if you hate Donald Trump, you are more likely to think negative stories about Donald Trump are true, even if there is no evidence.

“We seek out information that already fits with our established beliefs,” says Zimdars. “If we come into contact with information we don’t agree with, it still may reaffirm us because we will attempt to find faults.”

So if you find an outrageous article that feels “too good to be true,” use caution: It just might be.

9. Has it been debunked by a reputable fact-checking organization?

Did you know there is actually an International Fact-Checking Network (which Mantzarlis leads)? And that it has a code of principles? The code includes the ideals of nonpartisanship and transparency, among others. Sites like FactCheck.org, Snopes and Politifact abide by this code, so if you see a debunking there, you know you’re getting the real deal. View the whole list here.

10. Is the host on a list of unreliable news websites?

This is where things can get tricky. There’s obviously a big difference between “misleading” news, which is usually based in fact, and “fake” news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. Zimdars’ now-famous list covers both kinds, as well as satire and sites that capitalize on clickbait-type headlines. Snopes also maintains a list.

While Zimdars is glad her list has gotten so much attention, she also cautions that completely writng off some of the sites as “fake” is not accurate. “I want to make sure this list doesn’t do a great disservice to the ultimate goal,” she says. “It’s interesting that some of the headlines [about my list] are just as hyperbolic as the ones I am analyzing.”",2025-11-14T17:22:11.792626

CNN —

It is a car kitted out with technology its developers boldly predict will transform our cities and change the way we live.

The autonomous “DevBot #1” took a giant leap forward in Morocco recently, making its debut on a street track at the Formula E Marrakech ePrix.

The battery-powered prototype is being tested for Roborace – a proposed race series where driverless cars will compete on temporary city circuits.

“It’s the first time we’ve run the Devbot in driverless mode on a Formula E track in the middle of a city street,” Roborace’s Justin Cooke told CNN.

“It’s so exciting for the team who put hours and hours of work in. These guys were up to 1-2 a.m. in the morning developing a technology that no one else in the world is able to do at this speed and in these complicated environments.”

Read: Electric race car showcases driverless future

Using a variety of sensors – including GPS, radar and ultrasonics – allied to sophisticated computer programs, the car learns how to navigate a track at speed avoiding all obstacles.

“What we are doing is at the forefront of technology right now,” says Cooke, who is also CMO of Kinetik – an investment company founded by Russian businessman Denis Sverdlov which is providing financial backing for the project.

“There are two or three kinds of space races, if you will – some people are going to Mars, we’re developing robotic cars and I think it’s probably one of the most, if not the most exciting space in the world right now.”

After the successful 30-minute test in Marrakech – this year’s host city for the United Nations climate change conference (COP22) – Cooke say the company will next try racing two cars together on track with the eventual aim of having up to 10 cars competing at every Formula E ePrix weekend.

A new robot race car series is set to get underway in 2017. Roborace Ltd. The planned ""Roborace"" series is scheduled to be contested during Formula E championship weekends.

The car successfully navigated the track at Formula E's Marrakech ePrix in November. The all-electric race series will host robot races during ePrix weekends. Matt Knight/CNN The car has been developed by a small team of engineers and computer scientists. ""With this car we have several kinds of sensors,"" Sergey Malygin, Roborace's Artificial Intelligence developer, told CNN. ""First of all there are lasers measurements -- light-based, so we have information about the 3D objects around us."" Matt Knight/CNN ""Also we have cameras, radars, ultrasonics to get the information about other vehicles and base stations,"" Malygin continues. ""We also have precise positioning systems and optical speed sensors.""

The raw data is then deciphered by algorithms which tells the car where the walls are and where other cars are on the road. Matt Knight/CNN Roborace engineer, Matas Simonavicius, says each wheel is individually powered, providing more stability and safety.

Tampa, Florida CNN —

When it comes to piloting a plane, I have zero experience.

In fact, I’ve never even considered attempting it.

Nevertheless, as we swoop over Florida’s Tampa Bay on a gorgeous November morning, I enthusiastically take over the controls of the ICON A5, a two-seater amphibious plane that looks like a sports car, maneuvers like a jet ski and is so intuitive, the company says that even a novice can learn to fly it in less than 30 hours.

At 23 feet long and weighing in a 1,510 pounds, it’s known as a sea light-sport aircraft.

Designed to help you focus on the freedom of flying without worrying if the plane will react unpredictably, there’s nothing else quite like it on the market.

Now that I’m in control, my whole body tenses for a good five minutes. Am I really ready to pilot this shiny new machine all by myself? I’m not entirely sure.

However, I take comfort in the fact that the A5 was built specifically for people like me, and it was designed to drive like a car.

Plus, the fact that Icon’s CEO and founder, Kirk Hawkins, is next to me in the cockpit doesn’t hurt either. He can take over the controls at any time.

So far, so good.

We glide smoothly through the air at about 1,000 feet, and I’m comfortable enough to take in the sights. Lovely Fort De Soto Park doesn’t disappoint.

Squiggles of dreamy white dunes are surrounded by water that looks like it should be in the Caribbean.

The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, with its series of long-spanning cables, is equally impressive.

The adrenaline is still racing. And as most surreal experiences go, it just keeps getting better.

For starters, there’s another ICON A5 to my left, which is thrilling in itself. We are flying in formation, and my job is to mimic its movements. You’d think this would be intimidating, but it’s not.

It’s just plain fun.

That’s music to Hawkins’ ears. He’s the brains behind this newfangled plane, an idea 10 years in the making.

As a former Air Force F-16 pilot and a Stanford Business School grad, he has focused most of his adult life on making sport flying available to the masses.

“The idea for us was to create an airplane where the average human being can go out and experience the world without having the burden of becoming a professional pilot,” he says.

So it makes sense that the dashboard looks like what you see in your car. There are only a few gauges that I don’t recognize.

“It’s the Apple approach to things,” he says. “You humanize it, and make it intuitive and easy and cool.”

He’s so confident people will want to fly (and buy) his planes that he just opened a flight-training facility at Peter O. Knight Airport.

Located on Davis Island, five minutes from downtown Tampa, it’s a place where both beauty and sailboats abound.

The company’s other training center is in Vacaville, California, where ICON is headquartered.

Wide eyes and open windows

By 9 a.m., it’s time for a brief water-landing pitstop.

Hawkins takes over the controls. I’ve been too busy learning to fly in formation (not something non-pilots get to try very often) and interviewing Hawkins to even think about learning to do a water landing myself. It’s something Hawkins tells me most people can master in about 30 minutes.

A few negative-Gs and 360-degree turns later and it becomes a fun roller-coaster ride in the sky. Plus, it’s an open-air flight, so I occasionally flop my arms out. Just because I can.

At a few hundred feet above the water, it’s easy to spot a boater waving at us, a flock of pelicans and even stingrays.

“We’re gonna pull over here and stop and get out for a second,” he says.

Surely he’s kidding, right? But after landing the plane on the water, he takes off his seatbelt, and I realize he’s not.

Sky pioneers: A light aircraft revolution is taking off

Seconds later, he pops the roof and we climb onto the wings, which could easily double as diving boards. Suddenly, this feels less like a plane outing and more like I’m on a boat sunbathing.

Everything is drenched in a mesmerizing golden hue. I can imagine picnicking on the beach nearby. Or taking the plane somewhere for a remote weekend camping trip.

Because the plane has a range of about 430 miles on a full tank, it’s made for short getaways.

“This entire thing is about inspiring people,” he explains. “Once you learn to fly, you will never be the same. You will look at the sky different, you will look at the planet different.”

Designed to make flying simple

“The primary motor skills for operating a plane are pretty easy,” Hawkins tells me. “We have people landing by themselves with an instructor on their very first day, within 30 minutes.”

That said, they’ve painstakingly taken the time to design it for safety. The goal of the spin-resistant airframe feature is that if the pilot makes mistakes, the airplane doesn’t lose control.

As a backup, there’s a complete airplane parachute.

“The spin resistance feature is a big deal as it’s the first airplane that the FAA has deemed spin-resistant,” says Chris Dupin, a flight instructor and US Air Force officer. “A significant number of general aviation fatalities are from loss of control accidents that involve an unrecovered spin on the base to final turn.”

Plus, there’s the angle of attack indicator, something you don’t typically see in a light aircraft. It shows you where the wing is happy (in the green) or where it could stall (in the red).

The pilot’s job is to keep the wing within the green or yellow section of the gauge. This is part of what makes water takeoffs and landings so easy to learn.

Becoming a barnstormer

“Kirk Hawkins has an extremely creative and innovative idea for pilot training that is more intuitive; teaching the feel of flight first and the principals and structure later, not unlike how people learn to drive,” says Christine Negroni, veteran aviation journalist and author of “The Crash Detectives.”

“The world is facing a pilot shortage, so the idea of teaching differently, so that different learning styles can be accommodated could very well expand the pool of pilot candidates.”

On that note, about 40% of the folks who’ve put down deposits for the ICON A5 are not pilots, which means this plane is drawing aviation newbies.

After an hour and a half of flying time, Hawkins lands us on the airport runway, a maneuver that you can tackle after you’ve mastered several water landings. It’s a bit trickier since it requires more precision and knowledge about crosswinds.

At this point, if I owned this plane, I’d hook it up to a trailer, fold the wings up, drive it home, and park it in the garage.

Get some air time

If you want your own ICON A5, get in line. More than 1,800 customers have put deposits down.

For those who aren’t ready to shell out $207,000 to buy one, there’s the option of stopping by ICON’s training facility in Tampa, or the facility in Vacaville, California, to fly for the day.

CNN —

They may be teenagers, but 17-year-old Brittany Bull and 16-year-old Sesam Mngqengqiswa have grand ambitions – to launch Africa’s first private satellite into space in 2019.

They are part of a team of high school girls from Cape Town, South Africa, who have designed and built payloads for a satellite that will orbit over the earth’s poles scanning Africa’s surface.

Once in space, the satellite will collect information on agriculture, and food security within the continent.

Using the data transmitted, “we can try to determine and predict the problems Africa will be facing in the future”, explains Bull, a student at Pelican Park High School.

South Africa's program aims to encourage girls into STEM, particularly astronomy. Less than 10% of young women are interested in STEM subjects. Coursey Karl Schoemaker

“Where our food is growing, where we can plant more trees and vegetation and also how we can monitor remote areas,” she says. “We have a lot of forest fires and floods but we don’t always get out there in time.”

Information received twice a day will go towards disaster prevention.

It’s part of a project by South Africa’s Meta Economic Development Organization (MEDO) working with Morehead State University in the US.

Africa has been slow to embark on space travel. But new projects on the continent look promising. South Africa's ambitious Square Kilometer Array project aims to build the world's biggest radio telescope that will help scientists paint a detailed picture of some of the deepest reaches of outer space.

Ambitious first

The girls (14 in total) are being trained by satellite engineers from Cape Peninsula University of Technology, in a bid to encourage more African women into STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics).

If the launch is successful, it will make MEDO the first private company in Africa to build a satellite and send it into orbit.

“We expect to receive a good signal, which will allow us to receive reliable data,” declares an enthusiastic Mngqengqiswa, of Philippi High School. “In South Africa we have experienced some of the worst floods and droughts and it has really affected the farmers very badly.”

By 2020 80% of jobs will be related to STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics), MEDO predicts, but currently only 14% of the STEM workforce globally are women. Coursey Karl Schoemaker

Drought and environmental effects from climate change have continued to plague the country in recent years. An El Niño induced drought led to a shortfall of 9.3 million tons in southern Africa’s April 2016 maize production, according to a UN report.

“It has caused our economy to drop … This is a way of looking at how we can boost our economy,” says the young Mngqengqiswa.

Initial trials involved the girls programming and launching small CricketSat satellites using high-altitude weather balloons, before eventually helping to configure the satellite payloads.

Small format satellites are low cost ways of gathering data on the planet quickly. Tests so far have involved collecting thermal imaging data which is then interpreted for early flood or drought detection.

“It’s a new field for us [in Africa] but I think with it we would be able to make positive changes to our economy,” says Mngqengqiswa.

Ultimately, it is hoped the project will include girls from Namibia, Malawi, Kenya, and Rwanda.

Mngqengqiswa comes from a single parent household. Her mother is a domestic worker. By becoming a space engineer or astronaut, the teenager hopes to make her mother proud.

“Discovering space and seeing the Earth’s atmosphere, it’s not something many black Africans have been able to do, or do not get the opportunity to look at,” says Mngqengqiswa.

The schoolgirl is right; in half a century of space travel, no black African has journeyed to outer space. “I want to see these things for myself,” says Mngqengqiswa, “I want to be able to experience these things.”

Her team mate, Bull agrees: “I want to show to fellow girls that we don’t need to sit around or limit ourselves. Any career is possible – even aerospace.”",2025-11-14T17:22:39.168753

CNN —

A six-month stay on the International Space Station can be a pain in the back for astronauts. While they may gain up to 2 inches in height temporarily, that effect is accompanied by a weakening of the muscles supporting the spine, according to a new study.

In 1994, astronaut Mark Lee had his height measured by fellow astronaut Jerry Linenger as part of a study on back pain. NASA

Astronauts have been reporting back pain since the late 1980s, when space missions grew longer. Their flight medical data show that more than half of US astronauts have reported back pain, especially in their lower backs. Up to 28% indicated that it was moderate to severe pain, sometimes lasting the duration of their mission.

Things don’t improve when they return to Earth’s gravity. In the first year after their mission, astronauts have a 4.3 times higher risk of a herniated disc.

“It’s sort of an ongoing problem that has been a significant one with cause for concern,” said Dr. Douglas Chang, first author of the new study and associate professor of orthopedic surgery and chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation service at University of California San Diego Health. “So this study is the first to take it from just an epidemiological description and look at the possible mechanisms for what is going on with the astronauts’ backs.”

Like being in a body cast

Much attention has been focused on intervertebral discs, the spongy shock absorbers that sit between our vertebrae, as the culprit for the back issues that astronauts face. But the new study runs counter to that thinking. In this research, funded by NASA, Chang’s team observed little to no changes in the discs, their height or swelling.

What they did observe in six astronauts who spent four to seven months on the ISS was a tremendous degeneration and atrophying of the supporting musculature in the lumbar (lower) spine, Chang said. These muscles are the ones that help us stay upright, walk and move our upper extremities in an environment like Earth, while protecting discs and ligaments from strain or injury.

In microgravity, the torso lengthens, most likely due to spinal unloading, in which the spinal curvature flattens. Astronauts also aren’t using the muscle tone in their lower backs because they aren’t bending over or using their lower backs to move, like on Earth, Chang said. This is where the pain and stiffening occurs, much like if the astronauts were in a body cast for six months.

MRI scans before and after the missions revealed that the astronauts experienced a 19% decrease in these muscles during their flight. “Even after six weeks of training and reconditioning here one Earth, they are only getting about 68% of their losses restored,” Chang explained.

Chang and his team consider this a serious issue for long-term manned missions, especially when considering a trip to Mars that could take eight or nine months just to reach the Red Planet. That trip, and the astronauts’ potential time spent in Martian gravity – 38% of the surface gravity on Earth – creates the potential for muscle atrophy and deconditioning.

The team’s future research will also look at reported neck issues, where there can be even more occurrences of muscle atrophy and a slower recovery period. They are also hoping to partner with another university on inflight ultrasounds of the spine, to look at what happens to astronauts while they are on the space station.

Yoga in space?

Because nobody likes back pain and muscle loss, Chang suggested countermeasures that should be added to the already two- to three-hour workout astronauts have on the space station each day. Though their exercise machines focus on a range of issues including cardiovascular and skeletal health, the team believes that space travelers also need to include a core-strenghtening program focused on the spine.

In addition to the “fetal tuck” position astronauts use in microgravity to stretch their lower back or alleviate back pain, Chang suggested yoga. But he knows that is easier said than done.

“A lot of yoga depends on the effects of gravity, like downward dog, where a stretch through the hamstring, calf muscles, back of the neck and shoulders are possible because of gravity. When you remove that, you may not have the same benefit.”

Any machines on the space station also have to be designed with regards to weight, size and even the reverberations they could produce on the station.

Chang and the other researchers brainstormed with a virtual reality team about different exercise programs that would enable astronauts to invite friends, family or even Twitter followers to join them in a virtual workout, making the daily repetition of their workouts more fun and competitive.

One of Chang’s teammates has felt this pain personally. Dr. Scott Parazynski is the only astronaut to summit Mount Everest. He experienced a herniated disc after returning from the ISS to Earth. Less than a year later, when he attempted to climb Everest the first time, he had to be airlifted off. After a rehabilitation process, he eventually made the summit. Now, he speaks to current astronauts about the ways they can contribute to studies about their health in microgravity.

Keeping the astronauts healthy and fit is the least they can do, Chang said.

“When a crew comes back, they say on one side of the space station, they see this beautiful blue planet,” he said. “Everything they hold dear to them is on this fragile little planet. And they look out the other window and just see infinity stretching off into the blackness, and they come back with a different sense of themselves and their place in the universe.

“All of them are committed to furthering space knowledge and making incremental steps forward in any way they can for the next crew.”",2025-11-14T17:22:42.944005

CNN —

“Attention! Attention!” blares the Russian voice from a loudspeaker. “The nuclear bombs will be launched in one hour.”

Inside a room styled as a Soviet-era nuclear bunker, a couple of Russians race to prevent a catastrophic strike on the United States.

Their quest – the latest craze in Moscow – is to find the nuclear launch codes and deactivate a hidden red button, which has already been pressed by a mad Russian general.

It’s complete fantasy; just an interactive game hosted in a building in a former industrial area of the city, harking back to the fears of the Cold War.

But amid the current tensions with Russia, in which potential nuclear confrontation with the West has again been raised, it feels a little unsettling.

“I’m worried because there is very stupid information from both sides,” said Maxim Motin, a Russian who has just completed the Red Button Quest game.

“I know that normal people all over the world don’t want any war,” he added.

A nation preparing for conflict

But Russian officials have been preparing the nation for the possibility of conflict, stoking deep-seated concerns about a standoff with the West, Russia’s old Cold War rival.

Russian television has been broadcasting a mass training exercise, involving up to 40 million people across the country. It is designed to prepare responses, the government says, for a chemical or nuclear attack.

The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry issued this picture from a nationwide civil defense drill Ministry of Emergency Situations/AP

The video shows emergency workers with protective suits and gas masks leading the civil defense rehearsal, the biggest of its kind since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It suggests the Kremlin wants Russians to take the threat of war very seriously.

Of course, all-out conflict between Russia and the West remains highly unlikely.

Analysts say the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction – or MAD – still holds as a deterrent, just as it did during the Cold War.

But with tensions growing over Syria, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, analysts say a small risk of contact, misunderstanding and escalation between the nuclear superpowers has become very real.

“I don’t think nuclear war is likely,” says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs, a prominent foreign policy journal.

“But when two nuclear superpowers are operating with their military machines in the same area, very close to each other and they don’t have proper coordination, any unintended thing can happen,” he told CNN.

Kremlin playing up fears

It is a risk the Kremlin seems keen to play up, with state television upping its hardline rhetoric in recent weeks.

In its flagship current affairs show, Russia’s top state news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyev – dubbed the Kremlin’s propagandist-in-chief by critics – recently issued a stark warning of global war if Russian and US forces clash in Syria.

“Brutish behavior towards Russia could have nuclear dimensions,” he declared.

The Russian defense ministry has also released details of the latest intercontinental ballistic missile being added to its nuclear arsenal.

The Satan 2, as it’s known, will be the world’s most destructive weapon, guaranteeing Russia’s place as a top nuclear power.

It is an apocalyptic vision that adds a further sense of realism to the fantasy quest being acted out by gamers in Moscow.

“I know that now in schools in Russia they tell the children that our main enemy is the US,” said Alisa Sokoleva, another Moscow gamer.

“But it sounds ridiculous to me and I’m totally sure that war is impossible,” she adds.

Back in the fake Cold War bunker, the Russian gamers have cracked the launch codes and deactivated the missile launch. The United States, it seems, has again been saved from this virtual Russian nuclear attack.

Hopefully, the real world will be spared such a confrontation too.",2025-11-14T17:22:45.713483

Tokyo's first Wearable Expo debuted in 2015 and was largest in the world. Japan's wearable tech market is predicted to grow from 530,000 in 2013 to 13.1 million units in 2017.

CNN —

What do Discman, Tamagotchi, and Game Boy have in common?

They’re all landmark Japanese inventions from the 80s and 90s, symbols of an era when the Asian nation was a world leader in tech innovation.

But with the rise of Silicon Valley, and American tech giants such as Google and Apple, has seen Japan produce less era-defining tech over the past two decades.

That, says Professor Masahiko Tsukamoto, of Kobe University’s Graduate School of Engineering, is about to change thanks to a new generation of young entrepreneurs, an uptick in international collaborations, and new partnerships with university scientists.

Japan’s focus this time around is not on smart phones or gaming, but wearable chairs, smart glasses and dog communication devices.

In short, wacky wearable tech.

Wearable tech in Japan

In 2013, Japan sold 530,000 units of wearable tech devices, according to Yano Research Institute.

That figure is predicted to leapfrog to 13.1 million units in 2017.

Perhaps the best indication of the boom in this industry was the introduction of Tokyo’s first Wearable Expo in 2015 – at launch, it was the largest wearable tech fair in the world with 103 exhibitors.

It has featured electronic kimonos, cat communication devices, and electronic gloves to record a pianist’s finger work.

At the next show, from January 18 to 20, 2017, the organizers expect more than 200 exhibitors and 19,000 visitors.

“With better functionality, lighter components and smaller designs, wearing devices is now no longer a fantasy,” says show director Yuhi Maezono. “Wearables are gathering attention as the next big growth market.”

The dog whisperer

Inupathy is a dog harness slated to launch at the end of this year that will allow pet owners to communicate with their dogs.

As well as a heart monitor, the harness features noise-canceling technology which can isolate the animal’s heartbeat and track its reactions to stimulus, such as food, games, people and toys.

With this data, the harness assesses a dog’s mood and changes color to inform the owners.

Equipped with six LED lights, the collar glows blue to show calm, red for excitement, and displays a rainbow theme for happiness.

Joji Yamaguchi, CEO of Inupathy, was inspired by his Corgi, Akane, who was a nervous puppy. To better understand the dog’s anxiety, the biologist developed Inupathy to monitor his heart rate.

“I always felt like I couldn’t understand Akane very well and I wanted to get be closer to him,” says Yamaguchi.

“Buddhism and old Japanese religion says every animals, plants, and even rocks have spirit inside. It’s stressful when you can’t solve problems that are upsetting them.”

Yamaguchi expects wearable wellness tracking will have applications for humans, too.

“Personalization, of artificial intelligence will be a game-changer,” says Yamaguchi.

“For instance, if you show a certain behavior before you start feeling depressed, predicting your depression from that behavior is extremely valuable for an individual. An AI that works personally for you will eventually make this possible.”

A real life-saver

Archelis – a wearable chair launched in Japan this year – is also creating a buzz internationally.

A collaboration between Nitto mold factory, Chiba University, Japan Polymer Technology and Hiroaki Nishimura Design, in Japan, it was initially intended for surgeons, who need to rest their legs during long operations.

The chair enables its wearer to effectively sit down and stand up at the same time.

The Archelis chair. Archelis

“The Archelis concept is very simple, like the simplicity of Columbus’ egg,” says Dr Hiroshi Kawahira, the surgeon behind the concept. “Long surgeries can result in back pain, neck pain, and knee pain – especially for surgeons who are older.”

Made of 3D-printed panels, Archelis does not require any electrical components or batteries.

The innovation is in the effective design: flexible carbon panels wrap around the buttocks, legs and feet to provide support and minimize pressure on joints.

The system stabilizes the ankles and knees, so the pressure from being upright is spread evenly across the shins and thighs.

Though the wearer appears to be standing, in fact, they are resting their back and legs while working on their feet.

Get to the point

Other wearables are on the smaller side.

CNN —

These days, teachers often face classrooms filled with yawning students who stayed up late snapping selfies or playing online games.

For children and teens, using cell phones, tablets and computers at night is associated with losing sleep time and sleep quality, new research finds. Even children who don’t use their phones or the other technologies littering their bedrooms at night are losing shut-eye and becoming prone to daylight sleepiness, the analysis published today in JAMA Pediatrics finds.

The analysis found “a consistent pattern of effect across a wide range of countries and settings,” said Dr. Ben Carter, lead author and a senior lecturer in biostatistics at King’s College London.

Carter and his colleagues weeded through the medical literature to identify hundreds of applicable studies conducted between January 1, 2011, and June 15, 2015. They chose 20 research reports involving a total of 125,198 children, evenly divided by gender, with an average age of 14½ years. After extracting pertinent data, Carter and his co-authors performed their own meta-analysis.

Few parents will be surprised by the results: The team found a “strong and consistent association” between bedtime media device use and inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness.

Surprisingly, though, Carter and his team discovered that children who did not use their devices in their bedrooms still had their sleep interrupted and were likely to suffer the same problems. The lights and sounds emitted by the technology, as well as the content itself, may be too stimulating.

Though Carter admits that a weakness of the analysis was “how the data was collected in the primary studies: self-reported by parents and children,” many of us will probably recognize our own families’ habits reflected in the statistics.

Electronic bedroom

A large-scale poll conducted in the United States by the National Sleep Foundation (PDF) reported in 2013 that 72% of all children and 89% of teens have at least one device in their sleep environment. Most of this technology is used near bedtime, that same report found.

According to Carter and his co-authors, this omnipresent technology negatively influences children’s sleep by delaying their sleep time, as they finish watching a movie or play one more game.

Light emitted from these devices may also affect the circadian rhythm, the internal clock timing biological processes, including body temperature and hormone release, the researchers explain. One specific hormone, melatonin, induces tiredness and contributes to the timing of our sleep-wake cycles. Electronic lights can delay the release of melatonin, disrupting this cycle and making it harder to fall asleep.

Carter and his co-authors also suggest that online content may be psychologically stimulating and keep children and teens awake far past the hour when they turn off their devices and try to sleep.

“Sleep is vital for children,” said Dr. Sujay Kansagra, director of the pediatric neurology sleep medicine program at Duke University Medical Center, who was not involved in the new analysis. “We know that sleep plays a crucial role in brain development, memory, self-regulation, attention, immune function, cardiovascular health and much more.”

Kansagra, author of “My Child Won’t Sleep,” noted that the period of greatest brain development is in our first three years of life, which corresponds to when we need and get the most sleep. “It’s hard to believe that this would be a coincidence.”

Kansagra said it’s possible that parents underreported kids using devices at night, but more likely, the technology is simply interfering with sleep hygiene. “For example, children who are allowed to keep devices in their room may be more likely to avoid a good sleep routine, which we know is helpful for sleep,” he said.

Practicing good sleep hygiene

Dr. Neil Kline, a representative of the American Sleep Association, agrees that sleep plays an integral role in a child’s healthy development, even though “we don’t know all of the science behind it. There is even some research which demonstrates an association between ADHD and some sleep disorders.”

In many respects, the findings of the new study are no surprise. “Sleep hygiene is being significantly impacted by technology, especially in the teen years,” said Kline, who bases his opinion not only on research but on his own “personal experience and also the anecdotes of many other sleep experts.”

Sleep hygiene – tips that help facilitate good, continuous and adequate sleep – include having a room that is quiet. “And that would mean removing items that interfere with sleep, including electronics, TV and even pets if they interfere with sleep,” Kline said.

One more important tip comes from the National Sleep Foundation, which recommends at least 30 minutes of “gadget-free transition time” before bedtime. Power down for better sleep.

Other recommendations for good sleep hygiene include not exercising (physically or mentally) too close to bedtime; establishing a regular sleep schedule; limiting exposure to light prior to sleep; avoiding stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine and nicotine in the hours before bedtime; and creating a dark, comfortable and peaceful sleep environment.",2025-11-14T17:22:55.865801

The US-imposed ceasefire of October 10 has not stopped Israel’s regular attacks on the Gaza Strip. Nor has it threatened to hold a parliament and society that largely cheered on the war, which has been deemed genocidal by multiple international bodies, accountable for their actions.

Instead, fuelled by what analysts from within Israel have described as an absolute sense of impunity, anti-Palestinian violence has intensified across the country and the occupied West Bank while much of the world continues to look away, convinced that the work of the ceasefire is done.

In the parliament, or Knesset, a senior lawmaker and member of the governing party openly defended convicted ultranationalist Meir Kahane, long considered beyond the pale even by members of Israel’s right wing and whose Kach movement has been banned as a “terrorist organisation”. At the same time, the parliament is debating reintroducing the death penalty, as well as expanding the terms of the offences for which it might apply – both unambiguously targeting Palestinians.

Under the legislation, proposed by ultranationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir – who himself has past “terrorism”-related convictions for his outspoken support of Kahane – anyone found guilty of killing Israelis because of “racist” motives and “with the aim of harming the State of Israel and the revival of the Jewish people in its land” would face execution.

That bill passed its first reading this week.

“The absence of any attempt to assert accountability from the outside, from Israel’s allies, echoes into Israel’s own Knesset,” analyst and former Israeli peace negotiator Daniel Levy said. “There’s no sense that Israel has done anything wrong or that anyone should be held to account.”

Even Israel’s media, traditionally cheerleaders of the country’s war on Gaza, has not proven exempt from the hardening of attitudes. Legislation is already under way to close Army Radio because it had been broadcasting what Defence Minister Israel Katz described as political content that could undermine the army, as well as extend what lawmakers have referred to as the so-called “Al Jazeera law”, allowing them to shutter any foreign media perceived as a threat to Israel’s national security.

“Israel has built up this energy through two years of genocide,” Orly Noy, editor of the Hebrew-language Local Call, told Al Jazeera. “That hasn’t gone anywhere.

“Just because there’s a ceasefire and the hostages are back, the racism, the supremacy and the unmasked violence didn’t just disappear. We’re seeing daily pogroms by soldiers and settlers in the West Bank. There are daily attacks on Palestinian bus drivers. It’s become dangerous to speak Arabic, not just within the ‘48, but anywhere,” she said, referring to Israel’s initial borders of 1948.

‘May your village burn’

In the West Bank, Israeli violence against Palestinians has reached unprecedented proportions. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), there were 264 attacks against Palestinians in the month the ceasefire was announced: the equivalent of eight attacks per day, the highest number since the agency first started tracking attacks in 2006.

Israel’s interior appears no less secure from the mob. On Tuesday, a meeting at a private house in Pardes Hanna near Haifa, hosted by Ayman Odeh, a Palestinian member of the Knesset, was surrounded and attacked by a mob of right-wing protesters. As police reportedly stood nearby, Israeli protesters surrounded the house, chanting “Terrorist! Terrorist!” and singing “May your village burn” in an attempt to interrupt the meeting, which was billed as a chance to build “partnership and peace” after “two years characterised mainly by pain and hostility”.

And in the Israeli Supreme Court on Monday, two of the soldiers accused of the brutal gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner at Sde Teiman prison last year were met, not by condemnation, but applause and chants of “We are all Unit 100”, referring to the military unit accused of raping the Palestinian man.

“They’re not cheering rapists, they’re cheering this idea that nothing matters any more,” Ori Goldberg, a political scientist based near Tel Aviv, said. “Genocide devalues everything. Once you’ve carried out a genocide, nothing matters any more. Not the lives of those you’ve killed and, by extension, not your own. Nothing carries any consequence. Not your actions, nothing. We’ve become hollow.”

Seeming to prove Goldberg’s point in the Knesset on Wednesday was Nissim Vaturi, the body’s deputy speaker and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing Likud party. Vaturi crossed one of Israel’s few political rubicons and directly referenced Kahane, whose name has become a rallying cry for settlers and ultranationalist groups across Israel.

Asked if he was in favour of “Jewish terror”, Vaturi replied “I support it. Believe me, Kahane was right in many ways where we were wrong, where the people of Israel were wrong,” he said, referencing the former lawmakers convicted of “terrorism” offences in both Israel and the US and whose party, Kach, remains a proscribed “terrorist group” across much of the world.

Speaking during the opening session of Tanzania’s new parliament on Friday, Hassan said she was “deeply saddened by the incident” and offered condolences to the families who lost loved ones in the crackdown.

“The government has taken the step of forming an inquiry commission to investigate what happened,” she added.

Her comments mark the first conciliatory message since Tanzanian authorities violently cracked down on widespread demonstrations following the country’s October 29 presidential election.

Hassan was declared the winner of the vote with nearly 98 percent support, after her leading rivals were barred from participating, fuelling anger and frustration among many Tanzanians who said the contest was unfair.

While the exact death toll is unclear, Tanzania’s main opposition party has said hundreds of people were killed as the government sent troops into the streets to disperse the protests. Authorities also imposed an internet blackout on the East African nation.

‘Grave human rights violations’

Rights groups have called for an independent and thorough investigation into what happened, with Amnesty International saying the authorities committed “grave human rights violations that include unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, unlawful detentions”.

“Authorities should promptly, thoroughly, independently, impartially, transparently and effectively investigate all killings by security agents and bring to justice in fair trials those suspected of being responsible,” the organisation said in a statement in early November.

The United Nations human rights chief, Volker Turk, also urged the Tanzanian government earlier this week to investigate the killings and other rights violations.

He called on the authorities to provide information about the whereabouts of people who have gone missing and to hand over the bodies of those killed.

Reports of families desperately searching everywhere for their loved ones, visiting one police station after another and one hospital after another are harrowing,” Turk said, adding that his office has been unable to verify casualty figures due to the security situation and internet shutdown.

Probe into youth ‘offences’

Meanwhile, dozens of people have been charged with treason and other offences in relation to the protests.

On Friday, President Hassan, who first took power in 2021 after the sudden death of her predecessor, John Magufuli, appeared to indicate there would be leniency.

“I realise that many youths who were arrested and charged with treason did not know what they were doing,” she said during her address in parliament.

“As the mother of this nation, I direct the law enforcement agencies and especially the office of the director of police to look at the level of offences committed by our youths.

“For those who seem to have followed the crowd and did not intend to commit a crime, let them erase their mistakes,” she added.

Hassan also acknowledged the demands of the opposition Chadema party, which has said, for any meaningful reconciliation to happen, constitutional reforms are needed. She said her administration would embark on a constitutional reform process within its first 100 days.",2025-11-14T17:22:59.348538

Hundreds of locals crowd onto the paved park grounds. Pockets of friends dance together, and children race around their parents’ legs.

They have come to hear one of the frontrunners in Chile's presidential race: Jeannette Jara.

A former labour minister, Jara is the nominee representing the leftist coalition in Sunday's election.

But it is her membership in the Communist Party that makes her presidential bid historic. Not since Chile's return to democracy in 1990 has a Communist candidate enjoyed such broad, mainstream support.

For some, Jara's success is a barometer for the economic malaise fuelling this year's election cycle. For others, her candidacy is a symptom of the growing polarisation within Chilean politics.

Jara has campaigned on the former, playing up her working-class roots. She has pledged to support Chile's public healthcare system, build affordable housing and raise wages.

“Considering that politics generates so much mistrust, being able to gather like this, with hard-working people, really fills my heart,"" Jara, 51, told the crowd in Villa Alemana, dressed in blue jeans and a loose-fitting blazer rolled up at the sleeves.

The United Nations’s top human rights body has ordered a probe into abuses in Sudan’s el-Fasher, where mass killings have been reported since the city fell to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) last month.

During a special session in Geneva on Friday, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution ordering the UN’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for Sudan to urgently investigate violations in el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state.

The resolution also called on the investigative team to “identify, where possible” suspected perpetrators in an effort to ensure they are “held accountable”.

The move comes weeks after the RSF, which has been battling the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for control of Sudan since April 2023, took full control of el-Fasher on October 26 after an 18-month siege on the city.

Nearly 100,000 people have fled el-Fasher since the RSF’s takeover, with displaced Sudanese civilians saying they faced indiscriminate attacks and sexual violence, among other abuses. Many said they saw dead bodies lining the streets.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk told the council on Friday that the “atrocities that are unfolding in el-Fasher were foreseen and preventable” and “constitute the gravest of crimes”.

He said the UN had warned that the fall of el-Fasher “would result in a bloodbath”.

“So none of us should be surprised by reports that since the RSF took control of el-Fasher, there have been mass killings of civilians, ethnically targeted executions, sexual violence including gang rape, abductions for ransom, widespread arbitrary detentions, attacks on health facilities, medical staff and humanitarian workers, and other appalling atrocities,” Turk said.

“The international community has a clear duty to act. There has been too much pretence and performance and too little action. It must stand up against these atrocities, a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population.”

Violence spreading

The RSF has denied targeting civilians or blocking aid, saying such activities are due to rogue actors.

But the UN, human rights groups and other observers have said evidence suggests that mass killings were committed by the paramilitary group.

Sudanese medics have also warned that the RSF appears to be trying to bury the bodies of those killed in el-Fasher in an effort to conceal what happened.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people are believed to remain trapped in the city, prompting the head of the UN’s migration agency this week to urgently call for a ceasefire and a humanitarian corridor to provide aid to those civilians.

During Friday’s Human Rights Council session, Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN’s independent fact-finding mission on Sudan, described examples of rape, killing and torture and said a comprehensive investigation is required to establish the full picture.

She said RSF forces had turned el-Fasher University, where thousands of civilians had been sheltering, “into a killing ground”.

Meanwhile, Turk warned that violence is “surging” to the neighbouring Kordofan region, where bombardments, blockades and forced displacement have been reported. “Kordofan must not suffer the same fate as Darfur,” he said.

The council, which is made up of 47 UN member countries, does not have the power to force countries or others to comply, but can shine a spotlight on rights violations and help document them for possible use in places like the International Criminal Court (ICC).

In early November, the ICC said it was “taking immediate steps regarding the alleged crimes in el-Fasher to preserve and collect relevant evidence for its use in future prosecutions” as part of an ongoing investigation into abuses committed in Darfur since April 2023.",2025-11-14T17:23:02.638518

Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged closer ties with Thailand during the first-ever visit to China by a reigning Thai monarch.

According to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, Xi on Friday described the two countries as “family”, and told the royals his country would “strengthen strategic alignment” with the Southeast Asian nation.

King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who has rarely made overseas state visits since he ascended the throne nine years ago, is in Beijing with his wife, Queen Suthida, for his first official visit to China.

Xi said cooperation would be expanded on a China-Thailand railway link as well as in emerging fields like artificial intelligence, aerospace and the digital economy.

“King Vajiralongkorn’s choice of China as his first major country for a state visit … fully demonstrates the high importance he attaches to China-Thailand relations,” Xi said, according to CCTV.

Vajiralongkorn described his country’s relationship with China as “brotherly cooperation” and expressed his desire to deepen exchanges in various areas.

The Thai royals were scheduled to visit a Buddhist temple and an aerospace development hub in Beijing, as well as attend a state banquet.

Thailand was a key ally of the United States during the Cold War, but China is the kingdom’s biggest trading partner and increasingly a source of military equipment.

The two countries have recently stepped up a joint crackdown on telecommunications fraud and illegal gambling gangs that operate in border areas, mostly in Myanmar, and often target Chinese nationals.

On Wednesday, Thailand extradited Chinese national She Zhijiang, who is allegedly linked to a lucrative scam hub in Myanmar. He had been in Thai custody since 2022.

China also pushed for a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia, a close partner of Beijing, after border clashes in the summer caused dozens of deaths.

That truce has proved fragile, with Thailand on Monday pausing its implementation after claiming a blast from a newly laid landmine had wounded four of its soldiers.

The two sides have subsequently traded accusations of further clashes along their border.",2025-11-14T17:23:04.142220

A deadly conflict between bears and humans is playing out across Japan, where authorities have deployed the military to protect locals who are using drone-based alert and surveillance systems to track the bears.

Since April this year, at least 13 people have been killed and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.

Japan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.

Both types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.

Shota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”

“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.

But why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?

Here’s what we know:

Where are the attacks happening?

According to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.

Earlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.

Bear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.

According to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.

In an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.

“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.

In an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.

He said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.

He held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.

The bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.

Attacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.

The surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.

In a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.

“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.

“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”

In late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.

Why are bear attacks on the rise?

Mochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.

“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.

According to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.

Mochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.

In 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.

Mochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.

“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.

How are the Japanese authorities managing the situation?

Last week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.

But while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.

“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.

“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.

So the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.

What are local people doing?

Residents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.

NHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.

What other measures can be taken to stop bear attacks?

Mochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.

“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”

He added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.

“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.

Mochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.

“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.

Last, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.

“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said.",2025-11-14T17:23:05.662051

In a stunning geopolitical reversal, on October 29, the United States abruptly lifted sanctions on Bosnian Serb leader and genocide denier Milorad Dodik – a known Kremlin ally who has long undermined Bosnia and Herzegovina’s sovereignty. The decision, which contradicts years of US policy, intriguingly coincides with the beginning of direct dealings between Russia and Bosnia’s Serb entity, Republika Srpska.

The Russians, who had long treated Belgrade as the only authority representing all Serbs across the region, have seriously undermined Serbia’s authority recently by acknowledging Dodik as the rightful representative of Bosnia’s Serb population.

The Trump administration’s unexpected move to lift sanctions on Dodik at a time when he is building a strategic relationship with Moscow signals a potential grand bargain between world powers, raising alarming questions about what Washington gained in exchange for effectively ceding half of Bosnia to Russia’s sphere of influence.

The unexplained reversal

The US unexpectedly removed sanctions from Dodik and his network. This was a sudden, unexplained reversal of a longstanding policy. For years, the US targeted him for trying to destabilise Bosnia, denying genocide, and pushing for secession. Removing him from the sanctions list appears to give a blessing to the denial of the Bosnian genocide and creates a clear path for Bosnia’s breakup.

This move creates a glaring paradox in US foreign policy.

Dodik is one of the Kremlin’s most overt allies in Europe, openly celebrating his ties with Moscow and advocating for Russian interests. However, the US keeps strong sanctions on many other people and entities for far weaker links to Russia.

The perplexing decision to lift sanctions on him exposes a troubling inconsistency in Washington’s approach to Russia, one that undermines the credibility of its broader sanctions regime.

Citing successful lobbying by Dodik as the reason for this reversal is a weak and unconvincing justification. According to estimates, Dodik’s lobbying efforts in the US have grown to two or three times the $30m figure confirmed for 2017. The scale of his spending, however, is still a pittance compared with the vast sums deployed by other nations and interest groups that consistently fail to achieve such spectacular diplomatic victories.

Another theory for the US policy shift involves Bosnia’s mineral wealth, specifically lithium. This follows a May 21, 2025, statement by Dodik, who publicly offered the mineral resources of the Bosnian Serb entity to the US in exchange for recognition of Republika Srpska’s sovereignty.

This theory, however, contains a logical flaw: if the US’s primary interest were lithium, maintaining sanctions would provide more direct control over the resources without needing to grant Dodik anything. The inadequacy of this explanation strongly suggests that more profound, undisclosed geopolitical calculations are at work, raising alarming questions about the true price of this sudden US retreat.

Moscow dominating Serbia

For a while now, Serbia has been moving away from Russia and towards the West.

On August 29, 2024, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced a $3bn deal with France to buy 12 Rafale jets, signalling Belgrade’s shift towards Western security alliances.

At a joint news conference, French President Emmanuel Macron praised the agreement as “historic”, lauding Serbia’s “strategic courage” and reaffirming its European future. This did not go unnoticed in Moscow. In May 2025, Russia accused Serbia of stabbing Moscow in the back for selling weapons to Ukraine. Furthermore, in July, the Kremlin condemned Belgrade for considering joining Western sanctions against Russia.

On the day before the sanctions on him were lifted, rather than courting Washington, Dodik was in Minsk embracing Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. By meeting Dodik a day before US sanctions on him were lifted, Moscow declared a new Balkan strategy that deliberately sidelines Serbia.

Back in September, Russia’s foreign minister described Dodik as the “legitimately elected president” of the Bosnian entity Republika Srpska. But now, the official website of Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs describes Dodik as “the leader of Bosnian Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina.” This new designation serves multiple strategic purposes and marks a clear geopolitical shift.

First, it undermines the sovereignty of Bosnia by asserting a national rather than a purely regional mandate for Dodik’s authority.

Second, it directly challenges Serbia’s ambition, embodied in the concept of Srpski svet (Serbian World), to act as the central patron of all Serbs, asserting instead Russia’s claim to be the ultimate arbiter of Serb political affairs. Belgrade’s Srpski svet mirrors the Kremlin’s Ruski mir (Russian World) doctrine, with both aiming to unite ethnic and linguistic kin under a transnational cultural identity. Ultimately, these ideologies serve to expand political influence and justify intervention in neighbouring states under the pretext of protecting their diasporas.

The most potent signal of this shift came from Dodik himself. He publicly snubbed Vucic by bluntly declaring that Belgrade would have no say in the Republika Srpska. Vucic responded by citing the affront: “The other night, I saw that in Banja Luka they say that no one from Belgrade will give them orders.”

For years, Serbia has positioned itself as the paternal guardian of all Serbs, with Republika Srpska operating firmly within its political orbit. Dodik’s statement shattered this dynamic, announcing that the Serb-majority entity now answers to a different patron.

Moscow’s move has publicly split Dodik and Vucic, weakening Serbia’s power. It shows Russia will now deal directly with Bosnian separatists, ignoring the Serbian government. For Vucic, who tries to keep ties with both Europe and Russia, this is a worst-case scenario. It proves his influence is no longer needed and that Russia is now working through Banja Luka instead of Belgrade, severely reducing Serbia’s importance.

Moscow’s power play: Annexing Europe’s ailing heart

The US decision to lift sanctions has effectively allowed Moscow to take in Republika Srpska as a new Russian territory. The era of indirect influence is over; the Bosnian entity is now being governed directly from the Kremlin, fundamentally altering the balance of power in Europe.

A Russian military footprint in the Balkans is also expanding. While Russia maintains unofficial bases in Serbia, it is now likely to establish one in Banja Luka, the de facto capital of the Bosnian Serb entity, as well.

Bosnia, located in the heart of Europe, is itself shaped like a heart. For 30 years, the European Union had the chance to heal Europe’s ailing heart. The EU failed because, at its own core, it is afflicted by deep-seated racism: Islamophobia and Russophobia. The price for this hatred is now clear. Half of Europe’s heart — half of Bosnia — has effectively become a new Russian territory, a territory from which launching missiles would be far more efficient than from Kaliningrad.

The global chessboard: A tacit US-Russia understanding?

The sudden lifting of US sanctions on Dodik, followed instantly by his strategic embrace with Lavrov, is best understood not as a US policy failure but as a calculated move on the global chessboard. Lavrov’s masterstroke was to publicly empower Dodik at the direct expense of Belgrade, a clear signal to Serbia that its historical role as the primary patron of Bosnian Serbs is over. In this new alignment, Moscow demonstrates that it holds the key to power in the Bosnian entity Republika Srpska, forcefully reminding Serbia who truly commands the loyalties of its supposed kin.

This power play exploits Serbia’s fundamental and precarious dilemma. The nation is perpetually torn between its economic and political ambitions for EU integration and its deep-seated historical, cultural, and religious ties to Russia. Lavrov’s move tightens the Russian noose, forcing Belgrade into a more subservient position.

This leads to the most unsettling theory: that the US acquiescence is part of a tacit great-power trade-off. The timing and incongruity of the sanctions lift suggest it is not a retreat but a strategic bargain. Washington may have deliberately ceded its influence in Bosnia, accepting an expanded Russian sphere of influence in the Balkans, in exchange for a strategic concession from Moscow elsewhere — perhaps related to Ukraine, the Middle East, or another arena. This fits a cynical historical pattern: big powers often ignore local commitments to serve their own secret deals.

The unanswered question and the fallout

The abrupt US sanction lift, followed immediately by Dodik’s pivot to Moscow, leaves one chilling, unanswered question: what did Washington secure in return for effectively gifting half of Bosnia to Russia’s sphere of influence? This opaque bargain sacrifices decades of principled Balkan policy for an undisclosed geopolitical price, undermining US credibility and the fragile Dayton peace.

The fallout is clear: emboldened secessionists, a destabilised Europe, and a dangerous signal that hard-won democratic norms are merely currency in a new great game, leaving allies betrayed and adversaries triumphant.

But on Wednesday morning, Streeting denied this, telling journalists that he was “not challenging the prime minister”.

In response to the ensuing media storm, Starmer, whose premiership since last year has been marred by poor polling, told reporters in north Wales on Thursday that briefings against ministers are “completely unacceptable”.

“I have been talking to my team today. I have been assured that no briefing against ministers was done from Number 10, but I have made it clear that I find it absolutely unacceptable,” he said.

The current internal party strife has shone a light on the prime minister’s standing as leader of the Labour Party.

In its most recent poll on Tuesday, pollster YouGov said of 4,989 people polled, only 27 percent thought he should continue as Labour Party leader.

Here’s what we know about the rumours of a leadership plot:

What are the rumours about a leadership challenge?

On Tuesday evening, unnamed senior Starmer aides told The Guardian newspaper that any attempt to remove the prime minister would be “reckless” and “dangerous”. According to the aides, deposing Starmer so early in his term as prime minister would undermine financial markets and reverberate on the stock market, the party and its international relationships.

“The party would not recover for a generation,” one of the unnamed sources told The Guardian.

Number 10 sources also told The Guardian they are concerned about rumours that Streeting could be planning a “coup” and is just one of several Labour ministers who are “on manoeuvres” to take the leadership if the opportunity arises. However, none of them were likely to move against the prime minister right now.

They said the most likely moment for a leadership challenge would be after the autumn budget – the government’s tax-and-spending review, due in parliament on November 26 – if higher taxes are announced, or after May elections next year if the Labour party performs poorly.

“Keir will not stand aside at this point, for Wes or anybody else,” one source told The Guardian.

On Friday, the UK’s Financial Times cited an unnamed minister who claimed that support for the health secretary was growing following the news of the unsanctioned “briefing”.

Streeting was not the only name mentioned as a potential leadership contender. Both Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and Energy Secretary and a former leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband were named as possible contenders, the sources said.

Politics professor Nicholas Allen, from Royal Holloway University in London, explained that the briefing revealed “genuine concern, at least in some quarters, that Starmer is vulnerable”.

Could a coup against Starmer be successful?

Allen said it would be difficult to achieve a new leadership election because Labour Party rules state that a contender have the support of 20 percent of MPs to be nominated. This would be hard to do with party whips, which enforce a party consensus.

“I don’t know how strong Streeting’s support is,” Allen said. “He probably couldn’t force Starmer out by himself; what would be more likely is a collapse in support within the party, fuelled by low poll ratings and unforced errors (like the briefing), and Starmer deciding to step down or being encouraged to go by a group of senior ministers. At that point, the field would be open. Streeting may or may not be the perceived saviour,” he said.

Who briefed the press?

The British press is speculating that the unofficial briefing may have been organised by Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, as a tactic designed to put off any ministers thinking about challenging him.

McSweeney, who has been widely credited with helping Starmer to win the July 2024 election, is now facing calls to resign from unnamed members of parliament, according to reports.

However, Starmer appeared not to support such a move on Thursday when he reiterated that he “of course” has complete confidence in his chief of staff.

What do opposition parties say?

Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch was quick to respond, accusing Starmer of losing control of his party during Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Question Time.

Badenoch called Starmer a “weak prime minister at war with his own cabinet”.

“Two weeks before the budget, isn’t it the case that this prime minister has lost control of government, he’s lost control of his party and lost the trust of the British people,” she said.

Earlier in the debate, Badenoch referred to an interview Streeting gave to the BBC in which he accused Downing Street of having a “toxic culture”, and asked Starmer if his minister was correct.

“Any attack on any member of my cabinet is completely unacceptable,” Starmer said in response.

Meanwhile, the far-right Reform UK party’s head of policy, Zia Yusuf, wrote on X on Thursday that the “terrifying thing about the coup against Starmer is that Labour members will choose his replacement”.

“Their favourite Labour minister is Ed Miliband. Some of the most unhinged people in the country will choose the next Prime Minister,” he added.

Reform’s popularity has risen hugely in the UK since last year’s election.

How does the autumn budget fit into this?

The briefing came just two weeks before Starmer and his chancellor of the exchequer, Rachel Reeves, announced the autumn budget on November 26.

The budget, which outlines the government’s tax-and-spending plans for the next year, has been the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks, as it was widely expected to break one of Labour’s main election pledges: not to increase income taxes.

However, the Financial Times reported on Friday morning that Reeves is now ruling out any rise in income tax amid concerns that it could seriously anger voters and backbench legislators.

Why else is Starmer losing popularity in the UK?

Since winning the election in 2024, the prime minister has received backlash from across the political spectrum, including from Labour voters, over several issues.

According to a YouGov poll in September, if an election were to be called now, the far-right Reform UK would win, leaving the Labour Party as the second-largest party and the former governing party, the Conservatives, in third place.

Allen said the briefing could damage public perception of the Labour party further as it has revealed “a desire by some to engage in tribal fights with senior ministers” and that Starmer “doesn’t do politics very well, either in terms of surrounding himself with reliable people (if he didn’t know) or in terms of political judgement (if he did authorise it)”.

“It merely confirms what most voters probably already think: that the current Labour government and its prime minister aren’t all that good, or at least not significantly better than the Conservative government they voted out less than 18 months ago,” Allen said.

Here are some of the main areas of domestic policy which are causing the popularity of Starmer’s Labour Party to wane.

Migration

The opposition Reform UK party has risen in popularity largely on the back of its calls for stricter migrant control. The key issue is the rapid rise in the numbers of people arriving in small boats across the English Channel from France, particularly in the past year.

In September, Starmer struck a “one-in-one-out” migrant exchange deal with France in an effort to deter people from attempting the Channel crossing. Under the deal, France will accept the return of asylum seekers who crossed to the UK but cannot prove a family connection to the UK.

For each migrant France takes back, the UK will grant asylum to one person who has arrived from France through official channels and who can prove they have family connections in the UK.

But only a handful of migrants have been deported under the scheme so far. Furthermore, on Monday, the Home Office reported that a second migrant had re-entered the UK after being deported to France.

Rise of the far-right

Starmer has faced criticism for his lukewarm response to the rising number of far-right protests across the country.

In September, at least 11,000 people joined a “Unite the Kingdom” march, displaying the St George flag in London.

While Starmer denounced violence against police officers during the protests and argued that the UK was “built on diversity”, the antifascist group, Hope Not Hate, and several MPs have urged the government to take stronger action against the rise of far-right groups.

Critics also say Starmer has not done enough to appeal to people who support Reform, or to address their concerns about migration.

Accidental prison releases

In a major blunder, HMP Wandsworth prison in London wrongly released two offenders in early November, including an Algerian sex offender.

Both men were eventually returned to prison but, in the case of the Algerian offender, only after the man handed himself in. Conservative Party shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick said the mistake revealed “the incompetence of this government”.

Economy

Starmer has been grappling with a low-growth economy since the start of his term in government.

According to new figures from the Office for National Statistics on Thursday, between July and September, the UK’s gross domestic product (GDP) increased by just 0.1 percent in comparison with growth of 0.3 percent between April and July.

Meanwhile, inflation remained stuck at 3.8 percent in September 2025 – unchanged from July and August. This is the highest it has been since the start of 2024.",2025-11-14T17:23:11.839926

On the morning of October 25, as Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces stormed the town of Bara in North Kordofan state, Sadiq Ahmed thought about his two daughters and what would happen to them if he couldn’t protect them.

RSF fighters began raiding homes, looking for loot, as well as women and girls, said Sadiq.

According to the United Nations and Human Rights Watch, the RSF routinely wields rape as a weapon of war and kidnaps women and girls to use as sex slaves.

When fighters came to Sadiq’s house, he gave them everything he owned: money, phones and gold. But he refused to give up his daughters or nieces.

“It was a red line for me. I was prepared to die to [protect my daughters],” Sadiq, 59, told Al Jazeera.

Sadiq was able to convince the RSF fighters – who are fighting the regular army known as the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) – to allow his family and his brother’s family to flee town.

They were among nearly 39,000 people uprooted from the vast Kordofan region due to a sharp uptick in violence between October 26 and November 9, according to the United Nations.

However, not everyone was so lucky. The Sudan’s Doctor’s Network said that at least 38 civilians were killed during the RSF’s capture of Bara, while other local monitors told Al Jazeera that men of fighting age were often accused of “sympathising” with the army and killed.

The next epicentre of conflict

Many of those displaced from Bara ended up with relatives or in open-air camps in North Kordofan’s capital, el-Obeid, a city about 59 kilometres (36 miles) east.

El-Obeid is controlled by the SAF, which has been at war with the RSF since April 2023.

The city is home to the SAF’s strategic airbase and operates as an important buffer to protect Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, according to analysts.

El-Obeid has also absorbed tens of thousands of displaced people seeking relative safety from the RSF, yet the city may not be safe for long.

The RSF is redeploying thousands of fighters to North Kordofan after capturing North Darfur’s capital el-Fasher last month, according to a leaked RSF document obtained by Darfur24, a local news outlet following developments in the region.

The nomadic “Arab” fighters that mostly make up the RSF’s ranks besieged el-Fasher for more than 500 days before carrying out a campaign of violence against sedentary “non-Arab” tribes, in what many observers have termed a genocide.

Relief workers, analysts and local monitors fear the RSF could subject civilians in el-Obeid to a similar fate.

“My forecast has always been that el-Obeid will be under [RSF] siege by Thanksgiving,” said Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the Yale Humanitarian Lab that provides satellite imagery analysis of the war in Sudan, referring to the holiday in the United States that falls on November 27 this year.

Raymond added that the RSF appears to be trying to first capture the town of Babanusa in West Kordofan, which it is currently besieging. That way, it can then use the town to support an all-out assault on el-Obeid.

The RSF will likely overburden SAF in Babanusa by launching its wide arsenal of drones from the airport in el-Fasher, Raymond explained.

“Babanusa is really the last line of defence [for the SAF] against the coming onslaught against el-Obeid,” he told Al Jazeera.

Looming battle

As the battlefield shifts to Kordofan, the SAF is reportedly stepping up recruitment and deploying thousands of newly recruited civilians turned fighters – known as the mobilised or “mustanfereen” – to el-Obeid.

SAF recently opened up a training camp in North Kordofan to recruit young men eager to fight against the RSF after the fall of el-Fasher, according to Mohamed el-Fatih, a Sudanese journalist and analyst covering developments across the country.

Fighters from SAF-aligned armed groups – known as the Joint Forces, which were instrumental in holding off the RSF in el-Fasher for a year and a half – are also present in el-Obeid, according to a local relief worker who requested anonymity due to the tense security environment.

He said that most civilians don’t leave their homes or displacement camps after sundown out of fear of being robbed by armed men on the street.

Other civilians are reportedly fleeing to neighbouring White Nile state, which connects to the only road out of el-Fasher, according to local monitors.

Hafiz Mohamed, the director of local human rights organisation Justice Africa, told Al Jazeera that more people are trying to get out before the RSF besieges the city.

“Some people are leaving … because they don’t have faith that el-Obeid won’t eventually fall. They don’t have confidence in the army,” he said.

Mohammed Ibrahim, a civil servant with the SAF-backed Port Sudan government who works for the economic ministry in el-Obeid, confirmed that civilians were very scared of an RSF attack after the group took el-Fasher.

Many people, he noted, were considering fleeing further north after a series of incriminating videos showed RSF fighters perpetrating mass killings and other atrocities in North Darfur.

“The SAF has sent reinforcements all around the city … and people are calmer now … everyone is ready to confront the RSF if they attack,” he said.

Outgunned and outmanned?

Despite the SAF’s recruitment drive to defend el-Obeid, it still lacks the arsenal and manpower to fortify el-Obeid, according to Raymond, the researcher from Yale.

He said the SAF typically relies on close air cover, either from warplanes or helicopters, to assist ground infantry. However, over the past year, the RSF has acquired man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS), which are a significant threat to low-flying aircraft.

The RSF has had MANPADS since at least 2024, and they have proven instrumental in combating SAF’s airpower.

“SAF has one play right now and that’s to curl up and prepare for siege mode … that’s because they no longer have [air supremacy], which was their biggest advantage,” Raymond told Al Jazeera.

Regional states backing the SAF, such as Turkiye and Egypt, could step up arms shipments to try and level the playing field.

The former is reported to have sold the SAF its highly regarded Bayraktar drones throughout the war – weapons that helped it recapture Gezira State and the capital Khartoum from the RSF earlier this year.

In addition, the SAF has recently requested access to Egypt’s air-defence systems to shoot down RSF drones.

However, Egypt is concerned about getting directly involved in the war, according to an Africa Intelligence report, which specialises in obtaining geopolitical and business intelligence.

Their analysis was based on open-source intelligence that tracked Egyptian and Turkish cargo flights to Port Sudan, as well as on defence sources, which claim to have intimate knowledge of the military planning of both countries.

Yet, even if the SAF acquires new upgraded weaponry from its allies, it still may not be enough to hold on to el-Obeid, said Raymond.

“These weapons are not a panacea,” he told Al Jazeera.

“The SAF still doesn’t have enough men bearing arms to control the vast area. They are running out of men,” he said.",2025-11-14T17:23:13.626594

Indonesia is readying up to 20,000 soldiers in preparation for a planned international stabilisation force (ISF) in Gaza, its defence minister has said, the makeup and powers of which have been a thorny subject of contention.

Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin told reporters on Friday that the soldiers were likely to focus on healthcare and construction-related tasks if sent to the Palestinian enclave ravaged by more than two years of Israel’s genocidal war.

“We are waiting for further decisions on Gaza peace action,” said Sjamsoeddin.

Under United States President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza, the ISF would be sent there to ensure a long-term truce.

Sjamsoeddin said Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto would discuss the Trump initiative with Jordan’s King Abdullah during the monarch’s state visit to the world’s most populous Muslim nation.

He did not detail how many soldiers would be sent or when they would be deployed, but noted that the decision rested with Prabowo.

Much uncertainty still surrounds Trump’s ISF idea, including its makeup and its remit.

Washington has said it has spoken to Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar about contributing to the force.

Israel has already said it will not accept Turkiye, a key Gaza ceasefire mediator, having any role on the ground.

Turkiye has maintained staunch criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza over the past two years and recently issued arrest warrants for genocide against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials.

Last week, the US mission to the United Nations formally circulated its draft resolution for negotiations.

According to a draft seen by the AFP news agency, it would give a two-year mandate to a transitional governance body in Gaza — known as the Board of Peace — that Trump would chair.

It would also permit member states to form a “temporary” ISF to secure humanitarian aid corridors and the border, and to help with the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”. Hamas has not promised to demilitarise, but it is a key tenet of the 20-point plan.

The ISF would also work with Israel, Egypt, and the newly trained Palestinian police to achieve its aims.

The US plan was dealt a blow when Russia presented the UN Security Council with a “counter-proposal”.

A spokesperson for the US mission to the UN said on Thursday that any “attempts to sow discord” around Washington’s resolution could have grave repercussions.

Should the October 10 ceasefire break down, it would have “grave, tangible and entirely avoidable consequences” for Palestinians living in Gaza, they added.

Speaking last week, Trump expressed hope that a US-coordinated ISF could be on the ground in Gaza “very soon”.",2025-11-14T17:23:15.127795

New Zealand’s former heavyweight world champion Joseph Parker failed a drug test on the day he fought the United Kingdom’s Fabio Wardley last month, manager Frank Warren’s Queensberry Promotions has confirmed.

British media had previously reported that the 33-year-old had tested positive for traces of cocaine and could face a lengthy ban from the sport.

“The Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) last night informed all required parties that Joseph Parker returned an adverse finding following an anti-doping test conducted on the 25th October in relation to his bout with Fabio Wardley,” Queensberry said in a statement on Friday.

“While the matter is investigated further, no additional comment will be made at this time.”

Wardley stopped fight-favourite Parker in the 11th round at London’s O2 Arena in the WBO “Interim” clash to earn the right to challenge Ukraine’s undisputed world champion Oleksandr Usyk.

The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), which would decide the length of any ban, could not be reached for comment on the next steps and the length of any potential ban.

The UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) would not comment, as is its standard practice.

Parker has not yet commented on his social media channels.

British boxer Liam Cameron was banned for four years after he tested positive for benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, in 2018.

Parker won the WBO heavyweight title in 2016 by defeating Mexican Andy Ruiz for the vacant belt. He lost the title to Anthony Joshua of the UK in 2018.

Pakistan has arrested four members of an Afghan cell over their alleged involvement in a deadly suicide bombing in its capital Islamabad earlier this week, as tensions heighten further between the neighbouring foes.

Tuesday’s attack outside a district court was claimed by a faction of the Pakistani Taliban, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Those arrested in connection with the bombing, which killed 12 people and wounded dozens, were linked to the Pakistan Taliban, according to Islamabad.

“The network was handled and guided at every step by the … high command based in Afghanistan,” a Pakistani government statement said on Friday, adding that the cell’s alleged commander and three other members were in custody.

“Investigations are continuing, and more revelations and arrests are expected,” it said, identifying the bomber as Usman alias Qari, a resident of Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan.

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told the Senate on Thursday that the bomber was Afghan.

Another one of the suspects, Sajid Ullah, told investigators that Saeed-ur-Rehman, a Pakistan Taliban commander, ordered the attack in Islamabad through the Telegram messaging app.

The commander, also known as Daadullah, sent Ullah photographs of the suicide bomber, an Afghanistan citizen, with orders to receive him after he crossed the border into Pakistan from Afghanistan, where he was a resident of Nangarhar province, the government said.

Daadullah, originally from Pakistan’s Bajaur region, is part of the Pakistan Taliban’s intelligence wing and currently hiding in Afghanistan, the government said.

The men were detained in a joint operation by the nation’s Intelligence Bureau and Counter-Terrorism Department, said the government, which did not detail where the arrests were made.

Islamabad has largely been spared from violence by armed groups in recent years, with the last suicide attack occurring in December 2022.

But the country is facing a resurgence of violence, which officials attribute mainly to armed groups allegedly sheltered on Afghan soil.

Naqvi on Monday claimed that Afghan nationals also took part in an assault this week on Cadet College Wana, a military-linked school in northwest Pakistan. Gunmen stormed the college and began a gun battle that lasted nearly 20 hours. Three soldiers and all the attackers were killed.

The Taliban government has not commented on Pakistan’s allegations, but has expressed “deep sorrow & condemnation” over both attacks.

Pakistan Taliban representatives did not comment on the arrests.

The accusations come amid a sharp deterioration in ties between Islamabad and Kabul, with recent attacks prompting the worst cross-border clashes in years last month.

More than 70 people were killed, including dozens of Afghan civilians, according to the United Nations.

The two countries agreed to a fragile ceasefire, but failed to finalise its details during several rounds of negotiations. Each side blamed the other for the impasse.

This week’s attacks now risk triggering renewed hostilities.

Addressing parliament on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif described the Islamabad bombing as a “horrific act of terrorism”.

“We want peace. We want Afghanistan to agree and be a partner in peace. We believe what’s good for Pakistan is good for them … but we cannot believe lies and not rein in terrorists,” he added.",2025-11-14T17:23:18.113588

“Tunisian authorities have increasingly escalated their crackdown on human rights defenders and independent non-governmental organizations (NGOs) through arbitrary arrests, detention, asset freezes, bank restrictions and court-ordered suspensions, all under the pretext of fighting ‘suspicious’ foreign funding and shielding ‘national interests’,” Amnesty International said in a statement on Friday.

Tunisia’s crackdown on civil society has reached an unprecedented level, according to Amnesty, as six NGO workers and human rights defenders from the Tunisian Council for Refugees are “being criminally prosecuted on charges solely related to their legitimate work supporting refugees and asylum seekers”. The trial’s opening session, initially scheduled for October 16, has been adjourned to November 24.

It is a long way from the heady days of the Arab Spring in 2011, when Tunisia appeared to be the only country to emerge relatively unscathed in the initial years that followed with a bona fide democracy in full flow.

A sweeping power grab in July 2021, when he dissolved parliament and expanded executive power so he could rule by decree, saw Saied jail many of his critics. That decree was later enshrined in a new constitution – ratified by a widely boycotted 2022 referendum – while media figures and lawyers critical of Saied have also been prosecuted and detained under a harsh “fake news” law enacted the same year.

‘Entire case has been a masquerade’

Within the past four months, Tunisia has temporarily suspended the activities of at least 14 Tunisian and international NGOs, said Amnesty, including the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women and the World Organisation against Torture.

Individuals have been similarly targeted.

Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Friday that Tunis’s Court of Appeal will hear on November 17 the appeal of more than 30 people “unjustly sentenced to heavy prison terms in a politically motivated ‘Conspiracy Case'” mass trial in April.

“Four of those detained are on hunger strike, including one who, according to his lawyers, was subjected to physical violence in prison on November 11.”

The defendants were charged with plotting to destabilise the country under various articles of Tunisia’s Penal Code and the 2015 Counterterrorism Law. Human Rights Watch, which reviewed the judicial documents, said the charges are unfounded and lack credible evidence. The NGO has called on the court to immediately overturn the convictions and ensure the release of all those detained.

“This entire case has been a masquerade, from the baseless accusations to a judicial process devoid of fair trial guarantees,” said Bassam Khawaja, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities should end this judicial farce, which is part of a wider crackdown on any form of criticism or dissent.”

The 37 people detained include opponents of Saied, lawyers, activists and researchers. Their prison terms range from four to 66 years for “conspiracy against state security” and terrorism offences.

Jawhar Ben Mbarek – cofounder of Tunisia’s main opposition alliance, the National Salvation Front – began a hunger strike on October 29 to protest his arbitrary detention.

Ben Mbarek was sentenced to 18 years behind bars on charges of “conspiracy against state security” and “belonging to a terrorist group”.

The leaders of Tunisia’s major opposition parties have gone on hunger strikes in solidarity with Ben Mbarek.

Among them is Issam Chebbi, leader of the centrist Republican Party, who is also being detained after being convicted in the April mass trial.

Rached Ghannouchi, the 84-year-old leader of the Ennahdha party, who is also serving a hefty prison sentence, announced he was joining the hunger protest.

Ghannouchi was convicted in July of “conspiring against state security”, adding to previous convictions, including money laundering, for which he has been sentenced to more than 20 years in prison and for which he claims innocence.

“Tunisia’s international partners should speak up against this flagrant injustice and assault on the rule of law,” Khawaja said. “They should urge Tunisian authorities to cease their crackdown, overturn these convictions, and guarantee fair trials.”",2025-11-14T17:23:19.607993

The election in India’s third-most populous state, with 74 million registered voters across 243 assembly constituencies, has been viewed as a key test of Modi’s popularity, especially among Gen Z: Bihar is India’s youngest state.

Vote counting concluded on Friday after two phases of voting on November 6 and November 11.

Here is more about the election results and what they mean.

What was the result of the Bihar election?

As of 5:30pm (1200 GMT) on Friday, the NDA had won two seats and was leading in 204 out of 243, while the opposition Mahagathabandhan, or the Grand Alliance, with the Indian National Congress and the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) as the main parties, was leading in just 33 seats, according to the Election Commission of India (ECI).

The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which is currently not part of either alliance, was leading in one seat. The All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), another party that does not belong in either major alliance, had won or was leading in the remaining five seats.

BJP and allies

Within the NDA, the BJP had won or was leading in 93 seats with a 20.5 percent overall vote share.

The regional Janata Dal (United) or JD(U), a key NDA constituent, had won or was leading in 83 seats, with 19 percent votes overall.

Another local NDA ally, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) or LJPRV, had won or was ahead in 19 seats.

The Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RSHTLKM) was leading in four seats.

The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), or HAMS, had won or was leading in five seats.

Opposition alliance

The Congress, India’s main opposition party, had won or was leading in five seats with 8.7 percent of the overall vote.

The Grand Alliance’s biggest party, RJD, had or was leading in 26 seats with 22.8 percent of the vote.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (Liberation), or CPI(ML)(L), was leading in one seat.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), was ahead in one seat.

How are Tejashwi Yadav and Maithili Thakur doing?

As votes were being counted, two of the most watched constituencies were Raghopur and Alinagar.

Raghopur has long been an RJD stronghold. But for some time during counting, Tejashwi Yadav, the son of RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav and the party’s de facto chief now, was trailing behind BJP candidate Satish Kumar in the Yadav family bastion. This had switched to a 13,000 vote lead for Yadav by 1200 GMT, with most votes counted. If Yadav were to still lose, it will be a historic defeat for what was, many years, the first family of Bihar. He previously won the seat in 2015 and 2020. His father has also won from Raghopur twice in the past, while his mother, Rabri Devi, has won it three times.

Popular folk singer, Maithili Thakur, representing the BJP, was leading in the Alinagar seat, with the RJD’s Binod Mishra trailing by 8,588 votes — another close contest.

What is driving the results?

Female voters

Political analysts attribute the gains for the key governing party in this election to the appeals Modi’s party has made to female voters.

In September, the BJP transferred about $880m to 7.5 million women – with 10,000 rupees ($112.70) paid directly into their bank accounts – under a seed investment programme called the Chief Minister’s Women Employment Scheme. Modi’s office said: “The assistance can be utilised in areas of the choice of the beneficiary, including agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, tailoring, weaving, and other small-scale enterprises.”

Women make up nearly half of all eligible voters in Bihar, where women’s political participation is on the rise. Female representation in the state has historically been low. But in 2006, Bihar reserved 50 percent of seats on local bodies for women, which has boosted their political representation.

Female voter turnout in the state has often surpassed that of men since 2010. The turnout among women this time was 71.6 percent, compared with 62.8 percent for men.

Voter ID checks

The opposition has also accused the ECI of deliberately revising the official voter list to benefit the BJP via a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls over the past few months. Registered voters were required to present documents proving they were Indian nationals and legal residents of the constituency in which they voted.

As Al Jazeera reported in July, however, many of the poorest people in Bihar do not hold any of the several documents that the ECI listed as proof of identity.

The opposition argues, therefore, that this new requirement could disenfranchise poor and vulnerable groups, including disadvantaged castes and Muslims, who typically vote for the RJD-Congress alliance.

In September, the ECI removed 4.7 million names from Bihar’s rolls, leaving 74.2 million voters. In Seemanchal, a Muslim-majority area, voter removals exceeded the state average.

What is the significance of these results?

Bihar is India’s third most populous state, home to 130 million people. It sends the fifth-highest number of legislators to parliament.

The latest vote has been viewed as a key popularity test for Modi, who was sworn in for his third premiership after he won the national elections in June 2024.

But the BJP failed to secure a majority in the national election on its own, forcing it to rely on regional allies such as the JD(U) to form the government.

Since the national election, the BJP has won most major state elections, and the streak seems to be continuing in Bihar.",2025-11-14T17:23:21.128624

Russian forces pressed into Ukraine’s eastern towns of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad during the past week as Kyiv’s military mounted a stout defence.

On Tuesday, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskii said almost half of the battles on a 1,200km (745-mile) front were happening in the two towns, claiming Russia has committed 150,000 troops – almost a quarter of its strength in Ukraine – to capturing them.

Russia sees Pokrovsk as a gateway to the remaining unoccupied parts of Donetsk, the region it has already claimed as its own in September 2022.

As Ukrainians were gripped by a corruption scandal involving President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s allies, the battlefront was in a fluid state in which no side seemed to gain a decisive advantage.

Both Russia and Ukraine often captured and recaptured neighbourhoods and individual buildings from each other.

Hus, a drone squad commander from the 68th Jaeger brigade on the outskirts of Pokrovsk, told the Reuters news agency, “Here, one building is held by our side, the next occupied by the enemy, and in a few hours it swaps.”

It did appear, however, that the Russians were slowly gaining ground.

Ukrainian troops told Reuters the defence of Pokrovsk was “steadily deteriorating”, despite the army’s efforts to reinforce it.

Russia’s Ministry of Defence said its troops were advancing through Pokrovsk in house-to-house battles.

A Ukrainian unit commander said Russia was leading its assault with Spetsnaz special forces who were looking for Ukrainian mortar firing crews and drone units, aiming to neutralise them and ease the passage of reinforcements.

These tactics had enabled the Russians to capture the centre of Pokrovsk by early November, and in the past week, they were attempting to work their way east and west. Ukrainian defenders appeared to be maintaining a stronghold in the north of Pokrovsk.

In Myrnohrad, to the east of Pokrovsk, Russian troops were infiltrating the eastern reaches of the town, and this week made a marginal advance into its northern edge, while Ukrainian defenders firmly held the bulk of it.

Both towns are precariously situated in a Russian encirclement from the north, south and east, in which supply and escape routes are only available towards the west.

The operational significance of the towns’ seizure by Russia depended on “whether Ukrainian forces conduct an orderly withdrawal or disorderly retreat” and on “Russian forces’ ability to exploit the collapse of the pocket and conduct a successful pursuit”, wrote the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank.

Russia’s Defence Ministry has repeatedly claimed that the towns’ complete envelopment and surrender with forces still inside was imminent.

Yet Ukraine has defied Russian expectations and fought on, engaging in what Syrskii called an “active defence”, using drones for “search and strike operations” that took a toll.

“Every metre of our land costs Russia hundreds of military lives,” Syrskii wrote on the Telegram messaging platform.

In October alone, Syrskii said, short-range drones had struck 77,000 targets, a 16 percent increase on the 66,500 targets he said had been struck in September, which in turn represented an 11 percent increase on August.

These figures suggested that Russian infiltrators’ efforts in smoking out drone units and cutting off Ukrainian resupply were meeting with less success than the Russian command might have hoped.

At the beginning of the week, Russia also stiffened its offensive near Huliaipole, about 60km (37 miles) southwest of Pokrovsk, on the border of the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions.

Syrskii said the situation had “significantly worsened” there, and that “exhausting battles” were taking place for Rivnopillia and Yablukove. Geolocated footage showed Ukraine was forced to abandon Rivnopillia on Tuesday.

On Saturday, Axios reported that the United States government shutdown may have delayed delivery of $5bn of weapons systems to NATO allies and Ukraine, though it did not draw a direct connection between this and the defence of Pokrovsk.

Russia kept up pressure on other parts of the front.

Its Defence Ministry claimed to have seized Uspenovka, Novoye and Sladkoye in Zaporizhia, Volchye in Dnipropetrovsk, and Gnatovke in Donetsk.

Ukraine’s deep strikes

Far from the ground war, Ukraine continued to pummel Russian refineries in a bid to cut off its fuel supply to the front.

Lukoil’s Volgograd refinery stopped operations on November 6 after being hit by Ukrainian drones, according to unnamed sources who spoke to Reuters. They said that the primary processing unit, representing a fifth of the plant’s total capability and other equipment was damaged.

On Saturday, Ukraine struck substations near Belgorod, causing a blackout in the city.

On Sunday, Ukraine caused a fire at the port and oil terminal of Tuapse, on the Black Sea. Russia said it destroyed four Ukrainian surface drones heading for the Tuapse oil terminal, which Ukraine has struck repeatedly in recent weeks, but others must have got through.

Ukraine also struck a power plant in Voronezh.

On Tuesday, the Saratov refinery caught fire after being attacked by drones. Explosions were also heard coming from the nearby refinery in Orsk.

“Russia has an air defence deficit, with losses including S-300, S-400, and many Pantsir [air defence] systems that protected facilities,” wrote the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko.

“Most of the enemy’s air defence is near the front and Moscow, creating significant gaps in Russia’s airspace. To understand, most Russians in the country are not protected by [President Vladimir] Putin at all, although he constantly promised security to everyone.”",2025-11-14T17:23:22.772899

But President Maduro has other options, say experts.

Venezuela on Tuesday announced what it called a major nationwide military deployment in response to the presence of growing United States naval forces off its coast.

On Thursday, the US also unveiled an operation, called Southern Spear, which it said was intended to target “narco-terrorists” in the Western Hemisphere.

The escalation has raised alarm in Caracas, where officials worry the US may be using these operations as a pretext to force President Nicolas Maduro out of power.

“We tell the American empire not to dare: We are prepared,” Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said on Thursday at an event in Caracas.

But is Venezuela really prepared for a US attack or invasion? What are its military capabilities? And what might be the calculus driving the decisions of US President Donald Trump and Maduro, respectively?

What has happened over the past few weeks?

Tensions between Washington and Caracas have been spiralling for weeks, as the Trump administration has hit a series of boats in the Caribbean Sea and, more recently, the Pacific Ocean, claiming they were carrying individuals smuggling narcotics into the US.

The 20th strike took place this week, US officials have said. In all, about 80 people have been killed. The Trump administration has not presented any evidence to back its assertion that the bombed boats had narcotics or drug smugglers on them, or that the vessels were even headed to the US. It has also not offered any legal justification for its actions, which many experts believe violate international law.

At the centre of Washington’s allegations is an unsubstantiated claim that Venezuela’s Maduro is driving the narcotics smuggling to the US in cahoots with cartels.

Meanwhile, the US has dispatched the USS Gerald R Ford carrier strike group into Caribbean and Latin American waters, a powerful naval formation built around the world’s most advanced and largest aircraft carrier.

An aircraft carrier is a floating airbase – a warship that can launch, land, refuel, and arm military aircraft at sea.

The Ford is a nuclear-powered supercarrier equipped with advanced technology, sailing alongside guided-missile destroyers and support ships, with more than 4,000 personnel and dozens of tactical aircraft ready for rapid deployment.

#Venezuela: I've often described the USS Gerald R. Ford in the media as a ""floating fortress of American power."" Some facts and figures showing why: pic.twitter.com/f53PeACIOB — Ryan Berg, PhD (@RyanBergPhD) November 12, 2025

As Washington expands its military presence in the region, analysts say the stated goals of the mission have broadened and may not fully align with the capabilities of the forces being deployed.

“The administration has said that the deployment is to stop the flow of illegal drugs to the US, and also to degrade the cartels, but over time the US goal has expanded to include anti-Maduro regime activities,” said Mark Cancian, senior adviser in the defence and security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in an analysis posted on X early on Friday.

Cancian noted that the carrier may not be fully optimised for the mission as described. “The Ford is not well suited for counter-drug operations… It’s well suited to attack adversaries either at sea or on land.”

He also pointed out that the deployment of the Ford cannot be indefinite.

“There are demands around the world for its presence because it’s such a powerful military asset, and eventually it’ll have to go home – so Southern Command will need to either use it or stand down,” he said, referring to the US military command under which the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean fall.

Is Venezuela prepared for an attack?

On Tuesday, Venezuela’s government announced a “massive” mobilisation of troops and civilians to prepare for any potential US action.

Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez announced a “higher phase” of the Independence Plan 200, a military response mechanism ordered in September to strengthen defence measures against the US presence in the Caribbean.

“Nearly 200,000 troops have been deployed throughout the national territory for this exercise,” Padrino Lopez added.

The exercise was scheduled to start Tuesday and end on Wednesday.

Padrino Lopez also stressed that the country’s military forces were united. He said “more than 90 percent of the people reject any aggression against Venezuela,” dismissing opposition groups he described as “minority, subversive, [and] fascist”, and claiming they “no longer exist” in the national political landscape.

He framed the mobilisation as part of a broader stand against “imperialist aggression” and Washington’s attempts to act as “the world’s hegemon” and “the world’s police”, insisting that Venezuela remains committed to its independence, liberty and sovereignty.

According to analysts, Venezuela’s armed forces indeed are – for the most part – closely tied, politically, economically, and institutionally to the movement known as Chavismo that has shaped the Venezuelan state for more than 20 years.

The military doctrine is based on policies laid out by the late Hugo Chavez, and it is based on members being “patriotic, popular and anti-imperialist”. Maduro took over as president after Chavez died in 2013.

“I don’t think that the Venezuelan government and the military are going to fracture only because of threats,” Elias Ferrer, founder of Orinoco Research and the lead editor of Venezuelan media organisation Guacamaya, told Al Jazeera.

“Because of the way they think in front of threats, they’ve always stuck together and strengthened their position,” he added.

What is Venezuela’s current military capability?

According to Global Firepower’s 2025 Military Strength Ranking, Venezuela places 50th worldwide out of 160 countries assessed in terms of military capabilities.

Within Latin America, it ranks seventh.

It falls behind regional militaries such as those of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, and sits in a similar range to Colombia, Chile, and Peru.

According to a report released by CSIS this week, Venezuela’s air force is small and only partially functional.

Roughly 30 of its 49 aircraft are believed to be operational, and only three F-16s can still fly, due to a lack of spare parts caused by US sanctions.

According to Military.com, a platform focused on the US military and veteran community, Venezuela has invested billions in Russian-made weapons systems, including missiles and fighter jets, intended to deter or challenge US ships and aircraft.

Venezuela has at least 21 operational Su-30s, a Russian fighter aircraft developed in the 1980s.

The Su-30s can be armed with supersonic antiship missiles, such as the Kh-31A, which are a significant threat to naval warships operating near Venezuela.

The CSIS report notes that in the event of a conflict, Venezuelan airfields and aircraft would likely be among the first US targets. The US has deployed F-35 stealth fighters to the region, and they are likely intended to counter both Venezuelan fighter-jet manoeuvres and the country’s air-defence systems.

On the ground, however, the analysis suggests that Venezuela maintains a significantly larger troop presence and greater firepower than the limited US forces currently positioned offshore.

According to Global Firepower, from a total population of 31 million, the Venezuelan military has an active military personnel of 337,000. Of them, 109,000 are active members, 220,000 belong to paramilitary forces, and the remaining 8,000 are reserve personnel.

But experts say these numbers mask a more troublesome reality for Venezuela: Its military forces have been hampered by years of limited warfighting training and a focus on internal security.

Its navy, meanwhile, is no match for the US and its uncontested control at sea.

Ultimately, analysts agree that the US is militarily far superior to Venezuela.

“No one can match the power of the United States military in conventional warfare,” Ferrer, the Orinoco Research founder, told Al Jazeera.

“What we need to think about in Venezuela is the capacity of the local armed forces to resist or to make the country ungovernable.

“They can make it so costly that it’s not worth it; that’s how you win in asymmetric warfare,” Ferrer added.

Is the US preparing to attack Venezuela?

Trump has justified the recent military buildup by arguing it is necessary to curb the flow of drugs into the US. But many analysts believe this is an effort to increase pressure on Nicolas Maduro.

The US president has said he does not plan to invade Venezuela, and Carlos Pina, a Venezuelan political scientist, believes Washington’s preferred strategy is indeed still political rather than military.

“I still believe that the main option for the US is not to carry out any armed attack, but to apply enough pressure for Nicolas Maduro to resign and hand over power peacefully,” he said. “In my opinion, that remains the most desirable option for the US.”

Pina argued that Maduro is fully aware of this strategy and is responding accordingly. “Maduro knows this, and because he knows it, he tries to raise the cost of any potential intervention,” Pina said. “He also counts on the fact that, both in the region and even within the country, a military invasion would likely not be well regarded or well received.”

However, Pina warned that the scale of the US deployment creates political pressure of its own in Washington.

“After sending so much military equipment to the Caribbean, it would be a political and diplomatic defeat for Trump to do nothing, to pull back and leave things as they were before the mobilisation,” he said.

Because of this, Pina said he expects the US to continue escalating rather than retreating. “Trump will probably do something to avoid that defeat,” he said. “He will likely keep increasing military pressure to force a political change, to initiate a transition. And as the days go by, he will continue building up more force-equipment, ships, planes, even troops in the Caribbean.”",2025-11-14T17:23:25.846036

A judge in the United Kingdom has ruled that global mining giant BHP Group is liable in Brazil’s worst environmental disaster, in a lawsuit the claimants’ lawyers previously valued at up to 36 billion pounds ($48bn).

High Court Justice Finola O’Farrell said on Friday that Australia-based BHP was responsible despite not owning the dam at the time.

A dam collapse 10 years ago unleashed tonnes of toxic waste into a major river, killing 19 people and devastating villages downstream.

Anglo-Australian BHP owns 50% of Samarco, the Brazilian company that operates the iron ore mine where the tailings dam ruptured on November 5, 2015. Enough mine waste to fill 13,000 Olympic-size swimming pools poured into the Doce River in southeastern Brazil.

Sludge from the burst dam destroyed the once-bustling village of Bento Rodrigues in Minas Gerais state, badly damaged other towns, left thousands homeless and flooded forests.

The disaster also killed 14 tonnes of freshwater fish and polluted 600km (370 miles) of the Doce River, according to a study by the University of Ulster in the UK. The river, which the Krenak Indigenous people revere as a deity, has yet to recover.

O’Farrell said in her ruling that continuing to raise the height of the dam when it was not safe to do so was the “direct and immediate cause” of the dam’s collapse, meaning BHP was liable under Brazilian law.

BHP said it would appeal against the ruling and continue to fight the lawsuit. BHP’s President Minerals Americas Brandon Craig said in a statement that 240,000 claimants in the London lawsuit “have already been paid compensation in Brazil”.

The case was filed in the UK because one of BHP’s two main legal entities was based in London at the time.

The trial began in October 2024, just days before Brazil’s federal government reached a multibillion-dollar settlement with the mining companies.

Under the agreement, Samarco – which is also half-owned by Brazilian mining giant Vale – agreed to pay 132 billion reais ($23bn) over 20 years. The payments were meant to compensate for human, environmental and infrastructure damage.

BHP had said the UK legal action was unnecessary because it duplicated matters covered by legal proceedings in Brazil.",2025-11-14T17:23:27.373068

There’s still a long road ahead.

Republican leaders aligned with President Donald Trump’s wishes by stalling Democrat-backed legislation to release the files. Trump, a onetime friend of Epstein, has faced persistent questions about what the files may show about the two men’s history.

Bill sponsors Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna used an arcane procedural tactic called a discharge petition to secure floor consideration. The move came over the objections of Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders. Johnson has argued that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s ongoing effort is sufficient. The committee has released tranches of emails and other documents related to Epstein, most recently on November 12, a release that included emails from Epstein that discussed Trump.

For weeks, the discharge effort was stuck at 217 votes – one short of the required 218 – but supporters reached the magic number on November 12 when newly elected Representative Adelita Grijalva was sworn in 50 days after being elected, the longest delay in recent history.

Grijalva signed the petition shortly after her swearing-in, making the discharge official. Massie and three other Republican members – Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina – joined all Democrats in signing it.

Though Johnson could have delayed it further, he said he would bring the measure for a vote the week of November 17.

Trump opposes further releases of Epstein material, writing on Truth Social November 12 that Republicans should focus only on opening up the government, which was still shut down because of a funding impasse. “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else,” his post said.

Here’s a guide to what happens next with this legislation and what’s at stake.

Who was Epstein?

Epstein hobnobbed with powerful people and received lenient treatment by the criminal justice system until the Miami Herald published an extensive investigation into his case in 2018.

In 2005, Palm Beach police began investigating Epstein after reports that a 14-year-old girl had been molested at his mansion. A grand jury indicted Epstein in 2006 on a single count of prostitution and he was arrested. The FBI launched an investigation and was prepared to bring an indictment, but in 2008 Epstein pleaded to one state count of soliciting prostitution and one state count of soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. He served about a year in jail, largely on work release.

The Miami Herald investigation found federal prosecutors and Epstein’s lawyers covered up the scope of Epstein’s crimes.

In July 2019, Epstein was arrested on federal charges for recruiting dozens of underage girls to his New York City mansion and Palm Beach estate from 2002 to 2005 to engage in sex acts for money. He was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019, and investigators concluded he died by suicide.

What are the Epstein files?

The Trump administration has given conflicting information about what’s in the Epstein files.

In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi released what she called the “first phase” of the declassified Epstein files, including flight logs, an evidence list and a redacted list of contacts. Bondi said the Justice Department would release more case files after redacting victims’ names.

When Fox News host John Roberts asked Bondi in February whether her department would release a list of Epstein’s clients, she said, “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review.”

But in a July memo, the Justice Department said there was “no incriminating ‘client list’”.

“There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions,” the memo said. “We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”

What would the legislation do?

The Massie-Khanna bill, titled the Epstein Files Transparency Act, requires that no later than 30 days after the bill’s enactment, the attorney general shall release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” held by the Justice Department, the FBI and federal prosecutors’ offices relating to Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sexual exploitation and abuse of minor girls over the course of a decade.

These materials would include flight logs and travel records related to Epstein, documents related to people and companies connected to Epstein, prosecution documents and internal Justice Department communications about Epstein-related cases and material related to his death in custody.

Under the legislation, documents containing victims’ identifiable information may be withheld or redacted. So would materials depicting child sex abuse, death or injury, or materials that would jeopardise an ongoing federal investigation, or prosecution or that would endanger national security. However, “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity” cannot be invoked to withhold material, the legislation says.

What are the bill’s prospects for House passage?

The steepest hurdle in the House was securing the 218th signature.

With that achieved, Khanna said he expects dozens more Republicans to vote for the bill than the four who signed on to the discharge petition, The Hill reported.

What happens if the bill passes the House?

If the legislation clears the House, it would head to the Senate. It would need 60 Senate votes to proceed to final consideration, meaning at least 13 Republicans would have to join all 47 Democrats and Democratic-aligned independents to advance. That’s a challenging obstacle.

“It is treated the same as any other bill, solely subject to the discretion of the majority leadership,” Donald Wolfensberger, a former staff director of the House Rules Committee, said.

In July, reporters asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune whether any Senate Republicans supported forcing more Epstein file disclosure. He said he was “not hearing” much desire within his conference to push the issue.

Thune said that when the House petition was still gathering signatures, and a successful House vote – especially with strong Republican support – could change that Senate calculus. But even if the Senate were to pass the legislation, the measure would face its stiffest test with Trump, who could veto the bill.

Overriding a presidential veto would require a two-thirds vote of both chambers, which would require substantial Republican support in opposition to their own party’s leader.

How much new material could come from the law’s enactment?

If the measure became law, Trump could still find ways to neuter its impact.

“The implementation of its provisions would still rely on Justice Department compliance,” a department that Trump has asserted significant control over, said Stanley Brand, a longtime Washington DC attorney who serves as distinguished fellow at Penn State Dickinson Law.

The Justice Department could argue to withhold certain documents, and resolving legal challenges to those decisions could put document releases at a standstill, Brand said.

“Complex questions of standing and federal court jurisdiction to entertain such a suit would undoubtedly stall resolution,” he said.

Dave Aronberg, a Democratic former state attorney of Palm Beach County, Florida, said he expects the Justice Department to have “wiggle room” with the exceptions included in the legislation.

Still, he said, it would “take a lot of creativity to withhold documents relating to President Trump”.",2025-11-14T17:23:28.871121

Some Palestinians who have lost a limb in Israel’s war on Gaza are creating homemade prosthetics to help themselves adjust to their new lives, due to the Israeli destruction of the territory’s medical facilities, their supplies, and the blocking of desperately needed equipment.

Since the conflict began in October 2023, 42,000 Palestinians have suffered life-altering injuries, with roughly 6,000 having an amputation or experiencing severe limb or spinal injuries.

Children account for a quarter of all amputations in Gaza over the past two years, making the besieged enclave the place in the world with the highest number of child amputees per capita, according to the International Rescue Committee.

One of them is Rateb Abu Qaliq, a nine-year-old boy who lost one of his legs after an Israeli attack on his house that killed his mother and brother.

“Before the amputation, I used to take part in many different sports,” he told Al Jazeera.

Speaking in the southern city of Khan Younis, his cousin Ahmed Abu Qalik recalled that Rateb fell over when he tried to kick a football after his operation.

“He walked away and started crying as he couldn’t play due to his amputated leg,” Ahmed said.

However, with an old piece of sewage pipe and a bit of string, Ahmed and his friends fashioned a prosthetic limb to allow him to join in again.

“Once, we went out to play and found a pipe that was longer than his leg,” Ahmed explained. “We cut the pipe to fit him and tied it with a rope so that he could easily join us in playing football and other activities. Now, he is happy and can do so many things.”

Few Palestinian children who have lost limbs have been evacuated for treatment outside Gaza.

In early September, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) reported that at least 21,000 Palestinian children had been disabled in Gaza since October 2023.

In total, more than 64,000 children have been killed or wounded in the enclave, the UN children’s agency UNICEF has estimated.

Like Rateb, father-of-four Ibrahim Abdel Nabi also lost a limb after being shot in the leg as he queued for food at a site run by GHF, a controversial Israeli and United States-backed aid debacle.

It led to the deaths and injuries of thousands of Palestinians, who were fired upon daily by Israeli soldiers and US contractors, as they desperately tried to access food for their families.

A month and a half after he was discharged from the hospital, Abdel Nabi said he and his wife decided to use a sewage pipe, some wire and nails to create a primitive prosthetic leg for him.

“The main purpose of this prosthetic limb is to restore my ability to move so that I can support my family and children,” he told Al Jazeera. “I love life and I am fighting to continue living it.”

UFC boss Dana White had to separate a tense staredown between welterweight title holder Jack Della Maddalena and Islam Makhachev before their fight this weekend, as the defending champ pledged to beat the mixed martial arts “legend” to bring the belt home to Australia.

The fighters came nose-to-nose and refused to break eye contact during a face-off after their news conference on Thursday at Madison Square Garden, New York, where they will headline UFC 322 on Saturday night, eventually leading White to prise them apart.

Della Maddalena (18-2) will mount his first title defence after beating Belal Muhammad by unanimous decision to become champion in May. The 29-year-old Australian is undefeated in the UFC and is now on an 18-fight win streak overall.

The 34-year-old Makhachev (27-1), who is regarded as a pound-for-pound great and is on a 15-win streak, vacated his lightweight belt to move up a weight class.

Della Maddalena was taciturn but appeared unfazed as he received a chorus of boos from the crowd at Thursday night’s news conference, with his Dagestani opponent the clear fan-favourite.

“This is what I got in this sport for – big challenges, big moments. I’m excited for the challenge and I’m looking forward to it,” Della Maddalena said.

“I’m going to bring this belt back home to Australia, no doubt,” he added.

“Obviously, Islam’s a legend. A big win over him would be a big name on the resume and it would definitely put me up on the pound-for-pound list.”

Makhachev said it was his “dream” to become a two-weight champion.

“I’m very close to my dream. All my professional career when I was lightweight champion, it’s my dream to become a double champion. Two more days,” he said.

Makhachev added that he would go 4-0 against Australian fighters – although he may have been lumping the New Zealander Dan Hooker in that list, as his only previous Aussie opponent was Alexander Volkanovski, who Makhachev beat twice.

“Australia, it’s a good place. I was there, I like it and now it’s 3-0, I will make it four,” he said.

Della Maddalena hit back by saying several Australian fighters were thriving in the UFC.

“I am very proud to be Australian, very proud to raise the Australian flag,” he said.

“Australia is very competitive, it has a fighting culture and that’s why we’re doing so well. We have two champions and after this weekend we will still have two champions.”

Although Della Maddalena and Makhachev are both well-rounded fighters, the Australian is renowned for his boxing while the Dagestani is famed for his ferocious ground game.

Makhachev smiled and said he “didn’t know” when asked if Della Maddalena was the best boxer in the UFC.

“Jack is one of the best, but I am also a good striker, so let’s see who is better,” he said.

Della Maddalena, meanwhile, told reporters he would “absolutely” be able to defend Makhachev’s takedown attempts for the entire fight, as he did so effectively in his victory over Muhammad.

“[I can do it for the] full 25 minutes,” he said, with a wry smile of his own.",2025-11-14T17:23:33.453829

Despite the ceasefire mandating the passage of humanitarian aid, only a fraction of that needed for the population has been let in by Israel.

The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has accused Israel of deliberately crippling its operations and blocking the entry of vital aid to Gaza amid its more than two-year genocidal war, as Palestinians face the onset of heavy rains and winter with sparse shelter or relief.

“Safeguarding UNRWA’s mandate and operations is required under international law; it is vital to the survival of millions of Palestinians; and it is essential for a political solution,” UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini told the UN General Assembly Fourth Committee on Thursday, citing recent findings by the UN Commission of Inquiry and rulings by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) obligating Israel to lift restrictions on the agency.

Lazzarini also told a news conference at the UN headquarters in New York that severe funding shortfalls were threatening UNRWA’s essential services, urging donor nations for more money, so that it could continue its operations in Gaza despite funding cuts by the United States.

“We run week by week, month by month. I know that as of today, we will be able to process our salaries in November, but have no idea if or no visibility if we will be able to process our salaries in December,” said Lazzarini.

Israel has barred UNRWA from operating on its soil after baselessly accusing some of its employees of participating in the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, which triggered the war.

Israel has repeatedly accused UNRWA employees of involvement in the October 7 attack without providing proof.

Following those allegations, the US – historically the agency’s biggest donor – suspended its support.

In the wake of Israel’s decision, UNRWA was forced to repatriate its international staff from Gaza and the occupied West Bank, limiting its food aid distribution abilities.

But it still employs 12,000 people in the Palestinian territory, and its services are vital to Palestinians, Lazzarini insisted.

“About 75,000 people were sheltered in 100 of our premises across the Gaza Strip,” he said.

“We have, over the last two years, provided more than 15 million primary health consultations. Today, the average is about 14,000 a day,” he added, also noting the agency’s joint vaccination campaign with UNICEF and the World Health Organization. UNRWA also provides education for tens of thousands of children.

“In the absence of a significant influx of new funding, the delivery of critical services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region will be compromised,” Lazzarini added.

While US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said UNRWA will have no role in post-war Gaza, in sync with Israeli demands, Lazzarini noted that since the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took hold, “we have expanded our services”.

‘Terrifying nightmare for a lot of families’

Under the ceasefire, which took effect on October 10, and which Israel has violated hundreds of times, aid deliveries were supposed to be significantly ramped up, with at least 600 trucks a day due to enter Gaza to fulfil the population’s needs.

However, only “around 150 trucks” have been entering Gaza daily, carrying supplies that are not sufficient for the “two million Palestinians that are currently displaced and homeless”, said Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza.

“There are a lot of Palestinian families who have said that there are no tarps, no tents, and they didn’t receive any humanitarian aid”, despite the arrival of the aid trucks, said Khoudary.

The lack of supplies, coupled with the onset of winter, is a “terrifying nightmare for a lot of families and especially for those who are living in makeshift camps”, said Khoudary.

The lack of supplies has prompted the UN to warn that the hunger crisis in Gaza remains catastrophic, particularly in the north, where famine was declared in August, due to the slow and difficult route aid convoys face from the south.

Trucks carrying humanitarian aid and commercial cargo resumed passage through the northern Zikim border crossing earlier this week.

Israel had closed the crossing, the main entry point into the hard-hit northern Gaza Strip, for two months, with its reopening welcomed by Palestinians and UN aid agencies.

Palestinian truck driver Abdulkarim Abu Daqqa said on Thursday that they had loaded approximately 80 trucks and hoped that the crossings would continue the following day to alleviate Gaza’s humanitarian crisis.

A spokesperson for COGAT, the Israeli Defence Ministry body that oversees civilian affairs in the occupied Palestinian territory, told the AFP news agency that the crossing would remain open permanently.

Exchange of bodies

The October ceasefire also provided for the release of captives and prisoners held by Israel and Hamas.

Israel on Thursday received the body of one of the last four captives held by Hamas from the Red Cross, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said.

The coffin was handed over in the Gaza Strip to the Israeli army and Shin Bet security service, the office said.

It later said forensic experts had confirmed the body was that of Israeli captive Meny Godard, 73, who was killed in the Hamas-led October 2023 attack on southern Israel.

Hamas said the body was found in Khan Younis in the south of the territory.

The search for the remaining three bodies is going to be “complicated” and “will take time”, said Khoudary.

According to an announcement by Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, they require “more tools, more equipment … more technicians” as the location where the bodies are located is “very unreachable”, Khoudary added.

The remaining bodies are located beyond the so-called Yellow Line, according to Khoudary, which are “dangerous areas”.

The Yellow Line is a boundary dividing the Gaza Strip into Israeli-occupied and Hamas-controlled zones, established as part of the October ceasefire. Israel has been routinely firing at and killing Palestinians venturing to check on the ruins of their homes in areas it controls in recent weeks.

Palestinians are eagerly waiting for the three remaining bodies to be handed over to the Israeli authorities, “because their lives are on hold. Palestinians want reconstruction, they want to know from where they could start their lives all over,” said Khoudary. “There are a lot of Palestinians who need medical evacuations, and these won’t happen until the three bodies” have been delivered to Israel via the Red Cross.

At the start of the truce, Hamas held 20 living captives and 28 bodies of the deceased.

In exchange, Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in its custody and returned the bodies of hundreds of deceased Palestinians.

Gaza’s health officials have said many of the returned bodies showed signs of torture, mutilation and execution.

Gaza health officials said on Friday they had received the bodies of 15 Palestinians returned by Israel. Their remains were delivered to Nasser Medical Complex, according to an Al Jazeera correspondent. This brings the total number of bodies recovered through the deal to 330.

“Identifying these bodies [of Palestinians] has been very challenging,” said Khoudary.

Only a small number of them have managed to be identified, said Khoudary, as they have “decomposed, [been] disfigured”. As a result, “it’s very hard for families to identify who these Palestinians are, so that’s why most of those Palestinians are buried without identification in one of the mass graves in Deir el-Balah.”",2025-11-14T17:23:34.971578

Speaking after garlanding the statue of Nehru on the Vidhana Soudha premises here on Friday on the occasion of Nehru’s birth anniversary, the Chief Minister said: “The BJP had no role in the freedom struggle. The only aim of the BJP is to criticise Nehru and Gandhiji, who struggled for independence. They have made it their occupation to criticise the two and make unfounded allegations against them.”

Earlier, speaking at the Children’s Day celebrations and State-level Parents-Teachers convention, organised by the Department of Education and Literacy, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that those who sided with the British during the freedom struggle are the ones who are criticising Nehru and Gandhiji. “Parents and children should understand the contribution of Nehru to freedom struggle and to science, irrigation, technology and agriculture sector, among others.”

The Chief Minister said that the country’s future will be decided by the children who develop rationality and scientific temper. “Children should stay away from superstition and blind belief from their primary school education. Caste-based discrimination should be shunned. Everyone should practice tolerance and co-existence to ensure unity in diversity that is enshrined in the Constitution,” he added.

He said that the first Prime Minister believed that children formed the basis of modern India, and that he gave impetus to education that inculcated scientific temper among children. “Our government has allocated ₹65,000 crore to the education sector. All children who were felicitated today belong to poor families. Education does not belong to any one. Even I became Chief Minister after having studied in a government school.”",2025-11-14T17:23:36.722201

Mr. Kumar’s Mahila Rozgar Yojna, under which ₹10,000 was given to around 1.25 crore women over the last two months, seemed to have played an important role in his victory.

As of 9:30 p.m. on Friday evening, the NDA’s total vote share stood at 44%, while the Opposition INDIA bloc had a vote share of almost 36%. In terms of seats, the gap is much wider. The NDA had won 192 seats and was leading in another 10 constituencies. The Opposition mahagathbandhan is facing total collapse, having won just 33 seats and leading in another two seats.

BJP is single largest party

In fact, the Opposition’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has the highest vote share among all parties, winning nearly 23% of votes polled, but that has translated to a likely tally of just 25 seats, as it has won 24 constituencies and is leading in one. The BJP had the next best vote share of 20%, and is set to have the most legislators in the Assembly, having won 87 seats and leading in two more. Its NDA ally, the Janata Dal (United) has garnered a 19.26% vote share, and has won 78 seats and is leading in seven more. Both the BJP and JD(U) had contested 101 seats each.

The Congress is set to post its worst performance since 2010, snagging just six seats, despite a vote share of 8.7%. The NDA’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) has a vote share of just under 5%, but has won 18 seats and is leading in one. The remaining parties received less than 2% of the vote each, including the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi with a 1.8% vote share, which has won five seats.

Apart from the BJP and JD(U), the NDA’s smaller members contributed significantly to the coalition’s tally. The LJP(RV), led by Union Minister Chirag Paswan, posted an excellent strike rate, likely to win 19 of the 29 seats it had contested. More importantly, 17 of these seats had been won by the mahagathbandhan in the 2020 election, cementing Mr. Paswan’s importance in the ruling alliance. The Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) led by Upendra Kushwaha won four seats, while the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by Union Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi won five.

‘NDA’s complete unity’

Heading towards a landslide victory, Mr. Kumar posted a message on X saying, “The people of the State have expressed their confidence in our government by giving us a massive majority.” He added: “The NDA alliance has achieved a massive majority in this election by demonstrating complete unity. For this massive victory, thanks to all the partners of the NDA alliance leaders. With the support of all of you, Bihar will progress even further and will be included in the category of the most developed states in the country.”

The NDA victory comes amidst potential headwinds from anti-incumbency, allegations of vote theft levelled by the Congress, and new entrants like Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party (JPS), which failed to win even a single seat in its electoral debut.

Mr. Kumar’s decision to more than double the State’s pension for the elderly, disabled people, and widows from ₹400 to ₹1,100 played a major role, along with the 125 units of electricity given free to every consumer. In an election where women voters outnumbered men, however, it is the ₹10,000 paid out to around 1.25 crore women in the last two months before the election that seems to have been pivotal.

‘Opposition arrogance’

Mr. Paswan lashed out at the “arrogance” of the Opposition. “On one side, the entire Bihar is witnessing the unified strength of the NDA, while on the other side, behold the arrogance of the RJD—the mandate has not even fully come yet, and they were talking about taking oath on November 18. This is what happens when ambition turns into ego,” he said.

The Opposition’s Chief Ministerial face and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav did not issue any statement. His mahagathbandhan ally, the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahni said, “There is no problem right now. Those who won deserve the congratulations. We will review everything in the coming days and return to the people. The cash scheme of the government worked in the favour of NDA.”

Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathore said, ”We will certainly review the unexpected results of the Bihar Assembly elections. While we respect the mandate of the people of Bihar, we assure them that we will continue to fight strongly on public issues and raise their voices for their rights.”",2025-11-14T17:23:38.237458

The posthumous ruling came a year after 48-year-old Andrei Kotov was found dead in his cell in a Moscow pre-trial detention centre.

Russia has heavily targeted the LGBTQ community under President Vladimir Putin, and Friday's ruling against somebody who had died a year earlier is seen as a particularly symbolic example of how zealous the crackdown is.

Kotov, who ran a travel company called Men Travel, had said he was beaten by 15 men when he was arrested in November 2024.

The Moscow Golovinsky court found him guilty of taking part in ""extremist activity"" as well as using underage people for pornography, the independent Mediazona website reported from inside the court.

His lawyer had said in December 2024 that Kotov's body was found in his cell and that investigators told her he died by suicide.

Rights groups have accused authorities of using the case as a show trial, not dropping it after his death to scare LGBTQ people.

In November 2024, Kotov described his arrest in court: ""Fifteen people came to me at night, beat me, were punching me in the face.""

Mr. Putin has for years denounced anything that goes against what he calls ""traditional family values"" as un-Russian and influenced by the West.

In 2023, Russia's Supreme Court banned what it called the ""international social LGBT movement"" as an ""extremist organisation"".

Human Rights Watch has said that the ruling ""opened the floodgates for arbitrary prosecutions of individuals who are LGBT or perceived to be, along with anyone who defends their rights or expresses solidarity with them"".

Russia has never been a hospitable environment for LGBTQ people, but has become far more dangerous since Moscow's Ukraine offensive, which massively accelerated the country's hardline conservative turn.",2025-11-14T17:23:41.670047

Mr. Pandian faulted the State Government for having moved against the Karnataka government in the Supreme Court rather than taking on the Jal Sakthi Ministry, Cauvery Water Regulation Committee, and Cauvery Water Management Authority for having accepted the dam proposal from the upper riparian State.

Mr. Pandian cited the apex court’s earlier stand that the verdict of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal on the share of water for Tamil Nadu could not be appealed against and would be deemed final. This has been published in the Central Government Gazette.

“The water-sharing formula specified by the Tribunal is already a settled issue between the two States. With this being the case, Karnataka has no right to construct any new dam. The Chief Minister, rather than the Water Resources Minister, has to respond to Karnataka on the issue to gain National-level visibility,” Mr. Pandian contended. The State government has to appeal against the Supreme Court’s remark that Tamil Nadu’s challenge against the Central Water Commission’s directive to prepare the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the project was “premature”.

He warned that acquiescing to Karnataka’s plan would cause desertification of 28 lakh acres in Tamil Nadu, and block water availability for 22 districts.

The draft will introduce a stricter zone-based system, and standardise how rights are assigned to bidders for every road, circle and notified stretch.

In the revised draft, the government has allowed more advertising space on most Bengaluru roads. Earlier, rules had fixed lower limits—for example, 800 sq. ft of ads were allowed for every 200 m on 18 to 24 m roads, 1,000 sq. ft on 24–30 m roads, 1,100 sq. ft on 30–60 m roads and 1,200 sq. ft on the widest roads. The new draft increases these to 1,000 sq. ft, 1,200 sq. ft, 1,500 sq. ft and 1,600 sq. ft respectively. A major earlier restriction, a cap on how long the ads could be horizontally, has now been completely removed. The new draft does away with previous layout restrictions that controlled how ads could be arranged.

The new draft also revises how much advertisers must pay per sq. ft. Earlier, low-value stretches started at ₹50 per sq. ft (for ₹3000 per sq. ft.) and the rates climbed up to ₹90 (₹40000 per sq. ft.) for the highest-value areas. In the new draft, the starting band now begins at ₹45 (₹4000 per sq. ft), and the highest band tops out at ₹75 (₹25000 per sq. ft).

The draft retains the basic rule that the bidder who wins rights for any road stretch, circle or area can put up advertisements anywhere within that zone on behalf of clients. However, the rules governing private properties have been rewritten. Previously, the erstwhile BBMP bylaws imposed steep penalties on B-Register properties and sites without Khata, including double additional property tax, and in some cases full property tax plus double penalty until a Khata was obtained.

The new draft removes these clauses and said that no commercial advertisement can be put up on any property that does not have a valid Khata, unless the owner first converts it to an A-Khata in accordance with the law. The corporation will continue to have the power to immediately remove hoardings on properties without Khata or those missing from the property-tax register.

The rules also clarify that paying advertisement fees to the corporation does not give advertisers any right to enter or use private or government property on their own, permissions and commercial terms must be independently negotiated with each property owner. These payments to property owners are separate from the advertisement fees owed to the corporation.

The draft also redefines how advertisements inside government-owned premises will be handled. Earlier, railways, BMRCL, KSRTC, BMTC, and PSUs retained revenue from ads inside their campuses, and certain metro-related revenues were shared between BBMP and BMRCL. The new draft continues to let these agencies tender and retain income from advertisements inside their facilities, but removes the cross-sharing arrangements. Metro pillars, stations and all other BMRCL structures remain fully outside the bidder’s rights even if they fall within the bidder’s assigned stretch, and BMRCL will tender these separately.",2025-11-14T17:23:47.664526

The daughter-in-law survived the attack, while the mother of the accused, who had intervened to protect the couple was also hacked to death.

The verdict was pronounced by Judge V.R. Latha late Friday evening, as the accused man Dandapani stood with folded arms.

The victim D. Subhash, from a most backward community and his wife Anusuya (25), from Adidravidar caste, had been married barely for 20 days on April 15, 2023, when their life was upended.

Subhash and Anusuya’s family were neighbours and friends in Tiruppur. Anusuya, a MSc Chemistry graduate, was working in a garments company in Tirupur, while Subhash’s father was a tailor. Anusuya was also a close friend of Subhash’s sister, and the two families were neighbours and friends, who had comingled.

Subhash, an MBA graduate, was living with his grandmother in Uthangarai in Krishnagiri. The duo got familiar with each during his visits to meet his family in Tiruppur and fell in love. In early 2023, Anusuya’s parents started to look prospective grooms for her, when Subhash informed his family of their relationship.

While the women of Subhash’s family knew of her caste, the accused Dandapani was unaware until that time. He had objected to their relationship. Subhash went ahead and married Anusya on March 27, 2023. The couple had temporarily moved base to the neighbouring Thirupathur district.

Dandapani had asked his mother Kannammal (65), who had raised Subhash, to invite the couple to her home on April 14, Tamil New Year’s day, promising rapprochement. Subhash and Anusuya arrived at his grandmother’s house on April 14. That night, the couple had slept inside the house, while Kannammal and Dandapani, who reached Uthangarai that evening slept outside the house. Just before dawn, at about 5 a.m., Dandapani went into the house and hammered his sleeping son to death.

He grabbed Anusuya and attacked her with a sickle, while Kannammal, who had woken up, and intervened to stop Dandapani from his murderous spree sustained grievous injuries and died on the spot. Anusaya had pretended to be dead to survive the attacker, who had returned twice to check her breath. The second time, Dandapani fixed her dishevelled clothes before leaving the crime scene. Later, she had dragged herself through a graveyard, before someone found her. She was rescued and taken to Uthangarai government hospital and later to Dharmapuri and Salem government hospitals.

The accused Dandapani had fled and was arrested near Theerthamalai, near Harur, in Dharmapuri, where he had attempted to slit his throat.

On Friday, Judge Latha sentenced Dandapani to triple life sentences for the two murders each and one under the Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. He was also sentenced to 10-year term under Section 307 of the IPC( Attempt to murder). The accused was also slapped fines of ₹8,000 and all the sentences will be served concurrently.",2025-11-14T17:23:49.220354

She had witnessed the brutal killing of her husband, survived a murderous attack that had almost severed her limbs. Ms. Anusuya had since rebuilt her life with the support of the Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front (TNUEF) and her family consisting of a mother and younger brother.

Ms. Anusuya underwent nine plastic surgeries, multiple surgeries to her head and neck; studied B.Ed with the help of TNUEF, and has stood her ground through each hearing of the trial. “The first thing she asked us when we reached out was that she wanted to study B.Ed. We admitted her in Annamalai University, says P. Suganthi, general secretary of TNUEF. “The only time she didn’t attend classes was when she was undergoing surgeries.”

Two months ago, Anusuya did receive a string of text messages from her former friend and Subhash’s sister, pleading with her to save Subhash’s father by backing off from her testimonies. “I wasn’t fighting for justice just for me, but for Subhash and his grandmother. “I wanted to live with him, but that did not happen. Today, on the day of the verdict, I asked Subhash to be with me, to be my support.”

“Had it not been for TNUEF, comrades Samuvel Raj, Suganthi, Mohana, Valentina, my mother and brother and countless others, I would not have known what to do,” said Ms. Anusuya

Ms. Anusuya chose to stay away from the court complex and instead waited at the CPI (M)’s office. She hugged Ms. Suganthi, as she entered and wept inconsolably.

Historic verdict

“This is a historic verdict,” said P. Suganthi, general secretary of TNUEF, that led the fight for justice, by first reaching out to her at the Salem Government Medical College Hospital, where she underwent prolonged treatment.

“We had met the District Collector twice at that time asking for a job for Ms. Anusuya. But, since victim Subhash was not a Dalit, the SC/ST (POA) Act that orders a government job, a house and rehabilitation measures would not apply to Ms. Anusuya. That is why we demand a Special Act to deal with ‘honour’ killing, where cases like Ms. Anusuya, a Dalit, who survives an attack cannot go uncovered,” she said.",2025-11-14T17:23:50.670706

Its reach as a cultural movement soon spread in the fields of literature, performing arts and education as well as spiritual learning. The Bangalore Kendra of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan began in 1965, and the chapter commenced their diamond jubilee celebrations with Santhavani.

Santhavani was inaugurated by film director TS Nagabharana and columnist Narahalli Balasubramanya, with devotional films in different languages and a book exhibition. As part of their diamond jubilee celebrations as many as 60 programmes have been planned for the following year.

The devotional film festival, which concluded on November 14, will be followed by Santhavani’s Segment Two with lectures, music, dance, drama, choirs and panel discussions scheduled from November 15 to 21.

“Our founder Munshiji, whom we refer to as Kulapati, chose the name Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan because he envisioned it as an institution without boundaries of geography, caste, religion, politics or language,” says KG Raghavan, chairman, Bhavans, Bangalore Kendra. “That is why it is called Bharatiya Vidya (Indian education). In keeping with this, he chose a tagline from the Rig Veda, that translates to let noble thoughts come to us from every side.”

Munshi was a prominent freedom fighter, lawyer, politician and prolific writer. He was on the committee which drafted the Indian Constitution, and served as the Governor of Uttar Pradesh. “India required an institution to foster value-based education and culture that would share ‘vidya’ or knowledge without barrier; Munshi’s passion sowed the seeds for Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan,” Raghavan says.

Talking about Bhavan’s e-book, The History and Culture of Indian People, Raghavan says, “Munshi was a visionary who undertook this mammoth project. Comprising 11-volumes, it took as many as 100 reputed historians nearly 32 years to write and compile it, labouring from 1944 to 1976. It contains nearly 10,000 pages of the nation’s history makers and their accomplishments.”

Later, the Kannada version of the book was undertaken by 60 translators under an advisory committee headed by AV Narasimha Murthy.

Dispelling darkness

The ongoing 60th special was curated by the Bhavans team in Bengaluru to integrate knowledge, wisdom and culture in an effort to bring light to areas of ignorance. HN Suresh, director, Bhavans Bangalore Kendra, says, “Today, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has 365 centres in India and 10 centres abroad. We publish thousands of books aside from the ones by Munshi who wrote 150 titles in English, Gujarati and Hindi, and publications in regional languages.”

Suresh goes on to say, value-based education is imparted in 165 Bhavans-affiliated schools across India. “Our association with the Infosys Foundation sees regular cultural programmes throughout the nation.”

Bhavans has brought out a special booklet with messages of hope and appreciation by world leaders and cultural icons who have been associated with the institution. Among them is His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who has said,”Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan makes a special effort to foster religious harmony with an emphasis on sarva dharma samabhav or equal respect for all religions, which I too, wholeheartedly support.”

Jnanapeeth awardee writer UR Ananthamurthy has also penned a few words in the same booklet: “If I have an education in Indian culture, a large part of it is from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s books. At the level of book reading, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan decolonised India and made us respect ourselves. There are great people in the world whom European colonisers not only cowed into political submission, but also made them forget their past. That could never happen in India, and we owe it to people like Munshi and Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.”

Segment Two

Santhavani’s Segment Two includes devotional talks, discourses, presentations, music and dance recitals, and panel discussions that cover a gamut of reformist movements and philosophies of all faiths prevalent in India. Former Karnataka chief minister Veerappa Moily, scholar Shatavadhani R Ganesh, former ambassador to UNESCO Chiranjiv Singh will be part of the inaugural function on November 15.

Progressive reform movements, socio-religious efforts, and devotional traditions such as the Natha Parampara and Saints from Orissa are some of the topics that will be discussed. The socio-cultural influence of the Haridasas will be followed by a dance-drama on vachanakars on November 16. Other interesting presentations include the philosophical doctrines of Vallabhacharya Sampradaya, the Tattvapada tradition and a talk on Guru Bani.

“The Evangelist church choir will perform at the evening session on November 18. On November 20, Peter Machado, the Archbishop of Bangalore, will speak in the afternoon, followed by a ‘Message of Islam’ presented by Umar Teekay of Teekays Interior Solutions. This would be followed by a Carnatic music concert by Nithyashree Mahadevan,” says Suresh.

He adds that the concluding day of the festival will feature talks on Jainism and Buddhism and a musical on Ramanuja Vaibhavam. “The scope of Santhavani encompasses a wide range of presentations, both secular and scholarly,” he adds.

Santhavani will take place at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Bangalore Kendra till November 21. Entry free, but registration required on bhavankarnataka.com. Call 9845625899 for details",2025-11-14T17:23:52.178388

In an order, the administration headed by the Lieutenant-Governor, which controls the J&K Police, suspended Sunil Singh, serving as the Sub Divisional Police Officer (SDPO), Gandhi Nagar, Jammu, “pending an inquiry”.

The order said the suspension was initiated under Rule 31(1) of the J&K Civil Services (Classification, Control & Appeal) Rules, 1956. “During the period of suspension, DSP Sunil Singh shall remain attached with the Police Headquarters, J&K,” it added.

On November 10, according to a letter by the Jammu and Kashmir Administrative Service (JKAS) officers to the L-G administration, the police officer along with his personal security officers, allegedly “assaulted, abused, and unlawfully detained Azhar Khan, a JKAS officer.” The JKAS officer serves as Block Development Officer, Nagrota, and as Nodal Officer (Transport) for Assembly Constituency 77 – Nagrota. Another official, Abbas Ali, was also reportedly assaulted during the episode, the officers alleged.

In a rare step, the JKAS officers threatened “mass casual leave in protest against the alleged assault and harassment of the officer”. It alleged that Mr. Khan was allegedly manhandled and later booked in a “false and fabricated FIR.”

“The incident has severely shaken the morale of officers engaged in crucial election responsibilities. Such conduct undermines the dignity and safety of civil officers performing statutory duties and raises serious concerns about institutional protection. In solidarity with their colleague, the officers have resolved to proceed on mass casual leave with immediate effect until strict action is taken against the “erring officer(s)” and mechanisms are put in place to prevent recurrence,” the letter said.",2025-11-14T17:23:53.663004

UVH-26 contains 26,646 high-resolution traffic images sourced from Bengaluru’s Safe City project and features 1.8 million bounding-box annotations across 14 India-specific vehicle classes, including two-wheelers, autorickshaws, light commercial vehicles, and buses.

According to a release, the dataset was curated through a nationwide Urban Vision Hackathon that involved more than 560 student volunteers, who contributed to a large crowdsourced annotation effort. High-quality consensus ground truth was generated using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms.

Alongside the dataset, AIM@IISc has released six state-of-the-art object detection models based on YOLOv11, DAMO-YOLO, and RT-DETRv2 architectures, fine-tuned specifically for Indian traffic scenes. These models show up to a 31.5% improvement in mAP@50:95 performance compared to COCO-trained baselines, demonstrating the importance of region-specific data for intelligent transportation systems.

The dataset and models have been made available on HuggingFace under open-source licences. Since their release on November 5, 2025, the UVH-26 resources have already recorded more than 1,500 downloads and are currently ranked as the top trending object detection models on the platform, indicating strong global interest in mobility-focused AI research from the Global South, said the release.

AIM@IISc has invited researchers, developers, students, and policymakers to explore and build upon UVH-26 to advance AI-enabled transportation solutions in emerging economies. The initiative focuses on the use of AI, data-driven methods, and digital twin platforms to tackle mobility challenges such as congestion, safety, and urban planning.

The release was made possible with support from the Bengaluru City Police and Bengaluru Traffic Police, who provided access to imagery from the Safe City project. Additional support came from IISc’s ARTPARK, the Kotak IISc AI-ML Centre, Capital One, and outreach partners including ACM India Council and IEEE India Council.

“India has always been data-poor for AI applications, especially in mobility, given the scale and complexity of Indian traffic. UVH-26 is a testament to how crowdsourced efforts by hundreds of engaged students can create high-quality datasets that rival global benchmarks. This shows the power of community-driven AI for solving local challenges. By making these datasets and model openly available, we aim to catalyse research, development and deployment of AI-driven traffic analytics for safer and smarter cities,” said Yogesh Simmhan, Associate Professor at CDS, IISc.",2025-11-14T17:23:55.369909

“Our contract has come to an end. The new office has metro station right next door to it. So, it is going to be more convenient for employees. There is a lot more happening in Whitefield also socially; So, it was a preferred location shared by employees as well,” said the source.

The company refused to make official statements regarding the development.

Turning heads

The news of Swiggy’s move, which has been in Bellandur for six years, was quick to raise eyebrows as the development comes close on the heels of Blackbuck CEO Rajesh Kumar Yabaji announcing that the company would be moving out of ORR due to poor infrastructure.

“ORR (Bellandur) has been our ‘office + home’ for nine years, but it was getting very hard to continue. We have decided to move out.

However, sources at the Swiggy stressed that the online aggregator is making the move as it is in need of a bigger space and not due to infrastructural woes.

On Thursday, the CPI had unilaterally declared candidates for four wards, accusing the CPI(M) of laying claim to two wards—Sahakarana Road and Health Centre—by encroaching on areas of its influence. It was finally agreed that the CPI would contest the Sahakarana Road ward and relinquish the Health Centre ward to the CPI(M). Additionally, the CPI has been allotted an extra seat, the Infopark ward. Thus, the party will now contest in seven wards compared to six in the previous election.

Talks were held at the State, district and local levels, both over phone and in person, throughout the day before a settlement was reached. With the imbroglio resolved, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) will announce all candidates for the 48 seats of Thrikkakara municipality on Saturday. Apart from the seven seats of the CPI, the other LDF constituents — RJD, NCP,and KC(S) — will contest in a seat each. The CPI(M) will contest in the remaining 38 seats.

The two LDF constituents had been at odds over the two wards, effectively stalling seat-sharing discussions in the municipality, which has traditionally been a United Democratic Front (UDF) stronghold. While the CPI claimed that these wards fell within its sphere of influence, the CPI(M) insisted on contesting in them based on winnability. Although the CPI(M) offered two alternative seats, the CPI argued that it had no viable chance in those wards. In the last election, the CPI had won two of the six seats it had contested in — Athani and Snehanilayam.

The CPI’s argument was that, following delimitation, a majority of votes from the Athani ward—considered its traditional stronghold—had shifted to the Health Centre ward, giving it a legitimate claim. In the case of Sahakarana Road, which absorbed the Mampillyparambu ward following delimitation, the CPI maintained that its entire vote base from the now-defunct ward had been merged into Sahakarana Road, entitling it to field a candidate there.

Even while unilaterally declaring candidates on Thursday, the CPI had left the door open for reconciliation, clarifying that fracturing LDF unity was not its agenda, and that it would revisit its decision if a resolution could be reached.",2025-11-14T17:24:01.695427

The turnaround by the corporate leaders comes close on the heels of the GBA Chief Commissioner M. Maheshwar Rao claiming to have completed the filling of 18,000 potholes and after a prolonged war of words that started with an X post by Ms. Shaw criticising the city’s infrastructural issues.

Mr. Shivakumar who initially took a conciliatory tone, however, later criticised Ms. Shaw for ‘tarnishing the image of the State and the country’ by such social media posts.

In what seemed like a show of white flag, Ms. Shaw visited the Minister on the day of Deepavali, where, according to Mr. Shivakumar, ‘they had an engaging discussion on Bengaluru’s growth, innovation, and the path ahead for Karnataka’s growth story.”

The meeting

Mr. Shivakumar held a meeting with both Mr. Pai and Ms. Shaw after Deepavali, joined by Mr. Rao and other GBA officials. After the meeting, Mr. Shivakumar had said, “Entrepreneurs are our brothers and sisters.”

However, he added that they (entrepreneurs) should not “tarnish” the image of Bengaluru. “I have told them that their criticism will make international news. They have given good suggestions for Bengaluru,” he said.

Mr. Shivakumar also noted that the they had included entrepreneurs in advisory committees.",2025-11-14T17:24:03.204740

While the district police have stood first among all districts with the highest recovery rate of 64%, Usilampatti police have bagged the third rank among all police stations in Tamil Nadu taking efforts for recovering the lost mobile phones.

Madurai district police record every complaint of mobile phone missing/lost under community service register (CSR) and make efforts to trace them by registering the mobile phone details in Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), a portal developed by Department of Telecommunication.

“However, for those mobile phones that are snatched or robbed, we do not use this procedure,” said Madurai District Superintendent of Police B.K. Arvind.

CEIR that operates based on the international Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) of mobile phones would track those phones.

Using the CEIR, the mobile phone lost/missing could be blocked for usage. “However, whenever another SIM card is inserted, the portal would trace it and alert the police,” Mr. Arvind said.

As and when a stolen/missing phone is switched on, the portal would identify it and send an alert to the police.

This portal can trace all the mobile phones irrespective of the mobile service provider across the country.

While technology has made tracking of missing phones easier, the recognition Madurai district police have got is for the human intervention in getting back the phones.

As soon as the portal alerts about tracing of the missing/lost phone along with the new mobile number (based on the new SIM card inserted), the police call the new user to inform him/her about the mobile phone being a lost/stolen property.

“Our men keep talking to them and make them hand it in person or send them to the police. This is where the sincerity in duty of the police makes the difference in early restoration of the lost/missing phone to the owner,” the SP said.

The SP said that tracing and restoring the every second mobile lost is a great achievement. On its part, Usilampatti police station had restored 89% of the lost/missing mobile phones to the owners in the same period.

Mr. Arvind said that value of a lost mobile phone is not just the market cost of the gadget. For, the phones have lot of data stored in it, like photographs, personal details, including bank details. Owners could also have sentimental attachments like it being their first phone or a gift, the SP said.

People only hope for better follow up by police that would help in higher percentage of recovery and restoration of phones to the owners in the coming days.",2025-11-14T17:24:04.795793

The NDA win has seen the BJP become the single largest party in Bihar, matching its spectacular performance in the 2010 polls, when it had won 91 seats. The Janata Dal (United) had bagged 141 seats then.

The BJP’s long campaign for the Bihar polls began months in advance when senior party leaders such as Union Home Minister Amit Shah and party president J. P. Nadda stressed that all constituents have to be on the same page — organisationally, and on messaging. The message that all allies needed to pull their weight in these polls was an important part of the BJP’s own big tally.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s frequent visits to the State and highlighting the governance model of the NDA, with emphasis on infrastructure and women’s empowerment, as compared to ‘jungle raj’ of non-NDA regimes of the past was the leitmotif of the campaign that the BJP stuck to.

There was also the shadow of the 2024 Lok Sabha results, according to BJP leaders. “After the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, people felt upset that they had not given a full majority to the Narendra Modi government, and that has also been a theme in the subsequent polls in Maharashtra, Haryana and Delhi, where we got big victories,” said Mr. Nadda at the ‘thanksgiving rally’ held in Delhi after the results.

While data shows that the large turnout by women is directly linked to NDA victories, the behind-the-scenes management of sometimes inimical alliance partners and rebel candidates disappointed at not receiving party tickets ensured a smooth transfer of votes across the various constituents of the NDA. This micromanagement, led by Mr. Shah, contributed to this transfer of votes across allies.

For example, while the BJP and the JDU, at the time of writing, had won or were leading in 90 and 83 seats respectively, NDA allies Lok Janshakti Party (RV) was ahead on 19 seats (out of the 28 it contested), the Hindustan Awaam Morcha (HAM) was leading in five (out of six) and the Rashtriya Lok Morcha was winning four seats (out of six). Thus, all constituents of the NDA did well.

According to sources, Mr. Shah, who spent 19 days in the State, held mandal to State-level meetings with workers across the parties for coordination.

Over 100 rebel candidates were in the fray at the beginning of the campaign and could have split the NDA’s vote base had they contested. “Amit Shah ji did not schedule any programme for two to three days and met with as many of the rebel candidates of the alliance as possible. Most of them would only be satisfied if he gave them a hearing, and their anxieties were addressed,” said a BJP leader from Bihar.

The 2025 election also had the shadow of the 2020 polls over it, when LJP fought alone and managed to upset the JD(U)’s chances in at least 32 seats, where the LJP’s vote share was more than the margin of defeat of the JD(U) candidate. Meetings were held between the workers of these parties to get them to pull together and make sure that any bitterness of the past did not get in the way this time around. The BJP’s team of Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, both considered quintessential organisation men, reached out to NDA workers and leaders.

Phaneendra, during a surprise inspection on Friday, uncovered lapses and poor living conditions at two Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Post-Matric Girls’ Hostels located at Chikkajala and Kogilu.

At the Chikkajala hostel, Justice Phaneendra found the premises untidy and lacking basic facilities. Students did not have sufficient drinking or usable water, and no solar water or hot water supply was available. The borewell, a key water source, has reportedly remained defunct for the past three years, according to a statement released by Lokayukta. The hostel’s generator has not been operational for nearly the same duration.

Further, several toilets were in poor condition, windows on the first floor were jammed with torn mesh, and newly added floors lacked beds and cots. The inspection also revealed missing amenities such as shoe racks, faulty switchboards, and a first-aid box filled with expired medicines. Doctors were not visiting the hostel as required.

Second hostel

During his visit to the Kogilu girls’ hostel, the Upalokayukta observed similar conditions. The existing water filter was insufficient for students, and no facility had been provided on the upper floors. None of the geysers were functioning, and the hostel lacked access to a library and computer.

In addition, food supplies were found to be unhygienic, grains infested with insects and rotten vegetables being used for cooking. The refrigerator was not working, the water tank had not been cleaned properly, and students faced a daily shortage of food. The warden was also found to be neglecting her duties, and hygiene in the kitchen remained poor. Medicines were not provided to the hostel, and doctors were not making their routine visits.

Justice Phaneendra directed hostel authorities to resolve the major issues within two months, calling the hostels “totally neglected”.",2025-11-14T17:24:26.590280

Vijaysen Reddy of Telangana High Court on Friday cautioned HYDRAA Commissioner A.V. Ranganath against misuse of the powers conferred on the agency.

Observing that power was accorded to officials for serving people, the judge said the authorities had to remember that the courts have superior power. “…the court has superior power… what we have to do, we will do. Do not make us use such power,” the judge told HYDRAA Commissioner appearing virtually before the bench in a contempt of court case.

The judge remarked that demolitions of structures cannot be taken up without adhering to the procedures established by the law even such buildings came up on lands falling under buffer zones or lake bed areas. He sought to know from where did the HYDRAA secure the power to demolish structures without issuing proper notices to the affected persons. “There should be some order, social order, public order…Follow the rules,” he said.

The judge said that some people buy open plots admeasuring 50 to 100 square yards in good faith to have a roof over their heads and land in litigation for various reasons. Sometimes, the governments regularise structures raised in such plots under land regularisation scheme and building regularisation scheme. “Your people are demolishing them on Saturdays and Sundays without issuing notices. Where will the occupants go suddenly?” the judge asked.

The HYDRAA Commissioner informed the bench that the agency had been acting lawfully in all cases. He said the demolitions were taken up while acting upon complaints received through ‘Praja Vani’ programme of the government.

Commissioner Ranganath submitted that HYDRAA has been acting lawfully, removing tonnes of bio-waste and debris from the Tammidi Kunta lake bed to prevent flooding in Hi-Tech City, Metal Charminar and other areas. He stated that many complaints received through the “Praja Vani” programme necessitated such action.

Established at the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, this is the first lab in India that systematically engages with the country’s vast linguistic diversity through experimental linguistics. The lab will explore how humans perceive, process, and produce language using advanced experimental methods.

In the long term, it aims to contribute to the development of human-centred and linguistically aware AI systems, ensuring that India’s languages and cultures are represented in emerging technologies. This lab will work closely with the Centre for Responsible AI (CeRAI), IIT Madras to explore the applications of AI methods to language and cognition research

V. Kamakoti, Director, IIT Madras, said, “Linguistics is increasingly moving toward empirical, data-driven inquiry, combining methodologies from the sciences and humanities. India needed a dedicated facility that integrated linguistic theory with modern experimental and computational tools. The Language and Cognition Lab was established to fill this gap—creating a space that connects linguistics, cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, and contributes to the development of socially relevant, linguistically informed technologies.”

The Language and Cognition Laboratory (LC-Lab) will investigate how people process linguistic information by employing techniques such as eye-tracking and reaction-time studies. Its research focuses primarily on Indian languages, offering crucial insights into how grammar, voice, and sentence structure are understood and produced in multilingual contexts. While ongoing projects study grammatical voice and copula constructions, upcoming work will examine dyslexia in Indian children, with the goal of improving educational outcomes and developing linguistically relevant teaching interventions.

Speaking about the lab, its Faculty Coordinator Anindita Sahoo said, “The Language and Cognition laboratory (LC-Lab) is dedicated to advancing interdisciplinary research in language and cognition through the use of technologies that reveal behavioural patterns and enable data-driven understanding of human interaction.”

The LC-Lab’s interdisciplinary framework integrates insights from science, technology, and the humanities to advance both academic research and technological innovation.

In the short term, the LC-Lab will conduct experimental research using eye-tracking technology to validate established linguistic theories in Indian languages. In the long term, it plans to integrate advanced neurocognitive techniques such as Electroencephalography (EEG) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).

These tools will support comprehensive research in language, cognition, and computational modelling, while fostering collaboration with experts in psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

The lab is currently supported by IITM Pravartak Technologies Foundation and Aspire Infolab, Hyderabad, which have contributed to its establishment and research infrastructure.",2025-11-14T17:24:32.652600

The Congress itself is set to record its worst seat tally in the State since 2010.

2025 Bihar Assembly election results | Live updates

Former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who had emerged as the troubleshooter for the Opposition alliance during the seat-sharing talks, accused the Election Commission of India (ECI) of “colluding” with the ruling coalition in Bihar.

Data | ‘Weak link’ Congress grows even weaker in 2025

Mr. Gehlot claimed that pension payments and cash transfers, including ₹10,000 for women under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana, continued unabated despite the model code of conduct (MCC) being in force.

‘ECI collusion with NDA’

“The Assembly results are disappointing. It seems to me that the payments of ₹10,000 to women were continuing even when the election campaign was on; such a thing never happens,” he said in Jaipur, recalling how, during the 2023 Rajasthan Assembly election, the distribution of mobile phones for women under a welfare scheme and pension disbursements were stopped as soon as the MCC kicked in.

He noted that smart phone distribution was halted in Rajasthan despite 30% of beneficiaries having already received their devices. Even ongoing social security pensions and schemes like Annapurna were stopped, the Congress leader added. He alleged that the NDA government in Bihar had followed the same model as in Maharashtra, where ₹7,500 was given to women beneficiaries.

“In Bihar, the Election Commission remained a mute spectator. Why did it not stop this? It did not intervene at all. When you do not ensure fair elections, when booth capturing or dishonesty takes place, and the Election Commission takes no action, that is vote theft. There was clear collusion with the ruling party,” Mr. Gehlot alleged.

‘Tilted playing field’

His party colleague and Lok Sabha member from Tamil Nadu, Manickam Tagore, blamed the SIR exercise for the rout.

“When you delete 65 lakh voters — mostly the Opposition’s voters — what do you expect on result day? Democracy cannot survive if the playing field is tilted before the match even begins,” Mr. Tagore said in an X post with the hashtag #VoteChori.

Though Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had not yet commented on Friday’s poll results, he had earlier claimed at a press conference that the same pattern would be followed in Bihar as vote theft “has been now industrialised”.

Complete decimation

But no allegation can take away the reality of the worst Congress performance in the past three Assembly elections: from 27 seats in 2015 and 19 seats in 2020, the party was leading in only six seats at the time of filing this report.

The party’s hopes of building momentum for the mahagathbandhan, riding on the popularity of Mr. Gandhi’s Voter Adhikar Yatra which covered 1,300 km across 25 districts in August, were belied. The Congress lost most of the seats that fell along the yatra route, and the defeat of the Bihar Congress chief Rajesh Kumar made the party’s decimation complete.

‘Expel those responsible’

The crushing defeat in Bihar will not only affect the morale of Congress workers in Assam and Kerala, where the party is the main challenger in next year’s Assembly polls, it is also likely to change the dynamics of the INDIA bloc.

Complaining about ticket distribution and party strategy, veteran Congress leader from Bihar Kishore Kumar Jha demanded a probe into the party’s debacle. “Rahul ji should set up a committee to find out who was responsible for the defeat and expel them from the party,” Mr. Jha said.

In an X post, Mumtaz Patel, daughter of the late Ahmed Patel, who had served as political secretary to former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, said the party’s repeated failures were because of “power concentrated in the hands of few who are totally disconnected with ground reality”.",2025-11-14T17:24:37.093762

Vivek Venkatswamy, Ponnam Prabhakar and Tummala Nageshwar Rao, played a decisive role in securing the Congress’s emphatic victory in the Jubilee Hills Assembly byelection.

Entrusted by Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy, with the responsibility of turning a traditionally unfavourable constituency in favour of the Congress, the Ministers began working months before the bypoll notification was issued or a candidate was announced.

Despite Jubilee Hills being a seat that Congress had not won since the formation of Telangana, the Ministers launched an early and deep-reaching outreach programme. They coordinated with local leaders, conducted division-wise meetings, and penetrated pockets where the party had historically struggled.

Development works worth hundreds of crores were sanctioned for the constituency, significantly strengthening the government’s connect with residents.

Labour and Employment Minister Vivek Venkatswamy took the lead by addressing numerous colony meetings and targeted interactions with various sections of society. At a time when the BRS appeared to have a head start with the early announcement of its candidate, Mr. Vivek worked to neutralise its initial advantage.

“When we first entered the constituency, BRS had a massive lead on sympathy and other related factors. But within just three months of dedicated work, we managed to wipe out that entire difference,” he told The Hindu. “CM Revanth Reddy entrusted us with the job with immense confidence, and we delivered this victory. CM’s public meetings neutralised all the BRS negative campaign.”

Mr. Vivek described the result as a ‘clear rejection of the BRS leadership and its policies’, pointing out that the party had been losing elections consistently from the Assembly polls to the Lok Sabha elections, the Cantonment bypoll, and now Jubilee Hills. He said the BRS depended excessively on social media narratives while ignoring on-ground realities. “This win is not accidental. We listened to people’s concerns and addressed them.”

Minister Ponnam Prabhakar undertook extensive tours across the constituency, meeting influential individuals and diverse communities to consolidate Congress support. He connected the social agenda of the party with the masses here and energised the cadre.

Agriculture Minister Tummala Nageswar Rao focused specifically on mobilising TDP-leaning voters, a segment seen as critical in the constituency. His efforts were credited with drawing former TDP supporters into the Congress fold, bolstering the party’s prospects further.",2025-11-14T17:24:38.595579

Mr. Chandrasekharan, who is facing conspiracy charges in the case, will contest from the Chelakkara ward.

A former chairperson of the municipality, he had stepped down from the post in 2015 due to bail conditions that restricted his entry into the district. The CPI(M) is aiming to bring him back as the chairperson if the party retains its hold. Mr. Chandrasekharan, a senior leader and CPI(M) area committee member, remains influential in Thalassery, where the Left expects to maintain its long standing dominance over the municipality.

The number of wards has risen from 52 to 53 this election. The Left Democratic Front has completed seat allocation across all wards, with the CPI(M) contesting in 46 seats and the CPI in five. One seat each has been allotted to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Indian National League (INL).

Seat sharing discussions within the United democratic Front (UDF) is nearing completion. The new ward, Guards, as become a point contention between the Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), with both citing organisational presence in the adjoining areas. In the remaining wards, the current understanding is that the Congress will contest in 35 wards and the IUML in 17. The UDF currently holds seven seats in the municipality- the Congress in three and the IUML in four seats.

The National Democratic Alliance is expected to announce its candidates soon. Thalassery remains the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) strongest base in Kannur district in terms of council representation and the party is looking to improve its tally. However, recent controversies involving its leaders, including alleged involvement of BJP leader K. Lijesh in the murder of CPI(M) worker K. Haridas in Punnol, have weakened its position.

The delay in its campaign, the internal conflict over seat distribution, and rigidity over the chief ministerial candidate are some of the major issues that did not allow Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) to take off.

Though its top leaders such as Tejashwi Yadav and Rahul Gandhi tried to show a united front in public, the infighting within the alliance impacted its cohesiveness. Selection of candidates and seat distribution at the eleventh hour, when the last date of the nomination was near, led to distraction among the voters.

The RJD being rigid about Tejashwi Yadav as the Chief Ministerial candidate also cost the alliance dear. The tug of war between the RJD and the Congress over the CM face had become so intense that the All India Congress Committee (AICC) senior observer for the Bihar Assembly election, Ashok Gehlot, had to fly to Patna to meet Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad and his son Tejashwi Yadav.

This particular reason delayed the election campaign. Only after Mr. Yadav was named the CM candidate on October 23, did he start his election campaign.

Mr. Yadav got only 17 days to campaign and in this short period, he could devote only less time to every public meeting that he addressed. Initially, he started with 10 to 12 public meetings daily, but as days progressed, he had to address nearly 18 public meetings to cover all 243 Assembly segments.

The way Mr. Yadav was adamant on being the CM nominee, Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani insisted on being the Deputy CM candidate, which again spoiled their image among the public.

Allegations against the Congress over the “sale” of ticket, as well as the party’s decision to drop candidates who won the last election, did not go down well with the electorate.

Mr. Yadav who was heading the INDIA bloc made several election promises, including government job to one member of every family – seen by many as impractical.

During the entire campaign of the RJD and the Congress, attack on Special Intensive Revision (SIR) and vote chori (vote theft) was the central theme, which did not work on the ground. Not only this, the friendly fight within the alliance in 12 Assembly seats led to division of votes.

For the last one decade, the RJD was the single largest party, winning 75 seats in the last Assembly election. This time, the RJD fielded 143 candidates, the maximum among the INDIA bloc, but fared miserably.

The worst performance was by the VIP, which could not open an account. Mr. Sahani was given 15 seats in the alliance.

Similarly, the Congress was given 62 seats, of which it won six seats. The performance of all three Left parties in Bihar was equally poor with the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (Liberation) winning two seats out of the 20 seats it contested. The CPI(M) won one seat.",2025-11-14T17:24:52.357325

Ansiya, Deputy Mayor of the outgoing Kochi Corporation council and mandalam secretary of the CPI’s women’s wing, Mahila Sangham, announced her resignation from the party here on Friday.

In a surprise move, Ms. Ansiya made the announcement at a press conference, accusing the party of being reduced to a few individuals. She alleged that the candidate for the sixth ward was decided unilaterally, ignoring the names of hard working members of the Mahila Sangham.

“I have immense love for the CPI, which is corruption-free. The party allowed me to function independently without making unfair demands. But the party being reduced to a few individuals will leave it rootless in the Kochi mandalam and deny rightful opportunities to more women,” Ms. Ansiya said.

‘Not party member’

She further alleged that the candidate whose name topped the list of probables and was eventually selected for the ward was not a party member and had no association with the Mahila Sangham. She claimed that the district committee disregarded the sentiments of the Kochi mandalam committee.

Later, the mandalam committee issued a statement dismissing Ms. Ansiya’s allegations as baseless. It saidthe list of candidates with three names was finalised based on the majority decision of the mandalam committee and forwarded to the district committee, which approved the candidacy of P.H. Anila, whose name was first on the list.

“The mandalam committee approved the list of candidates in the most democratic manner. The same protocol was followed when Ms. Ansiya was made the candidate five years ago. At that time, she was not even a party member, yet the party made her the Deputy Mayor.

“Standardising pension schemes for all government employees is the need of the hour,” Special Chief Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said. He urged industry players to continue innovating and introduce new products and services for the underserved.

The senior official, addressing the programme organised by PFRDA in association with KFintech, said many people remain reluctant to discuss retirement planning. With India’s large population and its demographic dividend, he the need is to prepare for the ageing population that is projected to rise by 10% in the next decade.

Telangana has a well-structured pension framework for government and organised-sector employees. “But what about people in the unorganised sector?” he asked. In this backdrop, gig and platform workers in Telangana are set to receive social protection under the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers (Registration, Social Security and Welfare) Act, 2025, which is expected to be tabled in the next Assembly session, Mr. Ranjan said.

In a release, the organisers said the conclave sought to enhance corporate participation in the NPS and explore how technology can help expand pension access across the country, especially to underserved sections.

PFRDA Chairperson S. Ramann said people generally avoid conversations about retirement savings, especially pensions. “Many remain unaware of financial planning, wealth creation and financial instruments. Our mandate has always been — grow rich before you grow old,” he said, emphasising the need for technology-driven financial inclusion.

India has a workforce of more than 55 crore of which 10 crore are in the organised sector. “This presents a massive opportunity for pension products.

Streevadi Sahitya Vimarshe Mattu Kannada Sahitya Sandarbha, written by Ms. Sreemathi, and Kannada Nuri Rachane and Hosa Odugarigagi Kuvempu, written by Mr. Narayana, were released on the occasion.

Ms. Sreemathi, speaking on the occasion, said questioning patriarchy should not be construed as questioning men; instead, it was a way of understanding the dynamics of patriarchy. “At some stage in the evolution process, males dominated over women for reasons specific to that time. We need to understand why the dynamics never changed afterwards, though men and women are equal in every sense,” she said.

Her book, the author stated, was an attempt to find answers to her questions on feminist criticism. “Feminist literary criticism is not merely a discussion on literature. Instead, it is an academic activity that exposes the reality that literary texts, as products of the system, justify and reinforce patriarchal thinking and aspirations,” she opined.

K.V. Narayana said the thoughts he was proposing on the structure of Kannada language in his book Kannada Nudi Rachane, were totally different from what had already been discussed so far. Besides that, he used different terminology to analyse the language structure. He used new terms for words like – vakya (sentence), vyakarana (grammar) – while placing his arguments on the language through the concept of explanatory adequacy, in his work, he elaborated.

His other book on Kuvempu’s speeches and essays was an attempt to understand the writer with respect to the time of his writing and the present.

Mr. Kishore Kumar pointed out that the government was encouraging coffee cultivation by extending subsidies and incentives for the crop. India produces 3.60 lakh metric tonnes of coffee annually, of which 2.30 lakh metric tonnes are exported while the remaining is traded domestically, he said.

Karnataka accounts for about 60% to 65% of India’s annual coffee production, with Kodagu district alone contributing 30%-35% while the adjoining Chikmagaluru and Hassan districts contribute 25%-30%. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh together account for another 20%-30%, while the North Eastern States contributed about 10%-15%, he explained.

India earns about ₹15,000 crore in foreign exchange from coffee production, and the target is to reach ₹50,000 crore by 2047. He said the farmers can achieve this by reaching a production target of 7 lakh metric tonnes.

He emphasised that farmers should use drip irrigation and other methodologies to achieve high production at low cost.

With Karnataka’s coffee enjoying a huge demand, Mr. Kishore Kumar said there was a need to strengthen the co-operative sector so that loan facilities can be provided to the farmers and the economy can be strengthened.

Kodagu District Co-operative Central Bank President K P Ganapathy said there were a total of 288 co-operative societies operating in Kodagu district. Leaders of Kodagu district had established co-operatives for coffee, cardamom, honey and oranges.

Farmers receive easy loan facilities through co-operatives and must make proper use of them, he said while adding that the Co-operative Week provides an opportunity to discuss the strengths and shortcomings of the co-operative sector so that steps can be taken in the right direction.

During the co-operative week, a free health check-up camp was held. A market fair was also organized by members of Sanjeevini group, who sold vegetables and other items.",2025-11-14T17:25:09.614788

Based on a complaint lodged by an Agriculture Department official stating that a three-member gang from Beed district in Maharashtra was illegally transporting pesticides to Motakpalli village in Sedam taluk and selling them causing losses to farmers and the State government, a case was registered by the Mudhol Police.

The police booked the three, Sophan Shesharao Tonde, Narayan and Siris, in September 2007 and filed a charge-sheet in March 2008.

While Narayan and Siris later appeared before court, Sophan Tonde, the prime accused, never attended any hearing. In 2016, the court declared the case as long pending.

Acting on the directions of Superintendent of Police Addur Srinivasalu, Additional Superintendent of Police Mahesh Meghannavar and Deputy Superintendent of Police Sangamanath Hiremath, a special team led by Mudhol Police Inspector Daulat N. Kuri intensified efforts to locate the absconding accused.

For the last four months, the team carried out surveillance across multiple locations in Maharashtra, constantly tracking Sophan Tonde’s movements and finally arrested him on Thursday in Chopanwadi village of Ambajogai taluk in Beed district.

Speakers said that without women-led, community-driven networks, digital inclusion will remain uneven and exclusionary across South Asia.

Gayani Perera, project manager at Foundation.lk, a not-for-profit organisation based in Sri Lanka, spoke about how fear, surveillance and cyberbullying continue to keep women away from online spaces. Her organisation’s ‘Hitavathi’ centres, around 30 now operating across Sri Lanka, provide safe environments where women can learn, work and navigate the internet without judgement or intimidation. These spaces that work as help centres as well as e-learning platforms, have helped women rebuild confidence, acquire new skills and overcome long-held apprehensions about using technology, she said.

Hyderabad-based academic Sarbani Banerjee Belur said that connectivity projects often fail women because they overlook who actually ends up using digital access points. In many rural areas, she said, the spaces created for “community access” are quickly monopolised by young and older men, leaving women excluded, especially those who do not own mobile phones.

Mahima Sonal, working with Soochnapreneur - rural entrepreneurship-based project initiated by Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF), from Utrakhand shared how community centres have transformed women’s livelihoods by helping them upskill, learn basic computing and take traditional handicraft work online. She said women engage more openly when guided by another woman, making female leadership critical for digital empowerment in rural areas.

Audience from Sri Lanka highlighted the “dual burden” that restricts women’s access to technology - domestic responsibilities combined with cultural conditioning that confines them to household roles.

Another member stressed the need for platforms where women can speak freely about issues including harassment, emotional distress and discrimination. “This initiative cannot just prevent instances of suicides in Sri Lankan women but can also help improve the emotional health of women,” the speaker said.

The session closed with a call to boost women in leadership roles in digital initiatives and to build networks that prioritise confidence, connection and equitable participation beyond profit-driven platform structures.",2025-11-14T17:25:12.635938

Chairing the fifth Advisory Meeting on Cancer Disease Burden at the Health and Family Welfare Department headquarters in Mangalagiri, Dr. Dattatreyudu said: “This atlas will be created using ground-level data, and will help in planning preventive strategies, raising public awareness and improving medical infrastructure. It will soon be submitted to Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and Health Minister Satya Kumar Yadav.”

Data from the government and private hospitals and from the Non-Communicable Diseases Control and Prevention Programme (NCD 4.0) screenings will be consolidated to prepare the atlas. Information from patients treated under the Dr. NTR Vaidya Seva Trust will provide a clearer picture of the regional cancer trends, he added.

He noted that organisations like Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) publish estimates based only on sample data, but the ongoing State-level data collection would produce reliable, ground-level statistics. He advised officials to ensure that there are no delays in referring screened individuals for further tests and insisted that details of treatment, wherever taken, should be recorded by the health staff.

He emphasised creating awareness about preventive oncology units in teaching hospitals and ensuring that patients coming from villages were given priority in these units through the “green channel”.

High case load in urban areas

CEO of Dr. NTR Vaidya Seva Trust Dinesh Kumar informed that cancer cases were predominantly higher in urban areas. Since the trust’s inception (2006–07), 3,29,183 cancer patients had received treatment under it, with the government spending ₹4,616 crore. Detailed reports are being prepared using these patient records, he said.

Director of Secondary Health K. Chakradhar Babu said nine day-care chemotherapy centres were currently operating in district hospitals, with patient numbers rising and more such centres would be established.

Health Commissioner Veerapandian, who joined the meeting virtually, said that the department would soon hold a special conference with private oncologists and that it was committed to implementing the suggestions given of Dr. Dattatreyudu.

Progress under NCD 4.0

NCD Programme Joint Director Shyamala said under NCD 4.0, 45.68 lakh oral cancer screenings had been conducted, breast and cervical cancer screenings for women were ongoing and individuals needing re-examination were being referred to PHC doctors, who then direct them to Preventive Oncology Units if necessary.",2025-11-14T17:25:14.141803

The Vaigai dam, which has a maximum storage level of 71 feet, would release the surplus water into the 18-canal on reaching its maximum level or whenever the water level crossed 70 feet. Depending on the forecast and the inflow into the reservoir, the WRD officials discharged the water.

Every year, the water from the dam would be released for the old ayacutdars of Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga and Madurai district. Similarly, water for irrigation and for drinking purposes, the water would be released. The surplus water from the reservoir would be released into the 58-canal as it would provide water for irrigation in the Usilampatti and surrounding habitations.

On October 29, the water was released in the 18-canal. However, it was suspended yesterday (Nov 14). “We are upset as the water was released only for 17 days, farmers said and expressed concern. The T.N. government should release water as and when the storage level crossed the 67 feet mark and not stick to the rule of discharging the surplus water for us....” they said.

The farmers’ associations in Usilampatti block fought for many decades and got the 18-canal project. Under such circumstances, only when the canal received water, the farmers’ would benefit. Such suspension in the midway would be of no use to the ryots as 150 cusecs of water discharged was insufficient. Hence, the T.N. government should issue an order to the effect that water shall be released in the 18-canal as and when the storage level reached 67 feet, they added.",2025-11-14T17:25:17.139270

The first — “25 se 30, phir se Nitish (From 2025 to 2030, it is Nitish’s government again)” — appeared in May, long before the campaign gathered steam. The second — “Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai (Tiger is still alive)” — was erected a day before the results were declared.

The first one was an assertion as well as a reflection of the JD(U)’s anxiety. There were reports of Mr. Kumar’s declining mental acuity. There was also speculation that he will be replaced, with the BJP promoting its nominee instead. The poster with Mr. Kumar, in a blue Nehru jacket, placed against a yellow background with the slogan inscribed in black, was to underline Mr. Kumar as the undisputed Chief Minister. However, Mr. Kumar’s administration needed a little more than just rhetoric.

It was around this time that the seeds for the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana were sown. In his first term, Mr. Kumar began a network of women self-help groups under the World Bank-aided Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project (BRLP), locally known as Jeevika. This network has seen Mr. Kumar through various ups and downs.

His administration decided to tap into this network once again. A one-time ₹10,000 financial aid was extended to 1.21 crore beneficiaries associated with Jeevika. It cost ₹12,100 crore, which is roughly 4% of Bihar’s annual budget.

Careful consolidation of women voters

The administration looked at various schemes extending financial aid to women, including Maharashtra’s Ladki Bahin Yojana, a monthly payout scheme which is straining the State’s finances. It was a deliberate decision, according to top JD(U) leaders, to opt for extending an one-time financial assistance instead of monthly payouts.

The scheme was rolled out on September 26 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the election schedule was announced by the Election Commission of India (EC) on October 6.

The gamble paid off. The scheme consolidated women voters across caste lines, delivering anticipated dividends for the JD(U) and the NDA. The JD(U) was the only party to report a significant rise in vote share — from 15.39% in 2020 to 19.03%. The BJP’s share rose only marginally, from 19.46% to 20.42%. This marks Mr. Kumar’s second-best performance after 2010, when the JD(U) won 115 of 141 seats contested. As per the provisional voter turnout data released by the EC, 2.51 crore women voted in this election.

The table below shows the number of seats/districts with various shares of women voters in the 2025 Bihar Assembly Elections.

Women-centric schemes

“It would be simplistic to credit the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana alone for the JD(U)’s performance. People voted for Nitish Kumar’s experience, clean image, good governance, law and order, and progress,” said JD(U) national spokesperson K.C. Tyagi. Mr. Tyagi pointed out various women-centric schemes of the Nitish Kumar government. “Kumar has had a generational connection with women. In 2006, he first gave reservation to women representatives in panchayat and municipal bodies; in 2007, he gave 35% reservation to women in the Bihar Police. His government pays for stationary and uniforms for girl children. The decision to impose prohibition also came directly from the women,” he added.

On October 12, six days after the election schedule was announced, the NDA finalised its seat-sharing formula. For the first time since Mr. Kumar aligned with the BJP in the mid-1990s, both parties contested an equal number of seats — 101 each.

From then on, the narrative shifted. Reports emerged of Mr. Kumar reprimanding close aides for undermining party interests, some of which played out publicly at rallies. He also pressured the BJP to make the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) return four to five seats allocated to it but claimed by the JD(U) — signalling that Mr. Kumar was still firmly in control.

A day before the results, the JD(U)’s Patna office unveiled the poster reading “Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai.” Sponsored by a party leader, it carried the clutter typical of election posters — still its assertion was vindicated.",2025-11-14T17:25:20.120822

A Division Bench of Justices Anita Sumanth and C. Kumarappan was hearing a petition filed by Rama Udayasuriyan of Avudaiyanoor in Tenkasi district. The petitioner sought a direction to the authorities to open the Collectorate and make it fully functional.

Considering the long standing demand of the people of Tenkasi, he said, Tenkasi district was formed in 2019 by bifurcating Tirunelveli district with the Headquarters at Tenkasi. Since government offices were functioning in rental buildings in the newly formed district, the State government proposed to construct a combined Collectorate building with space for all offices.

Accordingly, the State government sanctioned ₹119 crore for the construction of the combined Collectorate building in 2020. The construction work was entrusted to the Public Works Department. The construction work commenced in 2021 and 90% work was completed.

Under these circumstances, S.P. Muthuraman filed a petition before the High Court in 2022 complaining about violation of building and environmental norms. The court, after hearing the parties, found that the construction of the Collectorate building commenced before obtaining the necessary environmental clearances.

Considering the larger public interest, the court in 2022 directed the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to expeditiously dispose of the application submitted by the PWD for environmental clearances.

However, TNPCB did not honour the order of the court. PWD, who is duty bound to urge TNPCB to comply with the order, also did not take any efforts. The building is now abandoned. The authorities have caused a huge financial loss to the State’s exchequer. The authorities remained idle and were not taking necessary steps to get the environmental clearance and open the building for public utility, he complained.

Officers said three arrests were linked to trading scams, while one involved a smishing (SMS phishing) operation. Five mobile phones, a smartwatch, SIM cards and other digital devices were seized during the raids.

Police also secured 42 refund orders in 26 cases, amounting to ₹21,98,753, which will be returned to victims following court directions.

Among the major cases was the cheating of a private employee who lost ₹21,93,300 in a fake trading scam run through Telegram and WhatsApp groups. The victim was approached by a woman identifying herself as Ben Sasha, who lured him into using a fraudulent trading app and encouraged him to make trial trades that showed artificially inflated profits. Once he gained confidence, scammers guided him to deposit money into bank accounts they claimed were linked to a foreign exchange trading platform.

The victim initially received two small withdrawals of ₹5,000, which were used to build trust. He was then persuaded to invest larger amounts and was shown fictitious profits running into crores. When he attempted to withdraw funds, he was pressured to pay a series of charges, including a 30% tax, security deposit and conversion fee. Later, he was told his CIBIL score was inadequate and was asked to transfer an additional ₹15 lakh. When he questioned these demands, the suspects deleted his trading account and chat history, leaving him with a virtual balance that never existed.

Investigators confirmed he had transferred ₹21,93,300 from his bank accounts into several beneficiary accounts.

Speaking as the chief guest at the 80th Scientific Temperament celebrations, he emphasised that Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy’s administration is dedicated to nurturing scientific thinking across the State. The government aims to develop Telangana as a “laboratory for scientific development”, he said, noting that all Cabinet ministers are well educated and focused on ensuring the State competes globally in innovation and growth.

He credited India’s scientific foundations to Jawaharlal Nehru, stating that the nation’s current position would have been unimaginable without Nehru’s leadership as the first Prime Minister.

Reflecting on India’s early challenges after Independence, he highlighted Nehru’s focus on agriculture, industry, and mixed economic policies, along with his encouragement of scientific research through institutions like IITs, the UGC, and national laboratories. This vision, he said, laid the groundwork for India’s democratic stability and technological advancement.

“In the early 1980s, if I wanted to make a phone call, I had to go to Abids, book a trunk call, and wait for hours. Today, we are connected to the entire world through a mobile phone in our palm. This is the power of scientific progress,” he said. “If during disasters people are only told to light lamps or clap hands, this country would have gone astray,” he commented.

He noted that because of Nehru’s visionary policies, a peaceful transition of power was possible, after elections every five years. But, he remarked that societies become cursed when they are governed by people without vision.

Mr. Vikramarka outlined the ongoing initiatives such as the establishment of Young India Integrated Residential Schools in each Assembly constituency and the upgrading of ITIs into Advanced Technology Centres.

He added that the upcoming Skill University will further strengthen scientific temperament in Telangana’s emerging Future City. He encouraged educational institutions to launch science exhibitions and assured them full support from government.

He encouraged students to explore opportunities in sectors such as agriculture, water management, and household automation—ranging from smart irrigation systems to sensor-based indoor plant care. “India still needs a tremendous amount of innovations. The possibilities are vast, and your ideas can truly shape the country’s future,” he added.

Hanumantrao Kulkarni, Senior Manager, Learning and Development, Incture Technologies, highlighted that the world today requires both thinkers and doers. “AI bridges the gap between ideation and execution, enabling everyone to become both,” he said.

Addressing the gathering, principal B. Sadashive Gowda said hackathons play a vital role in enhancing students’ creativity, problem-solving ability, and logical thinking—skills that industries expect but seldom taught directly.

He spoke about India’s rise in global innovation rankings and stressed the need for the country to transition from a service-based economy to a product-driven one. “Innovative young minds like yours can lead this transformation by converting ideas into impactful products,” he said.

Thimmapur, sugarcane farmers ended their two-week-long strike for higher prices in Mudhol.

This comes a day after an incident of sabotage where several tractor trolleys were set on fire in front of the Godavari Bio-refineries sugar factory in Sameerwadi of Bagalkot district.

Farmers dropped their demand for ₹3,500 per tonne of sugarcane and agreed to settle for the government-fixed price of ₹3,300 per tonne, to be paid in three instalments. They, however, demanded that the factories settle old dues of around ₹20 crore, to sugarcane growers in four days.

They also demanded that all bills be settled in two weeks from procurement.

Mr. Thimmapur announced in Bagalkot on Friday that the meeting was successful and that the agitation has been withdrawn.

The protest continued as several rounds of meetings held by Mr. Thimmapur, Deputy Commissioner Sangappa and others failed.

On Thursday, as per initial estimates, 100 loads of sugarcane crop, 20 tractor trolleys and four tractors suffered damage.

Farmers leaders thanked the Minister and the police for their cooperation during the protest in Mudhol. They apologized to Additional Superintendent of Police Mahanteshwar Jiddi who suffered injuries during the protest and has been admitted to hospital for treatment.",2025-11-14T17:25:30.136830

Chandrababu Naidu said the mandate reflected the people’s aspiration for development, welfare and good governance.

Mr. Naidu participated as the chief guest at the Andhra Pradesh Reimagining Public Finance Summit held at a private hotel in Visakhapatnam on Friday, on the sidelines of the ongoing CII Partnership Summit. Stressing the importance of delivering welfare schemes, he said: “I had satisfied my people by extending welfare schemes. Today, you have seen the Bihar election results. The NDA won 209 seats — something unprecedented in Bihar. It indicates that people want development, empowerment, welfare and good governance. With this comes stability, and stability will lead to further progress in welfare.”

Organised by the State Finance Department in collaboration with Elets Technomedia, the two-day summit aims to build a forward-looking framework for fiscal innovation, sustainable capital mobilisation, PPP-led development and institutional transformation.

Mr. Naidu underscored the need to adopt reforms that pave the way for public welfare and said that his government’s policy decisions have resulted in development and benefits for poor and middle-class people. He said policies must be adapted to changing circumstances, citing Hyderabad as an example of development achieved through policy reforms. The reforms in the power sector introduced in 1999, he noted, strengthened the sector, and Telangana continues to reap the benefits.

Further, he said the State government would open escrow accounts for industrial incentives and extend sovereign guarantees to investors.

Mr. Naidu said he has envisioned a transformative roadmap for the State through Swarna Andhra 2047.

The session was organised by Commons Collective and led by digital journalist Roshna Arafa Ali, Rajasekhar P, operations, Ottocomm, and researcher Gaya Hadiya, with Siddhartha Malempati, directing council general, Commons Collective, moderating the discussion.

The speakers said AI’s rapid spread into professional, political and personal spaces had collided with long-existing workplace systems already stacked against employees. Roshna argued that job losses blamed on AI were often the result of employers using the technology as a convenient justification to hire fewer people, cut costs and avoid providing benefits.

“Mid-level roles such as database administrators, IT specialists and data analysts, were among those most vulnerable to AI driven restructuring,” she said, and added that workplaces were far from ideal even before AI arrived.

“Many industries had long normalised unhealthy competition, overwork and a reluctance to collectively demand safer conditions. Within this context, AI has become an attractive tool for companies wanting to replace labour that requires rest and rights with machines that require neither.” This strain, she noted, was already pushing women and marginalised communities further away from formal employment.

The workshop also highlighted the hidden labour that keeps AI systems functioning, from large scale data extraction that takes place without genuine consent to poorly paid content labelling and maintenance work. Gaya Hadiya described this as a form of undervalued and often invisible labour that sustains the technology while benefiting only a narrow set of corporate owners.

The discussion moved to emerging ethical concerns, including companies exploring the use of AI as workplace or student counsellors. Panelists questioned whether an AI funded by an employer would ever advise an employee to confront overwork, form a collective or demand better conditions. “Instead such systems may simply push individuals to cope better so that productivity remains uninterrupted,” said Rajashekar.

“Human intelligence is relational, emotional and grounded in live experience, and cannot be reduced to pattern prediction,” he said.

The session also examined questions of governance and accountability. “These resources are inherently public and should not be enclosed by private entities. Governance must identify who sets the purpose and limits of AI systems and who should be held responsible when these systems cause harm,” he added.

The workshop closed by urging broader public engagement with AI governance. Speakers said discussions on ethics and regulation cannot remain confined to engineers or industry professionals, since the consequences of AI extend far beyond the technology sector. They called for collective participation and transparent rule making to ensure that AI serves society at large, not just those who control its infrastructure.",2025-11-14T17:25:34.989435

Built in 2014, the central span of the bridge across the Tamirabharani river connecting Mukkani and North Authoor was severely damaged, making the structure unsafe for vehicular traffic. Before the damage, the new bridge was used by vehicles approaching Thoothukudi, while the old bridge was used by the vehicles heading towards Tiruchendur.

Since the damage was reported, the old bridge has been used as a two way route, leading to congestion during peak hours and festival days. Almost after two years the restoration work has begun at the new bridge, for which the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has allocated ₹4.77 crore for the project.

A few months ago, the officials from the NH department said that experts from IIT-Madras were involved in preparing restoration plans for the bridge, and the project would commence after the government approval.

Speaking about the project, an engineer from the NH said that the 260 metre bridge has 14 spans and crumbling damages were reported in two piers in the central portion, leading to a cave-in of the structure.

Explaining that the bridge has been constructed in a pier model, he noted that the NH department has been undertaking restoration measures based on the recommendations of an expert team from IIT-Madras. He added that the team has recommended the stabilisation of sunken pillars along with all the pillar and elevation of dented decks.

“Although ₹4.77 crore has been allocated for the project, after the deduction of GST and other service costs, the bridge will be constructed at an outlay of around ₹4.50 crore.

Speaking to media persons in Tirupati on Friday, Mr. Karunakar Reddy said Mr. Satish Kumar was relentlessly harassed, threatened, and mentally tortured by the investigating agency on the name of investigation in the Parakamani theft case, ultimately driving him to suicide.

The meeting, chaired by Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar, who also holds the Water Resources portfolio, reviewed water availability in the Tungabhadra Reservoir and discussed supply constraints arising from the ongoing installation of crest gates, in the event of the water level reaching 1,613 ft.

In view of these works, the Irrigation Consultative Committee noted that it will not be possible to provide water for an extended irrigation season and therefore, it resolved to release water primarily for standing crops and essential uses, including drinking needs during summer.

Accordingly, it was decided that water will be released into the Tungabhadra Left Bank Main Canal starting December 1, 2025 till January 10, 2026 at a rate of 3,000 cusecs for standing crops.

The Vijayanagar Left Bank Canal will receive water from January 1 to May 10, 2026, at 150 cusecs, covering distributary canals 1 to 11, subject to availability.

For the Tungabhadra Right Bank High Level Canal, water will be supplied from December 1, 2025 to January 10, 2026 at a rate of 1,300 cusecs, while the Tungabhadra Right Bank Low Level Canal will receive water during the same period at 750 cusecs for only standing crops.

The Raya Basavanna canal will get an average supply of 250 cusecs from January 1 to May 31, 2026 or until water remains available, whichever is earlier.

In addition, it was resolved to supply 150 cusecs to the river-supplemented areas, including industrial units dependent on the system.

The committee also approved release of water into the Left Bank High Level Canal from December 1 at 25 cusecs until the reservoir level falls to 1,585 ft.

Speaking after the meeting, Irrigation Consultative Committee Chairman and Minister Shivaraj S. Tangadagi said that the schedule balanced the limited water availability with the need to protect standing crops in the command areas.

He said that the decision reflects the consensus reached after detailed deliberations with people’s representatives, irrigation officials and district administrations.

Mr. Udhayanidhi Stalin on the occasion of Children’s Day, at Alagappa Model School in Karaikudi on Friday, distributed free bicycles to Class XI students.

Speaking there, he added, “Education can eradicate poverty in a family. But it does not just provide wealth and money, but also gives confidence and power. That is why the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin is implementing several schemes and policies in both school and higher education sectors compared to anywhere else in India.”

Claiming the highest percentage of girl students being educated in the State as a success of the Dravidian model government, he stated that of the total of 5.35 lakh bicycles that were distributed to students across Tamil Nadu, more than 57,000 were girl children.

“The number far exceeds the number of boys. This is because of the successful enrolment of girl students in schools,” he noted.

He advised the students to develop their power of thinking. Adding that students were capable of thinking on par with adults, he surprisingly said, “In fact, many times, children are the teachers to their own parents.”

Emphasising the ‘rationalism’ espoused and followed by great leaders like Periyar, C.N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi, Mr. Udhayanidhi appealed to the students to constantly seek answers to their questions.

“Only through constant questioning – Why, What and How – can we get the answers we need. This is how Tamil Nadu has become the best State in education in the country,” he elaborated.

The students of the State should develop perseverance and develop their thinking skills to be able to elevate Tamil Nadu to a level where the students could compete with global nations.

On the various government schemes which were supporting the students at multiple levels, he said, “The Breakfast Scheme is being provided to 22 lakh children in schools, under the Thamizh Pudhalvan and Pudhumai Penn schemes, eight lakh college students receive ₹1,000 per month and soon, the free laptop scheme will also be implemented in colleges.”

He commented that the ‘reels’ shared on social media platforms were not real life, and about three quarters of the content shown there were false and misleading.

“The reels should not give a false perception about life. Only the real education you possess, and follow will stand by you,” he added.

Additionally, Mr. Udhayanidhi Stalin requested the teachers not to borrow the physical education classes for other subjects. “Physical education is as important to a student as other subjects,” he added.

About 12,500 free bicycles were distributed to 12,500 students in the district.

A key focus will be on verifying that all work zone safety norms, and the rules for protecting workers and the public near the construction site are being followed as per the guidelines stipulated by the Indian Road Congress (IRC).

Based on the outcome of the Aroor-Thuravoor audit, NHAI will adopt steps to expand the safety inspection work to other stretches of the NH-66 corridor to ensure uniform safety and quality across all major highway projects in the region.

Officials from the NHAI, including members of an expert committee, on Friday visited the site of the girder collapse at the Aroor-Thuravoor elevated highway where a pickup driver was killed to ascertain the cause of the accident. The team examined the spot where a girder had fallen as well as the area where it had been installed. Representatives of the contractor responsible for the construction on the particular stretch of the national highway were also present.

The District Collector has sought a detailed report regarding the accident, which apparently brought to fore lapses by various agencies in ensuring public and motorists’ safety.

Alappuzha MP K.C.

Eminent ornithologists, bird lovers, bird watchers, nature enthusiasts, and green activists gathered at the venue. Activities for students included weaving nests, identifying bird species, and interactive sessions on bird conservation.

T. Siddique, MLA, who inaugurated the festival, said birds played an important role in sustaining fragile ecosystems across the world. “The notion that human beings are at the top of everything in nature has resulted in widespread destruction,” he said, adding that birds are the real saviours of nature. “Until the Mundakkai–Chooralmala landslide struck, society had not given much attention to issues concerning nature, but the tragedy changed everything,” he said, stressing the need for environmental awareness.

Principal Conservator of Forests Pramod G. Krishnan was the guest of honour. Kerala State Biodiversity Board Chairman N. Anilkumar delivered the keynote address. Hume Centre advisory board chairman G. Balagopal presided.

The festival features a ‘Birder’s Stall’ that showcases details of various unique bird species, methods for identifying them, their life patterns, the threats they face, and a wealth of bird-related information. A photography exhibition on the birders of Wayanad is also part of the event.

Renowned ornithologists presented sessions on ‘Global Ornithological History’ (C. Sasikumar, ornithologist and chairman of Humes); ‘A Brief History of Indian Ornithology’ (Dr. Pramod P., Senior Principal Scientist at the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History); ‘Bird Monitoring via Citizen Science in India’ (Dr. Roshnath Ramesh, State Coordinator of the Heronry Surveys in Kerala); and ‘Bird Monitoring via Citizen Science in India’ (Ashwin Viswanathan, Research Associate at the Nature Conservation Foundation).

“Whoever may have committed it, the act of setting fire to the sugarcane-laden tractors in front of the sugar factory in Sameerwadi is condemnable,” KRRS leader Badagalapura Nagendra said in a statement here.

He said the farmers had been holding a peaceful demonstration demanding payment of pending sugarcane dues as well as a fair price for the last 15 days. The farmers in Mudhol, Haveri, and Bidar had continued their protest opposing the price fixed by the government on November 8.

He accused the government of displaying negligence by failing to call the protesting farmers of these districts and the management of the sugar factories for a discussion to resolve the issue. “It is this negligent attitude of the government that has led to such an incident,” Mr. Nagendra said in the statement.

The KRRS has requested the farmers and protestors to continue their agitation in a peaceful manner while appealing to them to remain alert and give no room for any mischief of unlawful acts.

Judicial probe

Contending that the farmers’ leaders, who were in the forefront of the agitation in Mudhol, were ‘sensible, well-informed, and committed to non-violent methods of struggle’, the KRRS leader said, according to information available, it was unlikely that the protestors were themselves responsible for the incident relating to setting fire to the sugarcane-laden truck.

“Prima facie, it appears that there is a conspiracy and involvement of vetted interests behind it. Reports also suggest that the act may have been carried out by individuals associated with the sugar factory’s management”, he alleged while urging the government to order a judicial probe to identify the miscreants behind the condemnable incident.

Mr Badagalapura also urged the government to immediately invite the protestors of Bagalkote, Haveri, and Bidar, along with the sugar factory owners of the regions, to hold discussions and resolve the issue.

He also said the Union government was trying to evade responsibility by claiming that the sugarcane issue raised by the farmers was not related to it.

Union Minister for Food and Public Distribution Pralhad Joshi, who is an elected representative, must intervene immediately and help find a solution to the imbroglio.

Police said Muthukrishnan, 26, of V.M. Chathram here, who had gone to fill-up the chest in the ATM machine at Vaeinthaankulam new bus-stand on last Wednesday, had parked his bike near the first platform. When he returned after 45 minutes, he found that his two-wheeler had been stolen.

As Mr. Muthukrishnan alerted the policemen in the bus-stand, the police started checking the CCTV cameras fitted near the scene of crime. Even as the police were trying to identify the culprits, two unidentified persons were bringing back Mr. Muthukrishnan’s bike to the spot where they took the two-wheeler. On seeing the police, the duo parked the bike at a distance and tried to flee. However, they were nabbed immediately.

During inquiry, they, who were identified as bike mechanic Muthukumar, 30, of Sattankulam and his associate Thangaraja, 37, of Nanguneri, told the police that as there was no fuel in the bike, they had to bring it back to the spot where they stole the vehicle in a bid to hide the theft.

Additionally, seventeen mobile phones, thirteen bank passbooks, six cheque books, 52 ATM cards and 16 SIM cards and six Aadhaar cards were seized.

The police said that the accused no. 1 in the case R. Narasimha alias Naveen (35) of Shivamogga (Karnataka) is a business management graduate, who used to collect bank account details through social media groups (Telegram), get mule accounts opened and transfer the deposited amounts to crypto currency or cash. Piyush Teli (25) of Rajasthan, the A2, is a graduate having prior work experience in Dubai, has wide knowledge of funds transfer for large amounts.

The complainant Veera Reddy, a retired government official, got a video call seven months ago from anonymous persons posing as CBI officials, accusing him of complicity in a crime “currently under investigation by the CBI”. They also demanded money to be paid into a government account, to be returned after he was proven innocent.

Immaculate backdrop

The victim was hoodwinked by the immaculate backdrop resembling the interiors of a posh police station and the culprits appearing in police uniforms. Even a court scene was recreated, where a judge warned him of arrest within 24 hours. Panicked by the illusory scenes on the video, the senior citizen transferred ₹30 lakh to various accounts, which vanished in no time. The victim approached the local police station after the accused stopped responding to his calls.

Superintendent of Police Shelke Nachiket Vishwanath, who produced the accused at a media conference here on Friday, called upon the public not to panic if they received calls on ‘digital arrest’, as there was no such procedure in law.

“Cyber crime fraudsters find it easy to apply the digital arrest modus operandi on senior citizens, who are an easy prey, considering their age, lack of understanding of the evolving technological jargon and the presence of unguarded funds in savings bank accounts,” he said.

Mr. Vishwanath appreciated the Additional Superintendent (Admin) K. Prakash Babu, Deputy Superintendent (Pulivendula) B. Murali, Circle Inspectors Narasimhulu (Vempalle) and A.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice C.M. Poonacha issued the direction on the petition filed by Y. Karthik, 27, who suffers from visual impairment and cerebral palsy, and his brother, Y. Kaushik, 27, along with their father, Y.M. Satish, who is a MLC.

Despite the passage of nearly a decade since the new enactment, the State government has failed to operationalise several of the core provisions and key statutory obligations like ensuring reservation in employment, identifying posts, implementing social security schemes, establishing a dedicated PwD fund, and providing institutional support at the district and taluk levels remained unfulfilled, it has been complained.

Referring to a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India on performance audit in implementation of the Act, and other documents, it has been contended in the petition that delay in implementation of the provisions of the law has deprived PwDs access to welfare schemes, employment, and social protections guaranteed through this legislation.

While seeking directions for effective implementation of various provisions of the Act, the petitioners have sought specific directions for constituting State Fund for PwD, issue Unique Disability Identity to all eligible persons, and cancel UDID issued to ineligible persons, to ensure that teachers educating PwDs are registered under the Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992, establish special training centre to promote vocational training for PwDs and provide sufficient infrastructure for PwDs in all schools, increase pension for PwDs, among other pleas.

Meanwhile, it has been made it clear in the petition that Mr. Satish, who has set up various facilities for the benefit of PwDs besides making donations to private and non-government organisations working for the welfare of PwDs, is not seeking any benefit from the schemes of the government for his son as he is financially capable of looking after his needs.

Chandrababu Naidu and Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Friday virtually laid the foundation stone for the proposed Drone City and Space City projects in the Rayalaseema region, on the sidelines of the 30th CII Partnership Summit in Visakhapatnam.

Drone City will be developed on 300 acres at Orvakal in Kurnool district, with facilities for drone design, manufacturing, services, and R&D at global standards. It will feature advanced manufacturing parks, testing and certification centres, and training facilities for 25,000 drone pilots. The project is expected to create over 40,000 direct and indirect jobs. The State will offer incentives including a 20% capital subsidy and 100% SGST refund.

Twin Space Cities will come up in Sri Sathya Sai and Tirupati districts — the first of their kind in the country — to boost private-sector participation in the Indian space ecosystem. They will focus on satellite prototyping, space-tech startup incubation, component manufacturing, and launch logistics support. Space City is projected to attract ₹25,000 crore in investments and generate over 35,000 jobs in the next decade. The State has earmarked ₹100 crore under the Space Tech Fund as part of A.P. Space Policy 4.0.

Mr. Goyal said there is significant demand for drones and that Andhra Pradesh had seized the opportunity by conceptualising Drone City. Drawing a parallel with Mr. Naidu’s early push for Information Technology, he said the Chief Minister was now steering the State towards emerging sectors such as drones, space, AI, and quantum technologies. He credited Mr. Naidu with establishing the country’s first Drone City and Space City and said the Chief Minister and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were working together for national and State development.

He appreciated Mr. Naidu’s role in the growth of India’s IT sector during the era of undivided Andhra Pradesh. Referring to drones’ contribution in Operation Sindoor, he highlighted the need for India to become self-reliant in producing high-quality drones, adding that the Kurnool facility would be pivotal in achieving that goal. He also welcomed the plan for a Space City near Sriharikota, India’s rocket-launching hub.

Mr. Goyal endorsed the State’s move to create an escrow account to ensure 100% SGST refunds and 20% capital investment reimbursements, describing it as a transparent mechanism free from political or bureaucratic interference.

He concluded that the Prime Minister’s vision of a drone in every farmer’s field and a smartphone for every Indian would be realised under Swarna Andhra 2047 and Viksit Bharat 2047.",2025-11-14T17:26:02.270742

Kavitha took a sharp dig at her former party’s leadership following its defeat in the Jubilee Hills Assembly byelection, remarking that ‘karma hits back’.

Her comment, posted on ‘X’ soon after the results were declared, triggered a fresh round of speculation about deepening rifts and also Ms. Kavitha’s serious differences with her family’s party, which is now literally being headed by her brother K.T. Rama Rao in the silence of BRS chief K. Chandrashekhar Rao.

The cryptic post is being widely interpreted as an indirect attack on her brother and former Minister Mr. K.T. Rama Rao. Ms. Kavitha feels Mr. Rama Rao was either responsible for her suspension or chose not to defend her when she was targeted by her cousins. Her remark, therefore, is seen as a calculated attempt to underscore the party’s decline in her absence.

Ms. Kavitha’s reaction reflects a sense of ‘revenge satisfaction’ rather than mere political commentary. Her post suggests that she considers the bypoll outcome a vindication of her belief that she played a significant role within the party and that her exclusion contributed to its setbacks.

The poll outcome added to the turmoil within the BRS, which has been grappling with internal dissension since its loss in the 2023 Assembly elections.

Addressing the media at his residence in Hyderabad, Mr. Owaisi said that his party respects the people’s verdict in Bihar. He offered his congratulations and good wishes to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, and said the party would work for the development of the State, as there was work to be done in the fields of creating employment and developing public infrastructure . He reiterated that Seemanchal’s long standing demands for justice and development would remain at the core of his party’s work. “We will not leave Seemanchal,” he said.

Revanth Reddy had thanked him and that he had conveyed his congratulations in return. He described the win as a significant achievement after the 2023 elections.

Commenting on political developments in Bihar, Mr. Owaisi said he had consistently maintained that the Rashtriya Janata Dal could not halt the advance of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Issuing a word of caution to the electors of that State, he said that they were under a misconception surrounding the Muslim-Yadav combination. He urged the community to move beyond being mere participants in electoral politics and instead become active political stakeholders.

He also said the reduction in the Bharat Rashtra Samithi’s vote share had been evident from the beginning,. He hoped that the Telangana CM Revanth Reddy would work towards improving civic amenities in Hyderabad, including improvements to sewage networks and water supply, particularly for those belonging to weaker sections of society.

Addressing party workers at the BJP headquarters in Delhi on Friday evening, PM Modi said after Bihar, BJP will next uproot the ""jungle raj"" in Bengal.

As per the Bihar Assembly elections results announced by the Election Commission on Friday, the NDA was crossing the 200-mark, ensuring a 2/3rd majority.

""Ganga flows through Bihar and reaches Bengal. Bihar has also paved the way for the BJP's victory in Bengal. I also congratulate the brothers and sisters of Bengal. Now, together with you, the BJP will uproot jungle raj from West Bengal as well,"" PM Modi said amid a rousing roar from thousands of party workers that were present during the celebrations.

With the Assembly elections to the 293 seats of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, will be held in 2026, the BJP and the Trinamool are likely to fight around the issues of women's safety, law and order situation, infiltration from Bangladesh, and Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral roll, among others.

The SIR holds special significance in the run-up to the high-stake Bengal polls next year as it aims to flush out illegal voters from the electoral roll, an issue that has become a bone of contention between the two rival parties in the state.

Notably, SIR 1.0 was successfully carried out in Bihar, resulting in the removal of around 65 lakh fake voters from the state's voter list. The Mahagathbandhan vehemently opposed the drive, alleging it deliberately targeted the voter-base favouring them.

PM'S 'PARASITE' ATTACK ON CONGRESS

Continuing his tirade against Opposition party, PM Modi slammed the Congress, calling it a ""parasite party"", who harms its allies during elections. PM Modi warned that the allies should think twice before tying up with the Congress.

""Even the Congress allies are beginning to understand that the Congress is drowning everyone in its negative politics. That is why, during the Bihar elections, I said that the 'naamdar' of the Congress is practising to drown himself and others in the Bihar elections by taking a dip in the pond,"" PM Modi asserted.

""I have previously warned Congress allies from this very platform. I said that Congress is a liability. Congress is a parasite that wants to make a comeback by swallowing the vote bank of its allies,"" he added.

The BJP's perennial star campaigner also said the Congress has turned into what he termed the ""Muslim League–Maoist Congress,"" arguing that the party’s agenda now centres around these influences.

He added that a section within the Congress is uneasy with what he called its negative style of politics and warned that this internal discomfort could eventually lead to another major split in the party.

Earlier, the numbers released by the poll panel showed that the NDA – comprising the Nitish Kumar-led JDU, the BJP, Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (Ramvilas), and Upendra Kushwaha's RLSP – was on its way to register a landslide victory with over 200 seats.

The Mahagathbandhan of the RJD, Congress and other partners were reduced to less than 30 seats.

This is the NDA's best ever tally in Bihar, with the BJP all set to emerge as the single-largest party in the state for the first time.

What began as an early lead soon turned into a runaway surge, placing the Nitish Kumar-led alliance on the brink of its most dominant performance in the state.

Counting began at 8 am, and postal ballots immediately swung the momentum towards the NDA. Within hours, trends showed the BJP, which had insisted on equal seat-sharing, opening up a significant lead over the JD(U). The saffron party’s strong showing has now triggered speculation over who will play the “big brother” in the alliance going forward.

For the opposition, the election proved disastrous. Tejashwi Yadav’s RJD, which emerged as the single-largest party last time, crumbled under the NDA wave, losing more than half its seats. The Congress struggled yet again, reinforcing its status as the Mahagathbandhan’s weakest link. Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party, touted in some quarters as a possible disruptor, ended up “farsh par”, failing to make any electoral dent.

Exit polls had indicated an NDA edge, but the extent of the sweep, with both BJP and JD(U) clocking massive gains, exceeded most projections. With the BJP clearly outperforming its ally, attention has shifted to the next big question: Will Nitish Kumar take oath as chief minister for a record tenth time, or will an assertive BJP push to claim the top post?

Here's the latest on the Bihar Assembly elections results: The NDA has strengthened its lead in Bihar, with BJP winning 80 seats and JD(U) 67, giving the alliance 147 victories. RJD trails at 20 seats, LJP(RV) has 16, and Congress 6. Smaller parties, including AIMIM, HAMS, and others, have a handful of wins. With 205 seats decided, the NDA is set for a decisive mandate.

Despite high hopes, Prashant Kishor’s party failed to win any seats in Bihar, with most candidates likely to forfeit deposits. Kishor had predicted JD(U) would win “not more than 25 seats,” but the party is set to cross 80, its best performance since 2010. Once a celebrated strategist behind multiple initiatives, Bihar polls mark a major setback for his leadership ambitions.

BJP emerged as the NDA’s “big brother,” while Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) followed. Strong support from Modi and Union ministers boosted the alliance. Junior partners, Chirag Paswan’s LJP(RV), Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM, and Upendra Kushwaha’s RLM, showed strong leads. advertisement

In the Mahagathbandhan camp, RJD, the only party in double digits, has 20 wins. Congress wins 6 seats in Bihar election. Left parties like CPI(M) and CPI(ML)(L) are ahead by 1–2 seats each, while the Indian Inclusive Party (IIP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) each have 1 lead.

Lalu Yadav's prodigal son Tej Pratap, who floated his own party (Jan Shakti Janata Dal), concedes defeat in Mahua, praising Bihar voters for choosing a government committed to good governance. In a twist, his estranged brother Tejashwi Yadav maintains a solid lead in Raghopur.

advertisement If the trends hold, Nitish Kumar, written off by many before the campaign began, could return as chief minister for a record fifth term. But with the BJP once again outperforming the JD(U), pushback is inevitable. Meanwhile, BJP and JD(U) workers play drums, burst firecrackers, and chant slogans. JD(U) supporters hold posters reading “Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai.”

The NDA's commanding show indicates a 'Nimo' wave (Nitish Kumar + Narendra Modi). The JD(U) chief’s social-welfare plank, backed by a record turnout of women voters, buoyed the party across key constituencies. PM Modi, a perennial vote magnet, front-loaded an aggressive campaign blitz in the run-up to the polls, sharpening attacks on the RJD with the “jungle raaj” refrain.

Prime Minister Modi celebrated the NDA’s historic Bihar win, calling it a “resounding mandate.” Highlighting women and youth, he said the old “MY” (Muslim-Yadav) formula has been replaced by a new, positive MY – Mahila and Youth, whose aspirations and dreams have overturned the old politics of appeasement.

advertisement In a dramatic twist in the Bihar election tally, Raghopur Assembly Result: Tejashwi Yadav has retained his Raghopur seat, securing 1.18 lakh votes in the 32nd and final round of counting. He defeated BJP’s Satish Kumar, who received 1.04 lakh votes, with a winning margin of 14,532 votes in a closely watched and high-stakes contest.

Chirag Paswan’s LJP(RV) has surprised everyone, winning 17 seats and leading in 2 more, taking its tally to 19. Calling himself the PM’s “Hanuman,” Chirag’s strong comeback gives him significant political leverage, potentially even to claim a deputy chief minister’s post.

Cut down to 2025, a new equation seems to have emerged - MY (mahila and youth and EBC) - that has resulted in the NDA securing a decisive mandate in the Bihar elections. A new arithmetic, defined by social welfare, gender, and aspirations, seems to have clicked for the NDA in Bihar, where elections have been largely seen through the caste lens.

advertisement

The NDA's Bihar campaign rested on three factors: the women's vote and Nitish's appeal among them, caste arithmetic boosted by the return of Chirag Paswan and Upendra Kushwaha, and the youth, who were reminded repeatedly by the NDA of the 'katta, dunali, rangdari' (lawlessness) that prevailed during previous RJD regimes.

The Mahagathbandhan, on the other hand, failed to broaden its caste bouquet beyond Muslims and Yadavs, and its campaign centred around ""vote chori"" failed to strike a chord with the voters. In fact, analysis shows that the NDA also weaned away a chunk of 'MY' voters.

THE CASTE ARITHMETIC

The elections have firmly established that the Bihar of 1995, when the Muslim-Yadav equation ruled the roost, is not the Bihar of 2025.

The NDA, this time, had a wider caste umbrella. The BJP had its upper caste base, while Nitish consolidated EBC support, which has emerged as the X factor in recent elections. The Rashtriya Lok Morcha's Kushwahas, the LJP's Paswans and Hindustani Awam Morcha (S)'s Dalit backing all seem to have aligned perfectly for the NDA.

The EBCs seem to have played a key role behind the NDA's surge from the 2020 polls, where it managed to form the government by a slim margin. The caste survey data released by the Nitish government revealed that EBCs constitute 36% of the population.

The NDA and Nitish, who is from the Kurmi community (around 3% of the population), seem to have consolidated this base through welfare measures targeting EBCs.

It marks a stunning turnaround for the JD(U), which lost over three dozen seats that had a substantial EBC and SC population in the 2020 elections. The JD(U) won only 43 out of the 115 seats it contested. This time, its tally is well over 70.

Strategic caste calculations were also key. For example, in regions like Magadh and Shahabad, the NDA sent Bhojpuri actor Pawan Singh to campaign and along with Upendra Kushwaha's influence, it united the Rajput and Kushwaha vote banks.

WOMEN VOTERS

Over the past five years, women have emerged as a new vote bank in Bihar that appears to be voting on more than just identity and caste issues.

Since 2010, women's turnout has consistently risen. In 2025, the turnout among women voters was 10% higher than men, and the results have shown that they continue to be Nitish's biggest cheerleaders.

advertisement

In fact, since Nitish took charge of the state in 2005, he has cultivated women as a separate vote bank - from introducing a slew of policies, free bicycles for school girls to bringing a liquor prohibition law.

This time, it was the ""dashazari"" scheme or the Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which women entrepreneurs are eligible to receive Rs 10,000, that made them vote en masse for the NDA. Complementing this was the 'Lakhpati Didi' programme to foster women's entrepreneurship.

It has shown that the 'M' in Bihar's political narrative is no longer about Muslims or religion, but about mahila power.

During the campaign, several NDA leaders framed the contest as one between ""dashazari chunaav"" and ""katta sarkar"" (Contest between Rs 10,000 sop for women and a lawless government, referring to the RJD).

THE NITISH FACTOR

The third factor that fuelled the NDA's surge is Nitish Kumar himself, whose 'Sushashan Babu' and corruption-free image became the bloc's biggest asset.

At 74, Nitish remains relevant more than ever in Bihar's political landscape, shouldering the weight of the NDA's campaign. According to a report, the JD(U) supremo attended 84 rallies, just one fewer than 39-year-old Tejashwi.

advertisement

Thus, Tejashwi's ploy of attacking his erstwhile boss over his health and calling his government ""khatara"" (rickety) did not strike a chord with the voters who saw Nitish criss-cross the state.

Moreover, the free electricity given to all domestic consumers till 125 units and enhancing the old-age pension for senior citizens from Rs 400 to Rs 1,100 proved to be a game-changer.

It brought Nitish Kumar back in the reckoning among people as Bihar's 'Sushashan Babu'.

This time, the defeat came from one of India's most politically crucial states—Bihar—with the Congress' main leader, Rahul Gandhi, nowhere to be seen.

There were rumours that he was last spotted with his niece Miraya Vadra, daughter of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, at London's Heathrow Airport. But Congress leaders Supriya Shrinate and Ragini Nayak shot down the claims, saying the viral video of Gandhi and his niece dates back to September.

advertisement

So, where exactly is the Leader of the Opposition, the supposed main face of the Congress in Bihar?

As the NDA is heading towards a landslide victory in Bihar, the internet and social media are flooded with memes and questions: Where is Rahul Gandhi?

Rumours suggested that he had jetted off to London or Muscat. But according to fact-check site NewsMeter, there's no official word from the Congress or any credible media confirming Gandhi's flight to London or the Middle East.

For now, nobody has a clue where the General is while his Army crumbles.

As poll results rolled in on Friday, BJP national spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said, ""By the time Rahul Gandhi wakes up in a different time zone abroad, the NDA would have lifted the trophy here."" He also implied that Rahul Gandhi was abroad, but did not provide any proof to back his claim.

RAHUL BIHAR BID CRASHED HARD

The fact the Left parties, CPI (ML) (L) and CPI (M), and the AIMIM, are leading in more seats than the Grand Old Party speaks for itself.

To be fair, Rahul Gandhi did mount a massive push in Bihar alongside his Mahagathbandhan ally, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav. His Vote Adhikar Yatra covered 23 districts over 1,300 km in 16 days. The focus was on voter rights and chats with the locals.

It did seemingly rile up the NDA's double-engine in the state, but as it turned out, grassroots connect doesn't happen in a fortnight, especially in a state like Bihar. Here, a tussle came out. While Tejashwi Yadav was talking about jobs and employment, Rahul kept harping on vote theft allegations and the SIR exercise.

Cracking the mindset of India's most backward state, where the average monthly income stands at just Rs 5,700, can't be fixed with the echo-chamber wisdom, no matter how polished, sensible, or realistic it might sound.

Then came the heat of the actual poll campaign, when heavyweights like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar were doing back-to-back rallies. Rahul Gandhi suddenly vanished from the scene then.

His Vote Adhikar Yatra wrapped on September 1, after which Gandhi went on a five-nation tour in South America. Then came his H-Bomb, or Hydrogen Bomb: a big presser on ""vote theft"", but it never detonated.

advertisement

When Gandhi could have used the faint buzz from his Colombia visit and his ""vote chori"" press conference, he suddenly disappeared from the scene.

He somewhat proved what critics like Jan Suraaj's Prashant Koshor have long said: ""These (Delhi leaders) are seasonal birds who only flap in Bihar during polls.""

It must be noted that Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj appears to have eaten into the Mahagathbandhan's votes. The Election Commission of India shows 13% votes under ""others"", which includes Kishor's party that contested all 243 seats for the first time, even as Jan Suraaj does not find a separate mention on the poll website.

Rahul Gandhi is a big leader, but seemingly not so much in Bihar. His absence and his complete silence following Mahagathbandhan's loss suggests as much.

Focusing on the role of women and youth in shaping the outcome, PM Modi said, “Some parties in Bihar had created the appeasement formula of MY. But today’s victory has given a new positive MY formula, and that is Mahila and Youth. Today, Bihar is among those states of the country which have the highest number of youth, and this includes youth from every religion and every caste. Their desire, their aspiration and their dreams have completely destroyed the old communal MY formula of the Jungle Raj people.”

He also expressed gratitude to voters in Nagrota in Jammu and Kashmir and Nuapada in Odisha, saying, “They have ensured the BJP’s victory in the by-elections. Today is not just a victory for the NDA, it is also a victory for democracy. It is a victory for those who believe in Indian democracy. This election has further strengthened the public’s trust in the Election Commission of India.”

CHHATH MAIYA AND BIHAR’S PRIDE

Starting his speech, PM Modi said, “Jai Chhathi Maiya, this is a massive victory, an unbreakable trust, the people of Bihar have completely blown everyone away.”

He added, “We are the servants of the people. We keep making the people happy with our hard work and we have stolen the hearts of the people. And that is why the entire Bihar has said ‘Phir ek baar NDA Sarkar’.”

Modi reaffirmed his stance on Jungle Raj and Katta Sarkar, saying, “When I used to speak about Jungle Raj and Katta Sarkar in Bihar elections, the RJD party raised no objections. But it hurt the people of Congress. Today, I want to reiterate that Katta Sarkar will never return to Bihar. The people of Bihar have voted for a developed and prosperous Bihar.”

PM MODI ON BIHAR’S MANDATE

PM Modi emphasised Bihar’s culture and traditions, saying, “To date, Congress and RJD have not apologised to Chhathi Maiya. The people of Bihar will never forget this. Bihar's pride and honour, this is our priority.”

He added, “The people of Bihar have played a huge role in India's development. But those who ruled the country for decades always created a false image of Bihar. These people defamed Bihar. They neither respected Bihar's glorious past, nor its traditions and culture, nor its people.”

Modi also spoke about the government’s efforts to preserve Chhath, saying, “Our government is striving to include Chhath in the UNESCO Heritage List. The goal is to connect the entire country and the world with this culture through its significance.”

He recalled the record voter turnout, saying, “During the election campaign, I had urged the people of Bihar for record voting, and the people of Bihar have broken all records. I had urged the people of Bihar to ensure a resounding victory for the NDA, and the people of Bihar have honoured this request of mine.”

'STRONGEST MANDATE SINCE 2010'

Modi described the mandate as Bihar’s strongest since 2010, saying, “After 2010, Bihar has delivered its strongest mandate to the NDA. I wholeheartedly thank the people of Bihar for their support on behalf of all the parties within the NDA.”

He also praised the peaceful voting, saying, “This election has further strengthened the public’s trust in the Election Commission of India. The consistently high voter turnout over the past few years, the increased turnout by the deprived and the exploited, is a significant achievement for the Election Commission. This is the same Bihar that was once dominated by Maoist terror. Voting used to end at 3 pm in Naxal-affected areas. But in this election, people in Bihar have voted without fear, with enthusiasm and excitement. You also know what used to happen in Bihar during the times of Jungle Raj. Violence used to occur openly at polling stations. Ballot boxes were looted. Today, the same Bihar is seeing record voter turnout. It is voting peacefully. Everyone’s vote has been recorded. Everyone has cast their vote as per their choice.”

He described Bihar as a symbol of democracy, saying, “Bihar is the land that gave India the pride of being the mother of democracy. Today, the same land has crushed the forces that tried to attack democracy. Bihar has once again shown, ‘Lies lose, public trust wins.’ The people have decisively rejected those relying on false promises and criminal elements.”

RECORD VICTORIES ACROSS STATES

Reflecting on NDA’s electoral success nationally, Modi also said, “Last year, the people of the country gave their mandate to the NDA for the third consecutive time. This was the result of the nation's trust and the blessings of the countrymen. And after the Lok Sabha elections, we also won assembly elections in many states with a resounding majority. Haryana, the land that promoted the spirit of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, gave us the opportunity to serve for the third consecutive time. We won a resounding victory in Maharashtra, the holy land of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Babasaheb Ambedkar, and Veer Savarkar. Maharashtra made us victorious for the third consecutive time. We won with a majority in the national capital after 25 years. And today, in Bihar, where such a large population lives in rural areas, we have won with such overwhelming numbers.”

PEACEFUL VOTING AND END OF REPOLLING

On Bihar’s smooth election process, Modi said, “Earlier, there was no election in Bihar where repolling did not take place. For instance, before 2005, repolling happened at hundreds of places. In 1995, repolling took place at more than 1500 polling stations. But as the jungle raj ended, the situation started improving, and in both phases of this election, there was no need for repolling anywhere. This time, the voting was peaceful.”

He added, “During 'Jungal Raj' in Bihar, polling booths used to be vandalised openly, ballot boxes used to be stolen... Now, the same Bihar is witnessing record voting.”

MANDATE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND REJECTION OF NEPOTISM

PM Modi called the results a clear endorsement of development politics, saying, “This victory is a mandate for politics of development and rejection of politics of nepotism. This is a victory for the women of Bihar who had to face wrath of RJD's 'jungle raj'. Bihar verdict has rejected politics of appeasement and replaced it with fulfilment for all. Bihar has proved that people defeat falsehoods and do not support those who are out on bail. Bihar voters have given massive support to SIR, it is now duty of all parties to activate their workers to purify voter lists.”

END OF BOOTH CAPTURING AND FEAR IN VOTING

Highlighting the transformation in Bihar’s elections, Modi said, “Booth capturing, violence used to be a regular affair during 'jungle raj' in Bihar elections, but now no such case takes place. There was a time when voting was restricted till 3 pm in areas affected by Naxals, but now people voted without fear. I congratulate people for reposing faith in democracy and Election Commission by voting in record numbers.”

OPPOSITION CRITICISM AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

PM Modi criticised the Opposition and reinforced Bihar’s focus on development, saying, “How can those who call Chhath Puja as 'drama' respect traditions of Bihar? They (RJD) used to say that Bihar doesn’t need industry, train and airports. This victory is a mandate for ‘Vikasvaad’ against ‘Vanshvaad’. People of Bihar have played a huge role in the development of Bihar.”

He also stressed voter awareness, saying, “The Bihar elections have validated that our voters, especially the youth, take the accuracy of the voters’ list very seriously. The people of Bihar have shown strong support for an updated voters’ list.”

BIHAR VICTORY SENDS MESSAGE TO WEST BENGAL

PM Modi also highlighted the broader impact of Bihar’s mandate on neighbouring states, particularly West Bengal, saying, ""Ganga flows through Bihar and reaches Bengal. Bihar has also paved the way for the BJP's victory in Bengal. I also congratulate the brothers and sisters of Bengal. Now, together with you, the BJP will uproot jungle raj from West Bengal as well.""

He added, ""Today’s win has energized BJP workers in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Assam, and West Bengal. And yes, as the Ganga flows from Bihar to Bengal, Bihar has also paved the way for the BJP’s victory in Bengal. I assure my brothers and sisters in Bengal that the BJP, together with you, will uproot ‘Jungle Raj’ from West Bengal as well.""

PM Modi also launched a sharp critique of the Congress, saying, ""Even the Congress allies are beginning to understand that the Congress is drowning everyone in its negative politics. That is why, during the Bihar elections, I said that the 'naamdar' of the Congress is practising to drown himself and others in the Bihar elections by taking a dip in the pond.""

He warned, ""I have previously warned Congress allies from this very platform. I said that Congress is a liability. Congress is a parasite that wants to make a comeback by swallowing the vote bank of its allies.""

Modi further elaborated on the internal situation within Congress, saying, ""Today, the Congress has become MMC- Muslim League Maoist Congress and the entire agenda of the Congress now revolves around this, and therefore, within the Congress as well, a separate faction is emerging that is uncomfortable with this negative politics...I fear that there could be another major split in the Congress.""

Reiterating Bihar’s democratic legacy and the significance of peaceful voting, he said, ""...Bihar is the land that has given India the pride of being the mother of democracy...Bihar has once again shown that lies lose, people's trust wins. Bihar has made it clear that people will not support those who are out on bail.""

He also noted the improvement in electoral conduct, ""Earlier, there was no election in Bihar where repolling did not take place. For instance, before 2005, repolling happened at hundreds of places.

JP NADDA ON NDA’S LANDSLIDE

Calling the results a “tsunami” in favour of the NDA, JP Nadda said, “These results indicate that whether it is the people of Bihar or the people of the country, everyone has unwavering faith in the Prime Minister. This mandate endorses the politics of development.”

He added, “The grand alliance was doing politics by dividing society; their strategy was to rule Bihar not with Biharis, but with the help of outsiders. The people of Bihar have given them a befitting reply and sent a clear message that the people of Bihar stand with nationalist forces.”

In a post on X, Rahul Gandhi said the Opposition would intensify its fight to “protect the Constitution and democracy”.

“I express my heartfelt gratitude to those millions of voters in Bihar who expressed their trust in the Mahagathbandhan. This result in Bihar is truly surprising. We could not achieve victory in an election that was not fair from the very beginning,” he wrote.

Calling the Bihar verdict a setback that warrants introspection, Gandhi said the Congress and the INDIA bloc would “deeply review” the results and strengthen their efforts going forward. “This fight is for the protection of the Constitution and democracy. The Congress Party and the INDIA alliance will deeply review this result and make their efforts to save democracy even more effective,” he added.

The NDA, led by the BJP and JDU, is set for a historic win, while the Congress recorded one of its worst performances in the state since 2010. Meanwhile, other Congress leaders issued a series of unusually candid reactions, calling the verdict “unexpected,” “unacceptable,” and reflective of deep organisational failures.

SERIOUSLY DISAPPONTING: THAROOR

Shashi Tharoor, speaking in Thiruvananthapuram, said the numbers were “seriously disappointing” and demanded a thorough review. “There will have to be some very serious introspection — not just sitting and thinking, but studying what went wrong, what the tactical, messaging or organisational mistakes were,” he said. Tharoor noted he had not been invited to campaign in Bihar and therefore could only rely on discussions with colleagues.

VOTE CHORI ON GIGANTIC SCALE: JAIRAM RAMESH

Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh took an even sharper line, alleging large-scale manipulation. “Without doubt, the election results in Bihar reflect vote chori on a gigantic scale — masterminded by the PM, the HM, and the Election Commission,” he posted on X. He added that the party would intensify its campaign to “save democracy.”

NOT THE PEOPLE'S MANDATE: PRIYANK KHARGE

Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge termed the outcome “extremely surprising” and “unacceptable.” He said the results did not reflect the assessments made on the ground, adding, “This is not the people’s mandate.” He called for a detailed examination of how such a verdict emerged.

A string of Congress leaders also voiced internal criticisms, signalling deeper organisational unease after the rout.

DECISION-MAKING IN A FEW HANDS: MUMTAZ PATEL

Congress leader Mumtaz Patel issued one of the strongest internal critiques, arguing that the party had failed both in organisation and in recognising its own grassroots workers.

“When we know we are fighting a system that has complete control, the Congress party has to be alert,” she said. “Decision-making is concentrated in the hands of a few people Those familiar with the ground are not given a chance. No one asks them, no one acknowledges them.”

She added that while the party speaks about defending democracy nationally, it must also ensure internal accountability. Patel said the party needs to “win people’s hearts and trust again,” adding that Rahul Gandhi is working hard but is undermined by “a few within our party who manipulate power.”

She also suggested that if opposition parties believe the electoral process is compromised, they should collectively consider a stronger response, even hinting at an election boycott.

SHAKEEL AHMAD FLAGS TICKET IRREGULARITIES, AIMIM GAINS

Former Bihar minister Shakeel Ahmad, now outside the Congress, pointed to long-standing allegations over ticket distribution. “Immediately after ticket distribution, several senior Congress leaders held a press conference and alleged financial irregularities and other issues,” he said.

He added that AIMIM’s lead on more seats than the Congress was “shocking.” Citing the party’s past performance, he said the rise of Asaduddin Owaisi’s party indicated that the Muslim electorate in Seemanchal “must have felt they were winning strongly and wanted to prevent a third party from winning.”

The photo, many social media users believed, infamously refers to the ""cauliflower burial case"" or the Logain massacre, a brutal incident that occurred during the 1989 Bhagalpur communal riots in Bihar.

Over 100 Muslims were killed, their bodies buried in a field with cauliflower saplings planted over them to hide the evidence.

Since then, images of cauliflowers have often been used to evoke the Logain massacre. Recently, in March 2025, amid the Nagpur violence, some right-wing social media handles shared images of cauliflowers. In May 2025, Karnataka BJP's official account on X posted a meme celebrating the killing of Maoists in Chhattisgarh, which also carried the cauliflower reference.

The Assam Minister's post left social media users in disbelief over the sheer reference to the brutal massacre. One user, giving context, wrote, “Context: The image of a cauliflower field posted by BJP's Assam minister has been used by Hindu extremists to glorify the mass killing of Muslims in Bhagalpur in 1989, with cauliflowers planted on the burial site to hide evidence.”

One user commented, “No way this coming from a cabinet minister of Assam.” Another wrote, “Is this an official handle bcoz no way they just said that.” A third comment read, “What?? Really? I thought this is a parody account.”

WHAT HAPPENED IN LOGAN

The violence began on 24 October 1989 and continued for two months, engulfing Bhagalpur city and 250 surrounding villages. Over 1,000 people were killed, around 900 of them Muslims, and another 50,000 were displaced. It was the worst instance of Hindu-Muslim violence in independent India at the time.

At the village of Logain, 116 Muslims were reportedly killed by a 4,000-strong mob. Their bodies were buried and covered with cauliflower and cabbage saplings to conceal the deaths. AK Singh, IAS, then Bhagalpur’s special ADM (law and order), was the officer who uncovered the gruesome crime nearly 25 days after the bodies had been buried.

Rooted in rising tensions around the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, it was one of independent India’s deadliest episodes of communal violence. As the VHP’s Ramshila processions moved through Bhagalpur to collect bricks for the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya, the district was already rife with incendiary rumours alleging the killing of Hindu students. Political and criminal rivalries further sharpened the atmosphere.

The immediate trigger came on 24 October, when a massive Ramshila procession reached the Muslim-dominated Tatarpur area. While an earlier procession had passed peacefully, the second one saw provocative slogans. As officials attempted to negotiate a route, crude bombs were thrown from the nearby Muslim high school, injuring policemen. Police firing followed, killing two people, and the procession quickly turned into a mob that targeted Muslim shops. Retaliatory violence escalated across Bhagalpur, with attacks, arson and killings multiplying over the next days.

Entire localities were ravaged. Massacres unfolded in full public view: 18 Muslims, including 11 children, were butchered inside Bhagalpur’s Nayabazar; 61 bodies were recovered from a pond in Chandheri; and in Logain, 116 Muslims were murdered.

The official toll recorded 1,070 dead, thousands displaced, and widespread destruction of homes, looms and places of worship. Subsequent commissions blamed police inaction and political failures, while decades of trials, acquittals, sporadic convictions and delayed compensation left survivors alleging that justice was neither swift nor complete.

An entire generation of voters, including Gen Z, has not seen Lalu or his RJD in power. Yet, stories of alleged lawlessness and kidnappings during his regime live on. As the NDA again swept to power in the assembly elections, the 'jungle raj' taint against the RJD remains unchanged, and it seems, his son, Tejashwi, is having to bear its brunt.

advertisement

On Friday, as the NDA secured an emphatic victory, routing the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan, several natives from Bihar, mostly 90s kids, flooded social media with their personal memories of Lalu raj. Those who grew up during the turbulent 1990s recounted how lawlessness and the threat of kidnappings shaped their childhoods.

'HAD TO LEAVE HOME AT AGE OF 15'

Another section, who left Bihar years ago, recounted how their families sent them to boarding schools to escape the deteriorating civic order in Lalu Prasad's Bihar.

""Lalu Yadav was the reason why me and countless people like me had to leave home even before the age of 15, first for education and then for jobs. Those who left Bihar grew up while staying away from their parents. Even during festivals, many times we had to stay alone in some hostel,"" a social media user with the username EngiNerd tweeted.

He pointed out that such was the damage Lalu did to Bihar that even after 20 years of anti-incumbency against Nitish, people were coming out in record numbers to prevent the return of the RJD chief and his son.

""This man can't destroy the happiness of two generations of people and have his son become a chief minister and enjoy his family moments. Massive loss of Lalu Yadav in this election is a personal victory for me,"" he further said.

Another user, Ashish Bhutada, recalled seeing people casually roaming around with guns on Bihar streets in 1993 when he went there from Maharashtra.

Another alleged that rapes were common during Lalu's reign. ""It has been left unreported due to fear of lynching by RJD's goons. I am glad that Lalu is alive to see this,"" the user, Saral Nahar, said.

THE ORIGINS OF 'JUNGLE RAJ'

'Jungle raj' became a part of Bihar's political lexicon in 1997 after a judge of the Patna High Court remarked while hearing a petition on poor civic conditions in Patna.

""It is worse than the jungle raj and there is no regard to court directions and public interest,"" the court had said. Since then, the term has stuck to the RJD, and the opposition has revived it in subsequent elections to corner Lalu and his party.

advertisement

One of the most gruesome incidents during Lalu's regime was the killing of around 60 members of the Dalit community by an upper caste group in 1997 in Jehanabad.

The 'jungle raj' term has come to haunt Lalu and his family on several occassions, following his name cropping up in the fodder scam cases and the land-for-jobs scandal.

This year, NDA leaders and Prime Minister Narendra Modi used the narrative to full effect, referring to Tejashwi as ""jungle raj ka yuvraj"" to attack the RJD over lawlessness as well as dynastic politics.

Several Bihar natives also summed up the compromises their families made to ensure their children's safety during Lalu's tenure.

""Thousands of 90s kids who had to live away from their parents in boarding schools just to avoid getting kidnapped, thousands who had to forfeit their ancestral land as a bribe to get a clerical job, millions who studied hard under a lantern or a petromax to somehow escape the jungle raj,"" another user tweeted.

""All of them, across the world, doing well, now looking at their phone screens and the numbers, and smiling. This is victory,"" he further said.

Another user, Savitha Rao, narrated how her friend from Bihar was put in a boarding school at the age of 6.

""He would say that when he went home, his dad's men would come to the station to pick him up. And they would have rifles... Later, I realised those with means were forced to do it to protect their lives,"" Rao tweeted.

Another recounted how he was directed to stay put at the railway station at night despite his train arriving on time.

""I remember being instructed to stay put at the railway station near the RPF post till sunrise. This being the case, when my house was in the same town. I had to stay at the station for 3 hours before my father came to pick me up,"" he said.

It seems, despite 20 years since the end of RJD rule, the people of Bihar have not yet come out of the fear of Lalu Prasad Yadav's 'jungle raj', which is clearly evident from the decisive mandate against the party. It is this distress among the people of Bihar that the NDA pounced on to secure a two-thirds majority.

The slogans that greeted him left him discomfited. Having led the freedom struggle for a few years by then, Gandhi felt the disconnect. He said that despite talks of Hindu-Muslim unity, cries of ""Vande Mataram"" and ""Allahu Akbar"" were hurled by both communities during riots to assert dominance. It only revealed how divided the nation-to-be was, he said.

advertisement

The Vande Mataram slogan, inspired by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's poem, had long been a rallying cry of the nationalists and an ode to the motherland, faced opposition from Muslims, including some in the Congress and the Muslim League. The opposition stemmed from the community's perception of the slogan being idolatrous and anti-Muslim owing to its use in Chatterjee's Anand Math, a fictional novel portraying Hindu monks rising against Muslim rulers of Bengal.

Despite the opposition, some of which lingers to this day, the Congress leadership of Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Rajendra Prasad chose to make Vande Mataram, India's national song, given its immense significance as the soul of the freedom struggle. Only two stanzas of Vande Mataram were adopted. In fact, the original version of Vande Mataram, written in 1875, had only two stanzas, but was later expanded to six stanzas by Chatterjee and included in Anand Math in 1882.

VANDE MATARAM'S CRUCIAL SEVERED WAS INJUSTICE; SEEDS OF INDIA'S DIVISON SOWN IN 1937: MODI

Fast-forward to 2025. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said last week that ""crucial"" verses from ""Vande Mataram"" were removed in 1937, and the song being ""broken and torn into pieces"" had ""sown the seeds of the country's division"".

""The spirit of Vande Mataram illuminated the entire nation during the freedom struggle. But unfortunately, in 1937, crucial verses of Vande Mataram, a part of its soul, were severed. Vande Mataram was broken; it was torn into pieces. This division of Vande Mataram also sowed the seeds of division of the country. It's a great mantra of nation building. Why was this injustice done to it?"" Modi asked, while speaking at an event to celebrate 150 years of Vande Mataram, India's National Song.

BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan accused the Congress of ""deliberately distorting"" Vande Mataram, claiming stanzas hailing Goddess Durga were removed in 1937 to appease communal sensitivities.

But contrary to the BJP's claim, Vande Mataram, despite being the soul of India's freedom struggle, was also considered ""idolatrous"" by certain sections of Muslims in British India, and they fiercely opposed the poem's adaptation as the National Song.

In the 1920s and 1930s, when religious identities hardened and politics grew more exclusionary, the push for adoption of the song by the Congress only deepened the divisiveness. The use of Vande Mataram as a slogan to provoke turned it from a symbol of national pride into a point of contention, noted historian Sabyasachi Bhattacharya in his 2003 book, Vande Mataram, The Biography Of A Song.

""The song that united also divided,"" Bhattacharya wrote. He underlined how, even before the song's adoption in 1937, there were communal frictions over the slogan. The slogan of Vande Mataram was used to irk Muslims during communal tensions, just like Muslims hurled ""Allahu Akbar"". And all this started in the first decade of the 20th century, decades before the Congress adopted it in 1937.

The decision by the Congress to limit the national song Vande Mataram to only its first two stanzas was not a secret abridgement. It was a deliberate, openly recorded resolution made in response to objections raised by Muslim leaders. Moreover, Rabindranath Tagore himself endorsed the shorter version, on the Congress' request.

So, what made Gandhi compare both the slogans—Vande Mataram and Allahu Akbar—and why did Tagore recommend the adoption of the first two paragraphs of the poem for the National Song? What was in the part that was left out?

THE STORY OF VANDE MATARAM; ORIGINS OF THE FIRST TWO STANZAS

The story of Vande Mataram began on November 7, 1875, during the Hindu festival of Akshaya Navami. Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, then a bureaucrat and now Bengal's Sahitya Samrat, penned its first lines. Drawing from the Shakti tradition, he imagined the motherland as a living goddess, akin to Durga or Jagaddhatri, the sustainer of the universe.

""Vande Mataram, sujalam suphalam...,"" Bankim Chandra painted the rivers and fields of Bengal as sacred in his words. He turned nature all around him into the Bharat Mata herself.

When first published in Bangadarshan in 1875, the poem had just two lyrical stanzas.

It simply saluted the mother, saying, ""I bow to thee, Mother, rich in waters, waves, forests; seven million voices are your praise."" It was less a war cry than a song of love for the land, written in the famine-stricken 1870s when colonial rule's cruelty was becoming obvious.

""These two stanzas describe in tender language the beauty of the motherland and the abundance of her gifts... The song was never sung as a challenge to any group or community in India and was never considered as such or as offending the sentiments of any community,"" Jawaharlal Nehru later said.

advertisement

Over time, Chatterjee expanded it to six stanzas. He introduced divine imagery, fire, and the sword. The mother became a goddess with a hundred arms and blazing lamps, ready to smite the enemy.

""Thou art Goddess Durga, Lady and Queen, With her hands that strike and her swords of sheen, Thou art Goddess Kamala (Lakshmi), lotus-throned, And Goddess Vani (Saraswati), bestower of wisdom known, pure and perfect without peer, Mother lend thine ear,"" the fifth stanza or the fourth verse said.

The tone shifted to resistance, inspired by the 18th-century Sannyasi Rebellion (1763-1800). It was an uprising of Hindu ascetics against the British and the local Muslim rulers during Bengal's famine years.

HOW VANDE MATARAM BECAME THE ANTHEM OF FREEDOM STRUGGLE

Between 1880 and 1882, Vande Mataram appeared in Bankim Chandra's magazine Bangadarshan before becoming part of Chatterjee's novel Ananda Math (1882). Initially, the poem didn't receive any criticism.

But by the 1905 Swadeshi Movement, it had turned into the heartbeat of defiance. The British banned it in some areas in Bengal. But the people sang it louder. It was first performed as a chorus at the 1886 Congress session by Hem Chandra Bandyopadhyay, and soon, the whole nation knew its rhythm.

advertisement

Later in 1896, it was recited by Rabindranath Tagore at that year's annual Congress Session. The biplabis (revolutionaries of Bengal's freedom movement) saw Vande Mataram as their battle cry against colonial rule.

By the mid 1910s, Vande Mataram had evolved into an unofficial anthem for many freedom fighters in India. Nationalist and sage Sri Aurobindo (born Aurobindo Ghosh) called it ""the mantra of the new religion of patriotism"".

""Rabindranath Tagore sang it while leading nationalist protest processions and Aurobindo Ghosh hailed as the rishi of nationalism. By the 1920s,the song, widely translated into many Indian languages by Subrahmanya Bharati and others, was acquiring the status of a national anthem,"" wrote Sabyasachi Bhattacharya.

By then, numerous societies, publications, and political groups had borrowed the name Vande Mataram, with Congress sessions and public speeches often beginning and ending with it.

However, some frictions surfaced early on over the slogan of Vande Mataram.

""In November 1906, in the Barisal district of East Bengal (now Bangladesh), disturbances broke out when some Hindu processionists shouted Vande Mataram while passing a Muhammadan mosque, despite protests from the Muhammadans engaged in prayer inside,"" wrote Bhattacharya.

However, things started changing from the 1930s onwards.

WHY MUSLIMS OPPOSED VANDE MATARAM DURING FREEDOM STRUGGLE?

The popularity and expansion of the poem made way for controversy too. The goddess imagery alienated Muslims, and the song finding a place in Bankim Chandra's Ananda Math, a novel that spoke of sanyasi revolt against Muslim zamindars, made it sound less national and more sectarian.

In 1923, when Mohammad Ali Jauhar assumed the Congress presidency, he walked out of the meeting as soon as Vande Mataram was sung.

""Through the 1930s and 1940s, the Muslim League persisted in their opposition to the song while the Hindu communal enthusiasm in its favour increased proportionately,"" wrote Bhattacharya.

""The change came about largely because, by the 1940s, the slogan and the song offended many Muslims. It was indeed used as a rallying cry by Hindus in communal riots. In fact, the slogan had been transformed in the intervening years between 1915 and 1947 into a communal war cry,"" added Bhattacharya.

In the political sphere, while Muslims within the Congress began to express mild opposition and even started skipping some meetings and sessions, the fiercest resistance came from the Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, along with certain sections of the press.

In the 1930s and 40s, the Hindu-Muslim fissure widened because of fiercely contested elections, recurring communal riots, and incidents of bloodshed. All of it created a climate of mistrust and fear. In this charged atmosphere, even cultural symbols like the song Vande Mataram became flashpoints.

Jinnah's opposition to Vande Mataram was uncompromising and high-priority. In his negotiation agenda with Jawaharlal Nehru in 1938, he placed it as the second most important issue. The same year, Jinnah said that the Congress had made it ""a hymn to spread hatred for Muslims"".

Gandhi tried to calm the waters, writing in Young India that while he cherished the song, it must not be imposed.

HOW RABINDRANATH TAGORE SEPARATED TWO STANZAS OF VANDE MATARAM

The Congress faced Muslim League pressure, and the issue came to a head.

Subhas Chandra Bose wanted the full song. Nehru, as Congress president, feared alienating Muslims. ""It does seem that this [the novel's] background is likely to irritate the Muslims,"" Nehru wrote to Bose in a 1937 letter.

Nehru then turned to Tagore, who had once sung the song himself at the 1896 Congress session. Tagore advised that only the first two stanzas be used.

Tagore noted that he could easily separate the first two stanzas from the rest of the song. For him, the gentle devotion and the celebration of the land's beauty and blessings in these opening lines held a unique charm, according to Tagore's biographer Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyay.

""I freely concede that the whole of Bankim's Vande Mataram poem, read together with its context, is liable to be interpreted in ways that might wound Moslem's susceptibility, but a national song, though derived from it, which has spontaneously come to consist only of the first two stanzas of the original poem, need not remind us every time of the whole of it, much less of the story with which it was accidentally associated. It has acquired a separate individuality and an inspiring significance of its own in which I see nothing to offend any sect or community,"" Tagore wrote back to Nehru in October 1937.

WHEN CONGRESS ADOPTED VANDE MATARAM AS NATIONAL SONG

Soon, the Congress Working Committee met in Calcutta between October 26 and November 1, with Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, Bose, Azad, and Prasad. The first two stanzas of Vande Mataram were adopted as the National Song of India, and it was decided that it would be sung at national gatherings.

""It is obvious that great songs and anthems cannot be produced to order. They come when genius wills it, and even when they come they have to seek the suffrage of the people. The recognition of a national anthem must wait till such a song has proved its worth by its excellence and popularity and the sentiment that gathers..."" Nehru wrote in the resolution he drafted.

After Independence in 1950, the Constituent Assembly gave that version its place alongside Jana Gana Mana as India's National Song. Today, its two stanzas are sung in schools, at events, and in stadiums, with the AR Rahman version sneaking in. The full version survives in the book, cultural spaces, with its soul intact.

However, almost a century later, Vande Mataram, while it glows as a hymn of unity, it still triggers a very small section. For some people, its full form is a slogan of pride. Others see a divide. Truth lies in between. Its soul isn't in how many stanzas we sing, but in how we mean them.

Highlighting Congress’s repeated electoral failures since 2024, Prime Minister Modi questioned its ability to secure even 100 seats across six states. He further pointed out that Congress had not managed to win a single election in six states since 2024. He argued these results reflected a broader issue within the party and signalled unrest among its members, suggesting Congress’s trajectory was unsustainable for its coalition partners.

""Today, the Congress has become MMC - Muslim League Maoist Congress and the entire agenda of the Congress now revolves around this, and therefore, within the Congress as well, a separate faction is emerging that is uncomfortable with this negative politics. I think that there could be another major split in the Congress,"" he said.

He referenced discontent within Congress, attributing it to the party’s leadership. Modi refrained from naming Rahul Gandhi directly, but indicated that internal disagreements had led to dissatisfaction and weakened the party’s cohesion.

Accusing the Congress of divisive politics, Prime Minister Modi claimed that the party lacked a positive agenda for the country. He expressed concern that it was promoting interests not aligned with national development, distancing itself further from mainstream discourse and even from its own coalition partners.

""Even Congress’s allies are beginning to understand that Congress is drowning everyone in its negative politics. That is why, during the Bihar elections, I said that the ‘naamdaar’ of the Congress is practising to drown himself and others in the Bihar elections by taking a dip in the pond,"" he said.

He described Congress as a “parasite” and warned its alliance partners to be cautious. Modi stated, “I had earlier warned Congress’s allies from this very stage that Congress has become a liability. It is a parasite party that wants to make a comeback by swallowing the vote banks of its allies. That is why even its partners need to be cautious of Congress.”

Modi also predicted that conflicts between Congress and its partners, such as the RJD, would become more visible after their defeat in Bihar. He alleged that Congress had insulted both him and the Election Commission during the campaign, accusing the party of undermining the electoral process.

After the NDA’s win, Modi described the result as a mandate for pro-people and pro-development politics. He asserted that the victory demonstrated public endorsement for the NDA’s governance record and its focus on economic advancement.

Football enthusiast and a player of some skill, Revanth Reddy, demonstrated on Friday, how to score a political goal.

After three successive electoral defeats in the Jubilee Hills assembly constituency - 2014, 2018 and 2023 - the Congress managed to storm the goalpost in the by-election whose result was announced on Friday.

advertisement

In the assembly elections in December 2023, the Congress failed to open its account in the 24 urban seats in the capital city Hyderabad. Now it has made a dent in the BRS citadel by winning two seats in bypolls - Secunderabad Cantonment last year and Jubilee Hills now.

What made the victory doubly sweet, a la Hyderabadi delicacy double ka meetha, was the margin. The late BRS MLA Maganti Gopinath, whose demise caused the bypoll, had won by over 16,000 votes both in 2023 and 2018, but Congress candidate Naveen Yadav's margin this time was over 24,000 votes. Proof that a significant part of the electorate had deserted the BRS car.

Not that the BRS, led by its Working President, KT Rama Rao, did not put up a good fight. It did. KTR's roadshows packed a punch, with several LED screens highlighting the promises made by the Congress in 2023 which it claimed have not been fulfilled so far. While it alleges distribution of money by the Congress as a factor that tilted the scales in favour of the ruling party, it still does not cover up for the strategic mistakes the BRS made in its election campaign.

The first mistake was the choice of candidate. The BRS banked heavily on the sympathy vote for Maganti Sunitha, Gopinath's widow. But its own cadre was unhappy with her candidature and conceded that the sympathy factor was not at play.

The second chink in the BRS election armour was the sheer mismatch in strength. The Congress deployed its entire cabinet, including newly minted minister Mohammed Azharuddin, into the campaign. The chief minister led from the front, almost as if he was on the stump.

Ministers were allocated specific areas and this microplanning has paid the Congress rich dividends. On the other hand, KTR was the lone warrior for the BRS.

Former minister and cousin Harish Rao suffered a bereavement and was missing from the campaign. What also hurt the BRS’s chances was the radio silence from party supremo K Chandrasekhar Rao. By not even making a digital media appeal for his candidate, KCR sent the message that Jubilee Hills voters were not worth his time and that the party's performance did not matter. Missing in action was bad optics.

From the Congress point of view, the win showed that the Telangana unit of the party, for all the talk of being a divided house, can also work like a cohesive team with the captain leading from the front. 2025 for the Congress, was 2023 revisited and that would gladden the party.

advertisement

Mistake number three was to misread the Muslim mind. No sooner did Azhar take the oath as Minority Welfare Minister in the Telangana government that the BRS labelled him a “temporary minister”. Even though Azhar is seen as a celebrity Muslim, the community did not appreciate anyone else lampooning him.

Secondly, the BRS believed that the MIM would not transfer its votes to the Congress candidate. The result showed that the MIM delivered on its word and while the Congress leadership in Delhi is anathema to Asaduddin Owaisi, the Hyderabad MP enjoys a good working relationship with Revanth Reddy.

For the MIM, it was also about the messaging. A BRS win would have led to the conclusion that the MIM has little control over the Muslim voters in Hyderabad and that would have been political suicide.

Mistake number four was the nature of the messaging. The BRS mocked the Congress welfare schemes, as it pitched its track record of having converted Hyderabad into a glitzy investment destination against it.

The problem was that the Congress knew its target audience better. A large part of the Jubilee Hills electorate consists of slums where sops like issuing ration cards and supplying fine rice to over 2 lakh beneficiaries, obviously mattered more. The Congress focused on its positives, banking on a vote of gratitude.

advertisement

Mistake number five was the BRS attack on HYDRAA, the Telangana government's ambitious drive to clear encroachments and reclaim the water bodies, in order to prevent flooding in Hyderabad.

The opposition party believed that voters would give the aggressive demolition of encroachments the thumbs down. Jubilee Hills, through its vote, showed that the people do not want their homes to go underwater every monsoon. The verdict means that HYDRAA would now be emboldened to spread its tentacles further.

While the BRS can officially say that bypolls tend to favour the ruling party, there is no denying the fact that its anti-Revanth Reddy narrative failed to find many takers.

But the BRS is not the only one that is in mourning. The results are bad news for the BJP as well, finishing a poor third. Jubilee Hills is part of the Secunderabad Lok Sabha constituency which is represented by Union Coal minister G Kishen Reddy and therefore, this humiliating defeat will be seen as a reflection on him as well.

The verdict will now work like a tonic for the Congress ahead of the local body elections in rural Telangana and the municipal elections in Hyderabad. Five years ago, the Congress got single digit seats out of 150 wards in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections with the BRS and BJP dominating the show. Expect a realignment of political forces and behind-the-scenes adjustments to prevent the Congress from doing a Lionel Messi to them.

A video of the dramatic encounter went viral on social media, drawing widespread attention.

According to reports, the survivor was initially prevented from meeting the DIG by both male and female officers at the police station. Undeterred, she managed to slip past them and directly approached the senior officer to demand justice.

After she intercepted the vehicle of the senior cop, the officer stepped out of the car and gave her an opportunity to narrate her ordeal.

""Sir, six people brutally raped me sometime back,"" the woman said. ""Have they been put into jai?"" the DIG asked. ""Four of them have been jailed, two are absconding"", she replied.

""I approached the police, but my pleas fell on deaf ears and no concrete action has been taken,"" a video showed the woman as saying to the senior police official. ""Call the CO (circle officer) here"", the DIG said.

The senior cop then instructed concerned officials to help her out and do what is required in the case. ""They often chase my brother to thrash him too,"" the survivor further claimed.

DIG assured that all others accused would be arrested soon and sent to jail, ensuring the woman of justice.

The woman was allegedly gang-raped by six men a few days ago. Police have arrested four of the accused and remanded them to jail, while two remain at large. During her meeting with the DIG, the victim appealed for the immediate arrest of the remaining suspects.

The DIG assured her that efforts were underway to apprehend all absconding accused and that they would be brought to justice soon. Authorities have reportedly intensified the search for the fugitives.

The party could not retain the Budgam seat and also finished third in Nagrota.

The party lost in Budgam, the seat National Conference leader and J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah vacated in the 2024 elections after he also won the Ganderbal seat. Aga Syed Muntazir Mehdi, a candidate from former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti's People's Democratic Party (PDP) won the Budgam seat with 21,576 votes.

advertisement

NC candidate Aga Syed Mahmood Al-Mosvai finished second behind Mehdi with 17,098 votes, trailing the PDP candidate by 4,478 votes.

Sources told India Today that National Conference MP from Srinagar, Aga Ruhulla, stayed away from campaigning due to differences with Omar Abdullah, which may have contributed to the party's poor showing in the Assembly constituency.

Omar Abdullah vacating the seat for Ganderbal in 2024 had necessitated the by-election. With this, the PDP's tally in the J&K Legislative Assembly has now reached 4.

It is also being seen as a moral victory for Mehbooba Mufti's party as the seat was won by a stalwart National Conference leader like Omar Abdullah in the 2024 Assembly elections.

Political pandits are also analysing the NC's loss in Budgam as a verdict by the people of the constituency, keeping in mind the one-year performance of the Omar Abdullah government since returning to power.

The National Conference also finished a distant third in the Nagrota bypoll, with party candidate Shamim Begum settling for 10,872 votes, which was 31,478 votes behind the eventual winner, BJP's Devyani Rana. She had 42,350 votes cast in her favour.

Jammu & Kashmir National Panthers Party (India)'s Hars Dev Singh finished second with 17,703 votes.

The BJP managed to retain the Nagrota Assembly seat in the bypoll which was necessitated by the death of sitting MLA Devender Singh Rana in October 2024.

Political experts suggest theBJP has reinforced its dominance in Jammu Division by retaining the Nagrota seat, as 30-year-old Devyani Rana won a by-election by a commanding margin of over 24,600 votes.

A graduate of the University of California in economics, she steps into the political arena carrying forward the legacy of her late father Devender Singh Rana—a seasoned BJP legislator from Nagrota.

The results dealt a blow to the National Conference, whose candidate finished a distant third, signalling that the BJP’s tally in the J&K Assembly has climbed back to 29 and its stronghold in the region remains intact.

Actions against the H-1B programme bode ill for Indian professionals, who are the biggest beneficiary of the temporary work visa. The H-1B is also used as a pathway to American citizenship, through the Green Card route.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the GOP leader, accused US firms of abusing the programme to undermine the benefits for American workers.

""Big Tech, AI giants, hospitals, and industries across the board have abused the H-1B system to cut out our own people,"" she said in a post on X on Thursday (US time).

""Americans are the most talented people in the world, and I have full faith in the American people. I serve Americans only, and I will ALWAYS put Americans first,"" she added.

She said the bill proposes ending the H-1B programme and prioritising American workers in sectors such as technology, healthcare, engineering, and manufacturing.

""My bill ELIMINATES the corrupt H-1B program and puts AMERICANS FIRST again in tech, healthcare, engineering, manufacturing, and every industry that keeps this country running!! If we want the next generation to have the American Dream, we must stop replacing them and start investing in them,"" she said in the post.

""Greene's bill offers one ""exemption"" for 10,000 visas to be issued per year for medical professionals like doctors and nurses, Greene said. That exemption will be phased out after 10 years, she added.

Greene noted, however, that even the 10,000-per-year cap would be phased out over a decade to provide time to develop a domestic pipeline of American doctors and physicians.

Greene further said that the bill will also ""take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.

The programme is used by US firms, especially in tech, to import talent, more than 70% of whom are Indian.

DONALD TRUMP'S RARE SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR H-1B VISAS

The development follows Trump's statement in which he defended the need for the H-1B program during a Fox News interview, stating in part that the US does not possess adequate domestic talent for certain positions in tech and defence.

During the interview, Trump was asked whether his administration would prioritise the H-1B visa programme over fears that it could suppress wages for American workers.

""I agree, but you do also have to bring in talent,"" he replied.

When the interviewer interjected and said, ""We have plenty of talented workers,"" the President quickly shot back, ""No, you don't.""

advertisement

""You don't have certain talents. People have to learn. You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say, 'I'm going to put you into a factory where we're going to make missiles',"" he added.

The bill, if introduced, will add to ongoing congressional and public debates regarding the future of the H-1B program and broader immigration reform efforts, Newsweek reported.

In his victory speech, the PM hailed the landslide majority as the victory of the developmental politics orchestrated by both Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar and the Central government. He also took a sharp jibe at the Mahagathbandhan over its abysmal performance in Bihar.

TOP QUOTES FROM PM'S SPEECH

Bihar has once again shown that lies lose, people's trust wins. Bihar has made it clear that people will not support those who are out on bail.

When I used to speak about Jungle Raj and Katta Sarkar in the Bihar elections, the RJD party raised no objections. But it hurt the people of Congress. Today, I want to reiterate that Katta Sarkar will never return to Bihar.

Some parties in Bihar had created the appeasement formula of MY. But today's victory has given a new positive MY formula, and that is Mahila and Youth.

Today, the Congress has become the MMC- Muslim League Maoist Congress and the entire agenda of the Congress now revolves around this, and therefore, within the Congress as well, a separate faction is emerging that is uncomfortable with this negative politics.

Ganga flows through Bihar and reaches Bengal. Bihar has also paved the way for the BJP's victory in Bengal. I also congratulate the brothers and sisters of Bengal. Now, together with you, the BJP will uproot jungle raj from West Bengal as well.

Out of the six seats the HAM contested, it seems poised to win five of them in Bihar's southwestern Magadh region. Known to have a strong backing of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, the HAM played a crucial role in consolidating these votes for the NDA, especially in the reserved seats.

advertisement

With the NDA sweeping Bihar, the spotlight is on its heavyweights, like, the BJP, JDU and LJP. But cutting through the noise, Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM has quietly punched above its weight, winning five of six seats.

The HAM's influence is reflected in the NDA's overall tally, which drew support from a wide range of voters. The HAM's impressive strike rate turned out to be the icing on the cake for the alliance, helping it sweep the 243-member assembly with a decisive performance.

The HAM demanded a minimum of 15 seats, while reports suggest the BJP was not ready to accept Manjhi's demand. Given HAM's vote base and targeted influence, the BJP could not afford to go to the polls without the HAM. Finally, the HAM was allotted six seats, all of them reserved for the Scheduled Castes. The Ham, as of 6.45 PM, is leading in four seats and has won one.

The HAM's value lies not just in its modest seat tally but in its impressive strike rate, the efficiency with which it converted seats into wins.

This metric underscores the HAM's role in consolidating the SC vote, a crucial segment of Bihar's population. It helped the NDA broaden its social base beyond the so-called upper castes, the EBCs and the non-Yadav OBCs.

Additionally, HAM's track record, combined with its influence in caste politics, makes the small party, formed in 2015 after Manjhi parted ways with the JD(U), a key ally in the alliance.

To understand HAM's significance more, we have to consider its electoral track record.

In the 2015 Bihar assembly elections, HAM contested 21 seats and secured just one victory. Manjhi won at Imamganj. It was a tough debut, with the Mahagathbandhan (JDU-RJD-Congress combine) sweeping 178 seats.

The turning point came in 2017 when Nitish Kumar realigned with the BJP, pulling the NDA back to power in Bihar.

HAM HELPED NDA CROSS MAJORITY MARK IN 2020 ASSEMBLY POLLS

HAM joined the fold, aligning its politics with the NDA's broader outreach. This paid dividends in the 2020 Assembly polls, where HAM contested seven seats and won four. It was a strike rate of nearly 57%.

advertisement

These victories, including Manjhi's from the party's stronghold Imamganj, provided the NDA with a razor-thin majority of 125 seats in the 243-member house. Without the HAM's haul, the coalition might have fallen short, especially as the JD(U) and BJP secured 43 and 74 seats respectively.

The HAM's wins helped Nitish Kumar from the government, with Manjhi's son Santosh Kumar Suman joining the Cabinet as a minister. It was a nod to the party stabilising its influence.

HAM'S LOK SABHA STRIKE RATE AND MANJHI'S CABINET BERTH

This strike-rate prowess continued into the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. In the 2024 elections, Manjhi contested from Gaya under the NDA banner and won decisively, vacating his assembly seat for a by-poll victory by his daughter-in-law, Deepa Manjhi.

Appointed Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Manjhi's elevation highlighted the BJP's trust in HAM as a formidable leader of the oppressed. It also helped counter the Opposition attacks on social justice.

Cut to 2025, and seat-sharing talks revealed the HAM's leverage. Manjhi demanded at least 15 seats. However, the BJP pursued its ally, and Manjhi was given six seats to contest in the high-stakes polls.

Though the Union Minister did not shy away from expressing his dissatisfaction with the seat-sharing formula repeatedly, saying that it had ""weakened"" the morale of party workers, he reiterated his commitment to help the NDA retain power in the state.

advertisement

However, the BJP never reacted to Manjhi's dissatisfaction. For the NDA, ignoring the HAM risked ceding SC support.

The HAM again proved its mettle as the party emerged victorious in five of the six seats it contested in the 243-member Assembly.

In short, the NDA sees the HAM as a partner whose efficiency and winnability provide the bloc with a strategic strike value. Rather than contesting large numbers, HAM helped complement the larger partners by anchoring sections of the electorate otherwise harder to mobilise.

There would be no mid-point for his party. As the results of the Bihar Assembly election pour in, revealing that the Jan Suraaj even failed to open its account, the politician Prashant Kishor shouldn't make a hasty retreat as he promised to. Farsh (floor) is the best place for PK and his Jan Suraaj to be on right now.

advertisement

The fable of Icarus reveals what happens when one tries to fly too close to the Sun. The sky, dominated by hawks, is no place for a fledgling party. The floor is where Jan Suraaj should be. Stay grounded, stay connected, and stay invested.

Decades ago, Kanshi Ram, one of India's political icons and founder of the Bahujan Samaj Party, gave a masterplan for aspirants like PK. The first election is to lose, the second to cause defeats, and the third to emerge victorious, Ram suggested.

For three years, Prashant Kishor has been on the road in Bihar. He launched a 3,000-km Jan Suraaj padayatra, on October 2, 2022 from Champaran, where his idol MK Gandhi kicked off the Satyagrah in 1917.

This isn't the time to withdraw, but to build on what has been achieved. Everyone in Bihar now knows of Prashant Kishor and his Jan Suraaj—and that's no mean achievement. For decades, Bihar has been the battlefield of veterans, largely witnessing a two-cornered fight.

One might use the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) example to try and prove Kanshi Ram wrong and suggest that a debutant can score big, but Delhi—small and mostly urban—is hardly an example of the electoral maze called India.

Analysts have noted that Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj, which secured third or fourth positions in dozens of Bihar Assembly seats, might have eaten into the RJD's votes.

Both RJD and Jan Suraaj campaigned on similar themes, such as unemployment, migration, brain drain from the state, and replacing Nitish Kumar, who has been the CM for over two decades.

Voting in Bihar has calcified along caste lines. It is there that Prashant Kishor, with issues of employment, migration and the subjugation of Biharis, managed to make a mark in the minds of voters.

""If the JD(U) gets above 25 seats in the upcoming Assembly Elections, I will leave politics. Even if JD(U) wins more than 25 seats and a Jan Suraj government is formed, I still won't back down,"" Prashant Kishor told media outlets in October.

Though PK is the butt of jokes and memes today, no one can hold the politician Prashant Kishor hostage to his words. He should neither retreat nor blame the people's mandate.

advertisement

""Abraham Lincoln famously said elections belong to the people and it's their decision. They decided to turn their back on the fire; if they get burned, they will just have to sit with the blisters,"" Jan Suraaj spokesperson Anukriti told India Today TV.

Whatever said, today's the day for PK to lick his wounds. Take the jibes his way. Being with politicians through the years, he is all too familiar with what comes after election losses.

After he has drowned his sorrows in dry Bihar, what PK should instead focus on is what he has gained. He dared to bet his years of respect, money and career on a schoolbag, in a state that still votes for the lantern. He brought a new narrative to the state and spoke to the youth of hope in Bihar. The crowd behind PK was organic, not the usual paid audience we often see in political rallies. Like AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal retreated to Chandigarh after the Delhi debacle, PK must stay in Bihar.

Jan Suraaj is now counted among 'Others' in the voting tally. The four in 'Others' have 13.5% of the vote share, which translates to 35 lakh votes. Only the final tally will confirm the votes won by Jan Suraaj. But it is safe to say lakhs stood in queues and trusted Prashant Kishor's party with their precious votes. Prashant Kishor has lakhs of those hopes to build on. He might find himself farsh par, but that's a fantastic beginning.

Laced with sarcasm, the post turned out to be a prophecy for the high-voltage elections in India's one of the most politically crucial states.

The 88-year-old Sinha, whose barbs at the ruling dispensation often draw eyeballs, accidentally outdid even psephologists and political analysts by foretelling Bihar's electoral fate, that too, with precision.

He tweeted from his X handle on November 11: ""The exit polls of Bihar assembly polls are all wrong. My survey shows that NDA is winning at least 200 seats and Mahagathbandhan is being wiped out. I am not responsible if my prediction proves woefully wrong on the 14th of November.""

The sarcasm turned out to be an oracle on November 14. The NDA actually won over 200 seats in a 243-member House, and it was a complete washout for the Mahagathbandhan, which was down by over 80 seats compared to the previous Assembly polls in Bihar.

Yashwant Sinha, who served as the Minister of External Affairs from July 2002 to May 2004 in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, parted ways with the BJP in April 2018. He became a critic of the Modi government and the BJP, and contested the Presidential election as the opposition candidate in 2022.

Yashwant Sinha's sarcastic post came after exit polls predicted a return of the NDA in Bihar. Shared on November 11, nine exit polls projected that the NDA was set to win more than 147 seats. The Mahagathbandhan, the pollsters said, was likely to secure around 90 seats.

Sinha's tweet went viral by the afternoon on Friday, with reactions pouring in on the sarcastic prediction.

Founder of ad and marketing agency, Abhishek Asthana, who goes by the name Gabbar with over 1.5 million followers on X, said, ""Congrats sir for the accurate prediction.""

Another user, Gelson Luz, said from his verified account, ""These predictions are like my Aunt Mabel's famous chilli: always a bit too optimistic on the heat. History shows us that political fortunes can turn quicker than a startled cat. It's best to just wait for the official tally, don't you think?""

The tweet is now viral with nearly a million views.

Sinha, who is from Patna, was a bureaucrat for over two decades before he plunged into politics with the Janata Party in 1984.

A seasoned parliamentarian, he served multiple terms in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. He also had two stints as Finance Minister under Chandra Shekhar in 1990-91 and later under Atal Bihari Vajpayee from 1998-2002.

He was also the External Affairs Minister from 2002 to 2004, exiting the BJP in 2018. After his failed bid for the President's post in 2022 as an Opposition candidate, Sinha has largely stayed out of public focus. But his sarcastic post, which boomeranged during the Bihar Assembly polls, has once again brought him back into the spotlight.

The Ajay Devgn-Rakul Preet Singh starrer brings back the familiar 'fight in love and fight for love' trope, but adds a new layer to its age-defying romance -- this time with a louder, more colourful commercial pulse.

advertisement

The story is simple, almost comfortably so. The film opens with a quick recap of how Ashish (Devgn) and Aisha (Rakul) fell in love despite their significant age gap, and how they fought to make their relationship work. 'De De Pyaar De 2' picks up from there, shifting the battleground to Aisha's family home -- an expansive, modern household that prides itself on being ""open-minded and progressive,"" yet struggles to digest that their future son-in-law is just a few years younger than the family patriarch.

Aisha and Ashish now have a new challenge: seeking approval from her progressive-but-not-really parents. ""Acceptance is a process,"" Aisha declares in a monologue. But if Bollywood romances have taught us anything, it's that nothing ever goes as planned for the lovers on screen.

Director Anshul Sharma keeps the tone breezy, funny, quirky, dramatic, and vibrant. The film retains the glossy charm of the first instalment, and that's where a lot of its appeal lies. But its biggest hiccup is also its most unavoidable one: the awkward casting.

Jaaved Jaaferi and Meezan Jafri bring energy and humour, but R Madhavan, despite his undeniable acting chops, feels oddly misplaced. Maybe it's because we're simply not ready to see Maddy playing the father of a 20-something girl. His scenes with Rakul, especially the one where he lifts and twirls her in a song meant to evoke emotional resonance, lean more awkward than teary.

As for Ajay and Rakul, the chemistry still isn't crackling, but it works well enough to sell the story. There are no intimate moments here, but both play their parts with conviction -- he as the intense, brooding partner, and she as the bubbly, determined young woman refusing to let her father map out her life.

Meezan, meanwhile, is the delightful surprise package. Stylish, confident, and a natural on the dance floor, he lights up the screen, especially in the film's most enjoyable song sequence with his father. There's still room for him to grow as an actor, but he's undeniably charismatic.

Rakul is charming and effortless in lighter moments, but falters during the emotionally heavy scenes. Her big breakdown in front of her mother (Gautami Kapoor) unintentionally echoes reality-TV dramatics -- think Tanya Mittal from 'Bigg Boss 19' -- who might've actually pulled it off better.

advertisement

Ishita Dutta and Gautami add warmth and grounding to the narrative.

Despite its bumps, 'De De Pyaar De 2' remains consistently entertaining. You'll laugh, roll your eyes, and might even find yourself unexpectedly invested in the last-act twist. It doesn't reinvent the rom-com wheel, but it keeps it spinning with enough charm.

It's perfectly crowd-pleasing, and comfortably familiar -- never extraordinary, but never dull either. It's the kind of movie you watch knowing exactly what you'll get, and you get precisely that. 'De De Pyaar De 2' is comfortable. Watch it if you like rom-coms, and want to give Bollywood a chance.

That's because the NDA looked headed for a landslide victory, and Chirag Paswan's LJP(RV) playing his part in style. Such was Chirag's performance, some even jumped the gun to declare that he had outshone his father, the late Ram Vilas Paswan. Just like Ravindra Jadeja, who decimates the opposition with his fiery strike rate, Chirag Paswan has dazzled as the finisher in the NDA camp.

advertisement

Chirag's LJP (RV) was given 29 seats with the bigger partners, the BJP and the JD(U) contesting 101 seats each. With the opening line-up doing their job like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli would have, it was for Chirag's party to see that the victory was sealed. And Chirag did that in style.

After scoring a perfect 5/5 in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, PM Narendra Modi's self-proclaimed ""Hanuman"" is now scripting a big moment. The LJP(RV) is leading in 23 of 29 seats it contested. It is not a 100% strike rate like in the Lok Sabha polls, but a big haul that has stunned many. As of 12.45 PM, the LJP (RV), with more than 5% vote share, is leading in several seats in Magadh, Seemanchal and Patliputra regions.

And the story is that the LJP(RV)'s surge has been powered by voters of the BJP, the JD(U) and the smaller allies. It is the consolidation the NDA must have expected. Chirag's party has returned the favour, too, in terms of vote transfer.

At the micro level, this is the LJP(RV)'s most explosive showing yet. It's a stunning jump from the 2020 Bihar Assembly election, when it went solo and won just a single seat. In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, the LJP(RV) fielded candidates in 137 seats and Chirag Paswan's fierce, anti-Nitish campaign ended up slicing into the JD(U)'s votes, dragging Nitish Kumar's tally down from 71 seats in 2015 to just 43. Much of this setback was widely seen as the result of LJP(RV)'s vote-cutting impact.

Now, with the LJP(RV) contesting firmly within the NDA in 2025, the Chirag Paswan–led party not only delivered a strong result of its own but, thanks to a smooth vote transfer, also helped lift the Nitish-led JD(U)'s tally and boosted the NDA's overall count.

In a way, Chirag truly became the ""Hanuman"" he once claimed to be.

With this Bihar win, Chirag's stock in the NDA is only going to climb. And it's bound to reshape the coalition's internal equations in Bihar, especially given the long-running friction between the LJP(RV) and the JDU.

Now, it is time for Chirag Paswan to celebrate just like Ravindra Jadeja does—raise the bat and sword-swish.

During a Fox News interview, Trump defended the presence of Chinese students at American universities, saying he believed it was “good to have outside countries.”

Host Laura Ingraham pushed back, claiming Chinese nationals “spy on us” and “steal our intellectual property.” In response, Trump asked her, “Do you think the French are better?”

""Yeah,” Ingraham said as Trump disagreed, saying: ""I'm not so sure. We've had a lot of problems with the French.""

This particular snippet from Trump’s interview went viral after journalist Kaitlan Collins shared the clip on X. But it was the French Embassy that delivered the sharpest comeback, using the now-famous “detective” image to mock Trump’s remarks.

“Come on, we've got WAY BETTER spies than China,” it said. The post featured a picture of the “detective” – a sharply dressed man who made headlines during the coverage of the crown jewels theft at the Louvre.

The man - seen in a three-piece suit, gold waistcoat and fedora, holding an umbrella like a cane – had sparked speculation online, with many joking that he was the lead investigator or even a disguised suspect.

However, according to Associated Press photographer Thibault Camus, who took the picture, the man was merely a passerby.

“He appeared in front of me, I saw him, I took the photo,” Camus told AP, adding that the sharply dressed stranger “had nothing to do with the investigation” and left shortly after walking into the frame.

The photograph was taken soon after thieves raided Paris's Louvre museum in broad daylight last month, taking just seven minutes to grab some of France's priceless crown jewels.

Your grandmother might fondly tell you how she used to buy gold jewellery with the money she saved from the monthly ration budget. ""The prices weren't so high back then,"" she'd remind you with a smile.

For our parents' generation, the idea of investment widened a little. Fixed deposits, stocks, and mutual funds entered the picture, and we've all heard those stories of how they bought shares in one company 15 years ago that are now worth a fortune.

advertisement

But for the younger generation, the canvas is expanding even further. With global brands entering India and luxury becoming more accessible, a new question is emerging: can luxury itself be the next big investment for the Indian middle class?

The big shift

""Luxury items can be a good investment,"" says Garvit Goyal, a NISM-certified finance content creator. He feels that this shift is primarily happening because the current generation is blending lifestyle with finance.

""We want our money to reflect our personality, not just sit in a fixed deposit. For older generations, investing was about security, but now it is about self-expression,"" Goyal tells India Today.

So, owning a Rolex or a pair of limited-edition Jordans isn't just a flex, it's culture, status, and also profit.

In India, the idea of luxury as an investment is gaining quiet momentum, adds CA Anamika Rana, a finance content creator.

""For India's middle class, this trend is still emerging but not unrealistic. With better access to resale platforms, owning one or two quality luxury items can now be part of a diversified investment approach, but with caution. These items are illiquid, depend heavily on brand demand, condition, and authenticity, and don't generate regular income like mutual funds or FDs. So they should form a small, passion-driven portion of your portfolio, not the core.""

Meanwhile, Abhishek Kumar, a SEBI-registered adviser and founder of SahajMoney, feels that luxury items are becoming alternative investments as there is a rising class of people in India who have high disposable income and who view luxury goods as alternative stores of value. With more money to spend and a taste for new experiences, the younger generation is redefining what investment means | Photo: Pexels/Andrea Piacquadio

Is it realistic, though?

Kumar tells us that the rising middle class in India, earning less than Rs 20 lakh per annum, is becoming a major buyer of luxury purchases, but most are financing these purchases through EMIs and credit card schemes rather than cash payments.

advertisement

""Many buyers are stretching their finances to appear wealthy rather than genuinely investing, driven by social media and marketing exploitation of insecurities. One needs to distinguish between consumption and investment, as most of these purchases depreciate rather than appreciate with time.""

Further, according to Goyal, investing in luxury is possible but only if you play it smart.

""For the middle class, it doesn't have to be a Rolex or a Hermes bag. It can simply mean limited-edition sneakers or watches in the category one can afford.""

It is crucial to understand that luxury markets work on scarcity and hype. So, you have to stay updated on which brands have resale demand and how to verify authenticity.

Understanding luxury

Not all luxury items grow in value in a similar way.

Timeless pieces with classic designs usually appreciate because their appeal never fades, and their scarcity is real.

Trendy items lose value quickly once the hype dies down.

Limited-edition collectables, however, can see substantial appreciation if held over the long term; their rarity and story often make them truly special.

So, when it comes to luxury investments, it's not just about economics, it's about emotion, heritage, and exclusivity. That's why not all luxury goods behave the same financially.

advertisement

Think of Rolex, Hermes Birkin, Cartier, and Patek Philippe, brands built on legacy, craftsmanship, and limited supply. While they are expensive, they are also steady and reliable in the long run.

On the other hand, trend-driven pieces like Balenciaga sneakers, Gucci belts, and Prada bucket hats often skyrocket in popularity but lose their charm and value just as fast.

So, which is the most popular category?

""Oh, this has to be luxury watches,"" shares Goyal, adding that Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Audemars Piguet are signature status brands.

Watches appreciate because they are produced in limited quantities and are always in demand across the world. A Rolex Daytona, which retailed for around Rs 10 lakh a few years ago, now resells for Rs 25–30 lakh or more, depending on condition and rarity.

Let's not miss the handbag craze

While this market is still at an early stage, it can grow significantly in the near future as aspiration now meets investment.

""Globally, handbags, especially Hermes, Chanel, and Louis Vuitton, have proven to outperform traditional assets at times,"" Goyal tells us.

For example, the Hermes Birkin Index showed an average annual return of 14 per cent, better than gold or the US Index over certain decades.

advertisement

Handbags have a timeless appeal as they never go out of fashion. Plus, women, as per Goyal, are increasingly viewing luxury as part of financial empowerment. But it's still a niche market, so returns and buyers can vary depending on brand and style.

""Personally, I invest in rare luxury handbags,"" shares Rana, adding that it is more from a want perspective than a need perspective.

""I only buy them after securing my basics — emergency fund, mutual funds, insurance, and other traditional investments. That's the golden rule."" Luxury handbags are becoming symbols of financial empowerment for women | Photo: Pexels/Godisable Jacob

Can the middle class participate?

The middle class can invest in luxury but not like the rich do. Goyal says, ""You cannot buy a Rs 25 lakh Rolex just for investment. A lot more goes behind it. Hence, start small. Start with entry-level designer watches, bags, and sneakers that you can afford.""

advertisement Research like an investor, not as a shopper of luxury pieces.

Track resale prices, learn which models hold value, and verify authenticity through official resale platforms.

Also, remember that these are not as liquid as stocks. They should be part of your high-risk portfolio, where you allocate a maximum of 10–15 per cent.

Goyal warns that luxury investing won't make you rich overnight. Some assets might appreciate 10–20 per cent yearly; others might stagnate or drop. So, view it as diversification, not a guaranteed money machine.

Adding to this, Kumar suggests:

Invest only in timeless pieces from heritage brands with a proven resale value and avoid trendy items that lose relevance quickly.

Maintain items in pristine condition through proper storage and care as condition has a major impact on resale value.

Be prepared for a long-term commitment of 10–15 years to see meaningful appreciation.

Avoid EMIs unless you can comfortably repay them without strain.

But where will the money come from?

Banks won't hand out loans for Birkins and Rolexes, but you can play smart. Use low-interest plans to buy a limited-edition, resale-worthy item, suggests Goyal. If the interest cost is less than the expected appreciation, it's worth playing the game.

Or, the best way is to save up enough over months or years so that you can afford to buy it.

""Only allocate 5–10 per cent of your surplus income to such passion-based investments. Enjoy them, hold them long-term, and never compromise your financial security for a label,"" Rana further shares.

The way ahead

In a viral video, actor Ameesha Patel is heard saying that in Japan, a Hermes Birkin bag can be used as collateral for a bank loan. It surely makes one wonder if something like this can work in India in the coming years.

""I believe yes, but not immediately and not widely,"" says Goyal. ""For a bank to accept a Birkin or similar bag as collateral, there needs to be a widely recognised valuation method, clear authenticity, and proper rules and regulations. Without that, the risk is too high for lenders.""

Also, although luxury resale is growing, the standardisation of such valuations and market liquidity are still underdeveloped. ""It might be a possibility in the future, but not for at least the next 5 to 10 years.""

On the outside, it seems like OnePlus is playing it safe this year with a cleaner design, a bigger battery, and a familiar software experience. But dig a little deeper and you will notice some features that quietly change the way the phone behaves. Some decisions make complete sense, others feel surprisingly restrained, and a few are just bold enough to make you wonder what OnePlus is really aiming for. So, is the OnePlus 15 the best flagship buy in 2025? Well, that totally depends on your perspective and needs. But, we have summarised our detailed OnePlus 15 review in 9 points to help make your buying decision easier.

advertisement

OnePlus has hiked the price of the OnePlus 15 by Rs 3,000, when we compare it with the OnePlus 13. But, the initial launch offers let you buy the device at the price of its predecessor. You will be able to buy it at Rs 79,999 via Amazon and other official channels. Now that the price part is out of our way, let's talk about the OnePlus 15's design, gaming performance, display, camera experience and more in 9 points.

OnePlus 15 review in 9 points

1. A cleaner, more grounded design approach this year

OnePlus drops its signature circular camera module in favour of a neat square island for a modern look. The phone has flat frames, a classy matte finish, and a violet tone that looks premium without shouting for attention. It is slimmer at 8.1mm despite packing a massive battery, which speaks to the internal design effort. However, removing the Alert Slider, one of the brand’s most loved hardware features, feels like a step backwards, and the Plus Key doesn’t offer the same instinctive convenience. It is useful but OnePlus fans would likely take sometime to get used to it.

2. Slimmer body, bigger battery

The 7,300mAh battery is the biggest strength of the OnePlus 15. Fitting this cell into a slimmer frame than last year’s model is genuinely impressive. In the hand, the device feels far lighter than its battery capacity suggests, thanks to solid weight distribution. Also, OnePlus has managed to offer the device almost at the weight of the OnePlus 13. The downside is that the slimmer frame, paired with the powerful chipset, means the phone does get warm when pushed hard, something which I noted clearly in the stress tests.

3. Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, excellent numbers on paper

Speaking of which, benchmark results are strong and place the OnePlus 15 strongly in the flagship territory. In our testing, Geekbench multi-core scores touched 9,629, and AnTuTu offered 3.6 million score. These figures confirm the phone can handle everything from heavy apps to high-end gaming. It is a powerhouse because no flagship has scored such a high score on Antutu. The chipset isn’t the absolute thermal champion, but for general usage, it’s more than enough. The peak performance is there, but it’s the sustained performance where some limitations show up.

4. Gaming performance is smooth, but thermals can flare up

advertisement

OxygenOS 16 feels clean, fast, and responsive, the kind of software experience OnePlus has always been appreciated for. App switching is instant, animations look fluid, and gaming is consistently stable. But under repeated heavy tasks, the phone crosses 50°C and loses around 10 percent charge in a 10-minute AnTuTu loop. This isn’t a daily use scenario, but it still shows that the thermal envelope isn’t perfect. In everyday use, the phone behaves brilliantly and it is only during stress bursts that the stability dips.

During my usage, Genshin Impact ran on ""High"" graphics with 30fps by default and I got a smooth experience without over-taxing the hardware. However, switching to higher (60fps) frame rate required me to lower the graphics setting. The same stands for BGMI too, but you get a top-notch gaming performance when you enable High Performance mode in the Settings. Benchmark tests like 3DMark Wild Life Extreme showed 82 per cent stability, indicating that the GPU doesn’t throttle aggressively under sustained load. On the downside, during very long and demanding sessions of about 1.5 to 2 hours, the phone does warm up, which eventually impact frame rate stability.

advertisement

5. 1.5K AMOLED display is sharp, bright, and fluid but not the best

The 6.7-inch AMOLED display offers excellent brightness and a super-smooth 165Hz refresh rate. Although, in our test, the device's panel never reached 165Hz and it mostly stayed on 120Hz or 30Hz. But, I have to say colours are well-tuned, viewing angles are strong, and HDR content looks great. That said, OnePlus moving from QHD+ resolution screen to a 1.5K panel will disappoint users who expect the absolute best display at this price. similarly, the local brightness has been improved, but the peak brightness for HDR video streaming has also dropped by 900nits. Even though the difference isn’t as noticeable in real-world use, on paper, this feels like a compromise to achieve better battery life and efficiency.

6. Battery life is genuinely industry-leading

The OnePlus 15’s endurance is one of the best I have tested this year. Over 15 hours of continuous use in Balanced mode is exceptional, and many users will comfortably get 1.5 days depending on usage. But, keep in mind that some short binge watching sessions and a few hours of gaming drops the battery levels much faster on High Performance mode. So, you could be required to charge after almost 10 hours. The 120W fast charger tops the phone up in around 25 minutes, which reduces charging anxiety drastically. This is the area where OnePlus clearly focused its energy and it pays off. No complaint here.

7. Cameras deliver reliable results, but don’t push boundaries

The main camera produces crisp, balanced shots with realistic skin tones, plenty of details and pleasing colours in daylight. Low-light performance is decent but not on the level of big camera-centric brands. The telephoto performance is where it feels like the phone could have done better because zoom photos lack the clarity and details expected in this price bracket. The camera system is reliable for everyday use, but it isn’t the standout upgrade some were hoping for. It is good, but not exceptional.

8. Software is clean, but the UI experience could feel repetitive

OxygenOS 16 retains its clean look, which many users like. Navigation is smooth, and there isn’t a lot of bloatware. But the UI now feels more iOS-like than uniquely OnePlus-like. Users who have been following the brand for years may feel the identity fading slightly. The Plus Key also doesn’t feel as natural as the Alert Slider it replaces. Still, overall stability and polish remain strengths.

9. A mature flagship that focuses on dependability, not disruption

The OnePlus 15 doesn’t chase breakthroughs or experimental features. It settles comfortably into a rhythm of offering strong performance, excellent battery life, a clean design, rapid charging, and everyday reliability. Its weaknesses? noticeable thermals under extreme stress, decent telephoto performance, the 1.5K display choice, and the removal of the Alert Slider keep it from feeling truly bold. But it’s clear that OnePlus played it safe by prioritising balance and stability over risks.

For many users, this will be exactly what they want. For enthusiasts expecting a big leap, it may feel a bit too safe. Overall, the OnePlus 15 feels like a well-rounded flagship phone and power users will likely love it.

Current counting trends show the party struggling to make any impact, remaining without a seat, while the NDA takes a massive lead.

Positioned as a revolutionary third alternative to the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the opposition Mahagathbandhan, the JSP initially led in two constituencies before sliding back to zero, closely aligning with the near-unanimous predictions of major exit polls.

Despite fielding candidates in almost all assembly seats and running a year-long, intensive grassroots campaign, including the popular Jan Suraaj Padyatra, the party has been unable to convert its momentum into substantial electoral gains. In its debut electoral fight, the JSP contested 238 seats and, so far, has managed to secure third place in several constituencies.

Most exit polls had forecasted a near-total rout for the party. Axis My India projected around 4 per cent of the vote share but no seats, while Matrize estimated 0–2 seats and Dainik Bhaskar predicted 0-3. Other agencies, including Chanakya Strategies, P-Marq, JVC, People’s Insight, and People’s Pulse, similarly did not expect JSP to cross the single-digit mark.

However, analysts note that JSP could emerge as a decisive factor in closely contested seats, potentially diverting significant anti-incumbency votes, particularly among young voters.

Many observers also credit the party with influencing the political discourse. Prashant Kishor’s relentless focus on core issues, unemployment, migration, education, and healthcare, helped shape much of the poll narrative, compelling major alliances to address these concerns more directly in their campaigns.

Not an intentional manoeuvre, this return showcases the chaotic dance of celestial mechanics influenced by Earth, the Moon, and gravitational forces at play.

In early September 2025, asteroid tracking data revealed that Chandrayaan-3’s service module would encounter the Moon twice in early November. This was confirmed when the PM entered the Moon's Sphere of Influence (SOI) on November 4, as confirmed by Isro.

WATCH CHANDRAYAAN-3 PULLED BY THE MOON

CHANDRAYAAN-3 was last reported by https://t.co/jPw7NGPQYB on 2025-06-27. In September it became obvious from asteroid tracking data that the service module would encounter the Moon in early November twice. pic.twitter.com/A3sV3sBU3B — Scott Tilley (@coastal8049) November 14, 2025

The first lunar flyby occurred on November 6 at a distance of 3,740 kilometers from the lunar surface, followed by a second close encounter on November 11 at 4,537 kilometers away.

This unexpected lunar rendezvous is a consequence of the natural three-body problem dynamics, the gravitational interplay between Earth, the Moon, and the spacecraft, which caused Chandrayaan-3’s PM orbit to drift and be captured briefly by the Moon’s gravity.

Isro engineers continue monitoring the spacecraft’s trajectory carefully as it navigates this complex gravitational environment.

CHANDRAYAAN-3 WILL RETURN TO THE MOON AGAIN

Amateur astronomer Scott Tilley, known for tracking space debris and satellites, analysed the PM’s future and suggested the possibility of another lunar encounter around April 2026.

Beyond that, the spacecraft’s orbit may become unstable, potentially sending it into a solar orbit or leading to impact scenarios with either the Moon or Earth, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of objects in deep space around multiple gravitational bodies.

The Chandrayaan-3 PM originally carried the Lander and Rover to the Moon, supporting a historic soft landing and lunar surface exploration in August 2023. Following mission completion, the PM was repositioned into a high-altitude Earth orbit to test extended operations and collect valuable scientific data.

This ongoing story of Chandrayaan-3’s service module highlights the intricacies of orbital mechanics in multi-body systems and underscores the challenges of long-term space operations.

It also provides invaluable insights for future lunar and interplanetary missions in managing spacecraft trajectories in chaotic gravitational environments.

Maj Gen Katoch said the conspiracy carried the hallmarks of a “classic regime change operation,” strategically planned between December and January, coinciding with the scheduled visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to India. According to him, multiple blasts were planned until 26 January. “This was not a standalone act of terror but a coordinated plan with geopolitical motives,” he said.

He identified Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) as the central organisation behind the plot, asserting that the operational trail from propaganda posters in Kashmir to the procurement of explosives linked directly to Pakistan’s military establishment and government. “The signature is clearly that of Jaish,” he said.

The retired Major General said the network consisted of sleeper cells embedded across India for years, including individuals radicalised locally and sent abroad for training. He described the arrests as the outcome of “one of India’s most successful counter-intelligence operations,” adding that the scale of devastation planned was “massive.”

According to him, the motive behind the plot was revenge for Operation Sindoor, which significantly weakened terror networks in the region. He suggested that Pakistan’s proximity to the US may have emboldened such attempts. “They wanted to avenge their losses,” he said.

Calling the conspiracy “an act of war,” Major Gen Katoch said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that the perpetrators will not be spared. “The response will be of India’s choosing in time, scale, and manner. Operation Sindoor continues,” he concluded.

The explosion began when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi answered a seemingly routine question in parliament last Friday. Asked what Chinese actions against Taiwan could trigger Japan's right to collective self-defence, her response was unequivocal: battleships, force, or any military operation around Taiwan could constitute a survival-threatening situation for Japan under its 2015 security law, potentially allowing Japanese troops to enter the conflict.

advertisement

Beijing's reaction was immediate and furious. China's foreign ministry branded her comments ""egregious"" and ""gross interference"". But the crisis escalated dramatically when Xue Jian, China's consul general in Osaka, reshared news of her remarks with a chilling threat: ""the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off"". Though Xue deleted the post, the damage was done.

Japan filed strong protests. China demanded Takaichi retract her statement. She refused, insisting her words reflected Japan's traditional position. China responded by warning that Japan was ""playing with fire"" and issued an open threat: if Japan ""dares to meddle"" in the Taiwan situation, it would be considered an ""act of aggression"".

On Thursday, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong summoned Japan's ambassador, calling Takaichi's comments ""extremely wrong and dangerous"". His warning was stark: all consequences would be borne by Japan. Chinese state media threatened Japan would ""suffer a crushing defeat"" if it intervened militarily.

Japan has held its ground, reaffirming its One-China principle whilst refusing to disavow Takaichi's remarks. This subtle but significant shift acknowledges Taiwan's direct link to Japan's security, a position Beijing considers unacceptable.

With military tensions already high, Chinese jets entering Taiwan's air defence zone almost daily, and both sides digging in deeper, the question is no longer whether this crisis will escalate, but how far either side is willing to go before diplomatic warnings become something far more dangerous.

Netflix’s ‘In Your Dreams’ presents a conventional animated story that gives you warmth, comfort, and feel-good moments without eating up a lot of your time, patience, or tissues. “Same, same but different” was the feeling while watching this template animated film, which is about a twelve-year-old girl’s efforts to fix her family’s problems by literally trying to make her dream come true.

advertisement

Stevie is a simple girl with a happy life—loving parents, cute dreams, and an annoying younger brother, Elliot. Over the years, the happy family moments become scarce, the brother grows older and more annoying, the parents distance themselves from each other, and Stevie’s happy family isn’t happy anymore. While the family is on the verge of splitting up, Stevie and Elliot come across a mysterious book about the Sandman.

Through this book, they gain access to live their dreams, with the catch that if they find the Sandman, who holds the power to make their dream come true, they could save their family from falling apart. What follows is the adventure of a nighttime, where breakfast cereals and lost toys come to life, beds turn into horses, nightmares turn into curses, and Stevie and Elliot are in a race against time to keep the family united.

‘In Your Dreams’, directed by Alex Woo and Erik Benson, presents a simple animated film about the love children have for their parents and the extent they can go to in order to keep their family together and live happily like before. The story, written by Stanley Moore along with the directors, is about a family coming together to save each other from getting lost in their own worlds—some in their dreams and some in reality.

“Short and sweet” is the best way to sum up this film. It may not leave a lasting impact, but it is a breezy watch that brings a few smiles, gives you the feels, makes you love Elliot, and then parts ways—nothing more, nothing less. The film touches on sensitive themes like a child’s emotional state in a breaking family, the mental pressure that comes with it, and how retreating into delusion can feel safer than facing reality. Yet, the presentation is sugar-coated enough to keep anything from feeling triggering, making it an easy and enjoyable 90-minute watch (75–80 minutes without the credit roll).

And the problem? The film looks good, but it never shakes off the feeling that you’ve seen all of this before. The animation style, the world-building, the emotional beats—they echo Pixar and Universal so closely that ‘In Your Dreams’ struggles to form an identity of its own. It plays things safe, relies on familiar formulas, and avoids taking creative risks, resulting in a film that is pleasant enough but hardly memorable.

advertisement

The music is one of the film’s clear wins. Tracks like The Eurythmics’ “Sweet Dreams” and the two Sandman numbers—a cover of the 1954 Chordettes classic and a sample from Metallica’s iconic track—are used smartly. They tap into the parents’ nostalgia while still landing well with younger viewers, creating a soundtrack that feels familiar, fun, and well-placed within the dreamscape.

In the end, ‘In Your Dreams’ is a harmless, feel-good watch–it’s warm, visually pleasant, and sprinkled with enough heart to keep you engaged, even if it never breaks new ground. For anyone hoping for something fresh or inventive, it may feel too familiar. But as a simple bedtime-style adventure about love, loss, and holding a family together, it lands softly—and that’s enough.

The development means that both the wrestlers will be able to enter the auction for the upcoming edition of the Pro Wrestling League (PWL).

Paris Games bronze winner Aman was suspended for being overweight during the World Championships in Zagreb, Croatia in September while Neha faced action after her disqualification from the Junior Worlds in Samokov, Bulgaria, in August.

Both wrestlers were served show-cause notices — Aman on September 22 and Neha on August 25 — and their replies were received on September 28 and September 18 respectively.

The coaches appointed for the Zagreb event were also issued notices.

According to WFI, the wrestlers, in their written submissions, termed the incident their first lapse and assured the federation that such violations would not recur.

A meeting of the WFI Disciplinary Committee on November 13 examined their replies and noted that both athletes have a strong track record of performances at the international level. The committee recommended a lenient view in light of their past achievements.

Accepting the recommendation, WFI president Sanjay Kumar Singh issued an order lifting their suspensions and allowing them to participate in all future competitions.

The federation, however, cautioned that any repeat offence relating to weight-management or discipline would attract ""stricter disciplinary action.""

Since the DRI had previous information, it intercepted the passenger upon her arrival. After the detailed examination of her baggage, the body recovered two food packets and one plastic container with white powder. In addition, the DRI also found one pellet pouch, carrying a powdery substance.

The officials also found two capsules. All of these recovered items were tested using the NDPS field test kit, and the test showed positive results for cocaine.

The contraband was seized under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, and the passenger was arrested and remanded to judicial custody.

Seized items of cocaine

The operation has added another feather to the hats of DRI, which has been relentlessly pursuing its operations against narcotic substances. Nearly 10 days ago, the DRI, in an operation called Weed Out, seized 42.34 kg of high-grade Hydroponic Weed, valued at approximately Rs 42 crore in an illicit market, from two passengers who came from Bangkok.

Even after smashing a 42-ball 144 — the fourth-highest individual score by an Indian batter in Twenty20 cricket — the 14-year-old Rajasthan Royals youngster did not seem entirely satisfied with his effort.

When asked to rate his record-breaking knock against the UAE for India A in the opening match of the Emerging Asia Cup in Doha on Friday, Suryavanshi did not hesitate.

advertisement

“75,” he said, speaking to the official broadcasters after being named Player of the Match.

Vaibhav’s 144, along with captain Jitesh Sharma’s 32-ball 83, powered India A to a colossal 297 in 20 overs. The UAE managed only 149 in reply as India began their Rising Stars Asia Cup campaign with a dominant 148-run victory.

The 14-year-old was at his big-hitting best, striking 15 sixes and 11 boundaries. At one point, he even looked set to threaten Chris Gayle’s world record of 175 — the highest score in men’s T20 cricket — before falling while trying to hit off-spinner Muhammad Farazuddin in the 13th over.

Vaibhav cleared the ropes at will at the West End Park International Cricket Stadium in Doha, where the boundaries were not the largest. He sent the ball to all parts of the ground, displaying a dazzling range of strokes against a hapless UAE attack.

NOT HAPPY WITH JUST BOUNDARIES?

In the 11th over from Harshit Kaushik, Vaibhav launched four consecutive sixes before mistiming a fifth attempt. Despite still finding the boundary, he looked visibly displeased.

Asked why, he was blunt and disarmingly honest: “I scored two runs less, that’s why I feel frustrated when I hit only boundaries.”

Yet blind slogging is far from his approach. The Rajasthan Royals prodigy, whose hunger for runs continues to capture attention, insisted there is method behind the mayhem.

“Not every ball I try to hit. I try to play my game and help the team win,” he said.

At just 14, Vaibhav appears remarkably adept at handling pressure. Each time he walks out now, expectations are high. He has set the benchmark — and so far, he has lived up to it.

There is a simple mantra behind his composure.

“It’s all part of the journey. I always wonder where I was playing a few years ago and where I am playing now. I am grateful for all this. There’s no pressure. Fans are here to support me. When I enter the field, I leave everything else behind. My focus is only on the next ball,” he said.

From an early age, Suryavanshi showcased prodigious talent in his home state of Bihar. He excelled in youth domestic tournaments before making his first-class debut for Bihar in the Ranji Trophy at just 12 years and 284 days, becoming one of the youngest players ever to feature in the competition.

Advancing into the India Under-19 setup, he made an immediate impact by smashing a 58-ball century in a youth Test against Australia Under-19s — the fastest by an Indian in that format.

During the 2024 ACC Under-19 Asia Cup, he followed it up with quick-fire half-centuries, including 76 off 46 balls against the UAE Under-19s and 67 off 36 against Sri Lanka Under-19s.

Suryavanshi’s ascent then continued at senior level. Signed by the Rajasthan Royals ahead of IPL 2025, he announced himself in style, hammering a blistering century in his third appearance — becoming the youngest centurion in IPL history and reaching the milestone in only 35 balls, the second-fastest in the league.

The team management confirmed on Friday that their leading fast bowler is still ""undergoing further assessments,"" leaving his status for the Guwahati Test in doubt.

Rabada sustained the injury during South Africa's first training session on Tuesday, which was followed by a series of medical checks, including a scan on Wednesday and a fitness test on the morning of the match. ""So KG (Kagiso Rabada) sustained the injury during the first training session on Tuesday, then he underwent a scan on Wednesday morning, and then underwent a fitness test this morning and was experiencing discomfort and then was ultimately ruled out of the game,"" the team media manager told PTI.

South Africa delayed their decision on Rabada's inclusion until the last possible moment, keeping hopes alive until Friday morning before officially ruling him out. This last-minute change forced a reshuffle in the playing XI as Corbin Bosch was selected to play his fourth Test, joining Marco Jansen and seam bowling all-rounder Wiaan Mulder in the pace attack.

Asked about Rabada's chances for the second Test starting November 22 in Guwahati, the manager responded, ""He's still undergoing further assessments with the medical team.""

Meanwhile, South Africa were bundled out for just 159 on Day 1 of the first Test at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. After captain Temba Bavuma won the toss and opted to bat, openers Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton got the team off a good start, adding 57 runs for first wicket off 63 balls.

However, a sensational spell from Jasprit Bumrah saw South Africa capitulate. He picked up his 16th five-wicket haul, registering figures of 5/27 in 14 overs to bring India into ascendancy.

Later, India finished Day 1 on 37/1 trailing South Africa by 122 runs in the first innings with KL Rahul (13*) and Washington Sundar (6*) at the crease. Yashasvi Jaiswal (12) was the only player dismissed from India, who chopped one back onto his stumps against Marco Jansen.

A QUARRELING ALLIANCE

The decision to project Tejashwi Yadav as the coalition’s chief ministerial candidate proved contentious. “One of the biggest mistakes we made was announcing Tejashwi as CM. We never wanted this, and Congress appeared reluctant throughout,” a senior Congress leader admitted.

Congress leaders privately felt Tejashwi carried heavy baggage — corruption charges and the “jungle raj” legacy. At a time when Prashant Kishor was emphasising credibility and educational qualifications, Tejashwi’s projection divided voters further.

Congress brought in veteran leader Ashok Gehlot as a troubleshooter, but his intervention came too late. At a key rally in Maurya, Gehlot read out a script sent from Delhi, with Congress minder Krishna Allavaru seated at the far end of the stage, prompting speculation of a widening rift.

Posters dominated by Tejashwi signalled that the RJD had overridden Congress. Announcing Mukesh Sahani as deputy CM candidate was another misstep: it alienated the Muslim community, and sections of the Mahadalits who were being actively courted by the NDA.

Congress brought in veteran leader Ashok Gehlot as a troubleshooter, but his intervention came too late. At a key rally in Maurya, Gehlot read out a script sent from Delhi, with Congress minder Krishna Allavaru seated at the far end of the stage, prompting speculation of a widening rift.

Posters dominated by Tejashwi signalled that the RJD had overridden Congress. Announcing Mukesh Sahani as deputy CM candidate was another misstep: it alienated the Muslim community, and sections of the Mahadalits who were being actively courted by the NDA.

GANDHI ENIGMA BUSTED IN BIHAR

The opposition campaign lacked energy and cohesion. By the time Rahul Gandhi returned from his Latin America trip, Congress had already “missed the bus”. During the Voter Adhikar Yatra, the disconnection between him and Tejashwi was evident. Apart from a few joint rallies, Tejashwi received limited support.

Rahul’s late entry also came with jibes at PM Modi that many felt were unnecessary. One candidate remarked: “Why did Rahul Gandhi jump into a pond with fishermen in Khagaria? He is the Leader of Opposition. While he accuses Modi of theatrics, he indulges in the same. Does this suit his stature?”

Rahul’s speeches on migration felt outdated in a campaign shaped by Prashant Kishor’s development narrative. Young voters, in particular, struggled to relate. “Rahul Gandhi has no stake here. Bihar is about Nitish Kumar or Tejashwi Yadav, not Prashant Kishor,” one youth said.

Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, usually an aggressive campaigner, also failed to make an impact. Her presence was limited, and she appeared to play a secondary role: a far cry from her influence in Uttar Pradesh or Karnataka.

SIR: THE WRONG CAMPAIGN ISSUE

Rahul Gandhi launched the Voter Adhikar Yatra after his press conference on alleged “vote chori” (election fraud). But the SIR issue fizzled out quickly. While Rahul remained fixated on it, the Congress failed to recognise that the message did not align with Bihar’s political realities.

A senior RJD leader told India Today: “While the contest was close, Rahul’s yatra drained our manpower. He insisted it end with a mega rally at Gandhi Maidan. Our workers were already stretched. Many carried Congress flags, but we didn’t receive similar cooperation.”

The SIR narrative became stale, while the NDA aggressively countered it by highlighting schemes, cash transfers, and the Lakhpati Didi Yojana, especially effective among women voters.

CHAOS OVER SEAT SHARING

Seat-sharing negotiations spiralled from Patna to Delhi, with tensions escalating daily. Unlike earlier years, when Lalu Prasad Yadav and Sonia Gandhi defused crises, this time there were no senior mediators to keep the alliance intact.

“Rahul Gandhi is happy with the state unit’s seat proposal. He has told us to negotiate firmly,” Bihar Congress president Rajesh Ram said after meeting him at 10 Janpath. Congress leader Krishna Allavaru, close aide of Rahul Gandhi, remained firm on certain “winnable seats”, further straining ties.

Talks eventually froze, and allies ended up fighting each other in nearly a dozen constituencies. This not only weakened the campaign but also deepened resentment among party cadres, leading to a complete breakdown of unity.

Pakistan made a rare admission during the talks, that it has an agreement with a foreign country based on which drone attacks were carried out, according to TOLO News of Afghanistan.

advertisement

The Pakistani delegation expressed helplessness in preventing drone attacks inside Afghanistan because it was bound by an agreement with a third country, the report said, citing a source.

""It was also revealed that, for the first time, Pakistan admitted to having an agreement with a foreign country allowing drone strikes, and that it cannot prevent such strikes because breaking the agreement is not possible,"" TOLO News reported on the peace talks being held in Istanbul, Turkey.

There was no clarity on the foreign country with which Pakistan has an agreement.

An agreement remained elusive even as the Pakistani delegation asked the Afghan team to agree that Islamabad had the right to carry out strikes inside Afghanistan during attacks by the TTP.

The source noted that the Pakistani delegation appeared disorganised, offering no coherent arguments and seeming more focused on pulling back from the negotiations. At one point, they even requested that the Afghan side acknowledge Pakistan's right to strike Afghan territory in response to TTP attacks, TOLO News reported.

This report comes just months after Pakistan inked a landmark Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement with Saudi Arabia in September, committing to mutual defence against any external threats and deepening both military and economic ties.

At the same time, Islamabad has boosted its defence and strategic alignment with the United States under President Donald Trump. This was highlighted by several high-level meetings, including PM Shehbaz Sharif rushing to meet Trump at the Oval Office visit, with army chief Asim Munir in a glittering attendance.

Moreover, Trump has publicly demanded the return of Bagram airbase from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. He even threatened that if it did not get the airbase, ""bad things would happen"". Sharif, meanwhile, has repeatedly lauded ""Trump's leadership"", praising his ""role in the India-Pakistan ceasefire as a historic achievement"". He even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

The Afghanistan-Pakistan talks in Istanbul ended inconclusively, with both sides blaming each other for failing to reach a long-term truce. News agency Reuters, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the discussions, reported that the negotiations yielded no resolution.

The brief Pakistan-Afghanistan war erupted in early September. Escalating TTP attacks on Pakistani forces sparked deadly clashes between both neighbours. This made Islamabad launch precision airstrikes deep into Afghan territory, targeting suspected militant hideouts in Kabul and Kandahar.

advertisement

Drone strikes and JF-17 jet bombings left over 200 dead on both sides. The Taliban reported dozens of civilian casualties, including women and children in an eastern marketplace.

Pakistan said its targets were only TTP commanders.

In retaliation, Afghan forces shelled Pakistani border posts along the Durand Line.

At least 23 soldiers were killed and hundreds wounded. Heavy artillery exchanges and ground clashes broke out in hotspots like Spin Boldak and Kurram.

Days before both countries reached a ceasefire, Afghanistan's Taliban government said that Pakistan had carried out two drone strikes on Kabul the previous day.

Alarmed by the escalation and risk of regional conflict, Pakistan sought mediation from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Diplomatic pressure led to a fragile 48-hour ceasefire on October 15, which has held tenuously amid accusations of violations.

The Dubai-based property, Shahrukhz Danube, is a 56-storey tower, featuring approximately 450 sq ft of premium office space.

“My mother would have been very happy. It is a very big honour. When my kids come, I will tell them - ‘Papa ka naam likha hai, Papa ki building hai (papa’s name is written on it, it’s papa building),” he said the event, also attended by Danube’s founder and chairman Rizwan Sajan.

Characteristically, as you would expect from an SRK evening, the event did not lack entertainment. The superstar regaled the guests with his trademark wit, and also brought alive whiffs of Bollywood magic, highlighted by his recreation of iconic moments from 'Om Shanti Om' and ‘Don’.

""I don't find myself that important that I put anything in my name except my films. Films are part of my profession and worship,” said Shah Rukh. To this Farah Khan, who was also a guest, said: “Shah Rukh has given his name to four people: Gauri, Aryan, Suhana and AbRam.""

The classic SRK wit, of course, kept coming. He said he had become ""Eid ka chand (Moon from the pious festival in Islam)... kam dikhta hu but jab dikhta hoon, kamaal hota hai (I am seen rarely, but when I am seen, it is spectacular).""

In another light-hearted moment, Shah Rukh told the audience that Rizwan wanted to have a viral moment with him. The actor then taught him his signature open-arm romantic pose from his movies. He also taught him the Don walk and his iconic 'Om Shanti Om' dialogue: ""Itni shiddat se main tumhe paane ki koshish ki hai""(I have craved you with so much devotion and passion).""

While speaking about his association with Danube property, Shah Rukh said, ""I never found myself to be in this position. But Rizwan Bhai told me about his wife, who has been quite unwell, and Insha Allah (by God's mercy) she will soon be fine. It touched my heart. First time, I agreed to this idea with what Adil explained. Their team had a simple idea: A lot of people come to big cities to make their homes. Their dreams are to make businesses and houses. If I could be a part of it and an inspiration, it would be the greatest gift for me.""

Notable amenities at Shahrukhz Danube include a helipad and a swimming pool. The project is expected to be completed within three to four years, and its entrance will feature a statue of the actor for visitors' to cluck photos with. Danube plans to expand this tower concept to other cities as well.

Shah Rukh will next be seen in Siddharth Anand's 'King', featuring Deepika Padukone, his actor-daughter Suhana Khan, Rani Mukerji, Abhay Verma, Abhishek Bachchan and others in pivotal characters.

The actor's home company, Red Chillies Entertainment, recently backed the Netflix series 'The Ba***ds of Bollywood', marking his son Aryan Khan's directorial debut.

In the Reddit post on r/IndianWorkplace, the employee explained that he had been suffering from severe headaches for two days due to the polluted air but had still been reporting to the office regularly.

He also said that he stayed back till 8:45 pm the previous day because of project commitments, even while managing his health.

However, he requested just one day of WFH to avoid aggravating his condition while continuing to work. His senior, but, wasn’t convinced and responded saying that “everyone is suffering from pollution” and allowing WFH was “difficult” since others were coming in.

The employee also claimed that the team had been requesting air purifiers for over a week, but management refused, giving “vague reasons.”

Thus, he wrote that the same pollution affecting employees’ health was now being dismissed, and instead he was told to “take a day off and still work,” which he called “absurd.”

See the post here:

Here are the screenshots of his WhatsApp chat with his senior:

In the comments section, a user advised, “Just take sick leave and let work fall where it may. Your health is most important. If the work is critical enough, they will offer WFH themselves.”

One of the users pointed out the legality of the manager’s suggestion: “That’s unethical and illegal. You can’t take leave and still be working. If it’s caught during a company audit, you will be questioned.”

The discussion continues as Delhi’s pollution levels remain a pressing health concern.

On Thursday morning, Delhi woke up to dense smog as air quality remained in the 'severe' category for the third consecutive day.

Delhi’s air quality plunged into the ‘severe’ category on Tuesday evening for the first time this season, with the overall AQI reaching 428, the highest pollution level recorded this year.

As described in the post shared by NCMIndia Council For Men Affairs, the passenger had booked two rides at once, following which both drivers arrived at the location.

When one of the drivers questioned him, a dispute occurred and the passenger took out a firearm as the driver began recording the incident immediately.

The driver could be heard asking the passenger why he was showing a gun and whether he intended to shoot him.

“Yeh kya pistol dikhaa rahe ho tum mujhe? Goli maaroge mujhe? (Why are you showing me a pistol? Will you shoot me?)”

Startled, the passenger responded that he was leaving the spot, saying “Main jaa rahaa hoon yahaan se (I’m leaving from here).”

The video showed the driver moving closer to record the weapon on camera, while the passenger repeatedly attempted to hide it behind his back.

The driver insisted, “Pistol dikhaao na (Show the pistol, then),” but the man refused. Bystanders eventually intervened and urged the driver to let the matter go.

Watch the video here:

As the now-viral video sparked outrage, users reiterated that the passenger was entirely at fault for booking two rides and pulling out a pistol in a crowded area, and called for strict action.

Another user argued that the driver’s repeated attempts to get close to the weapon could have escalated the situation, potentially giving the armed man grounds to claim self-defence.

Several others tagged Delhi Police, urging them to identify the passenger and take necessary action.

The iPhone 16 Pro is currently selling at a discounted price on Flipkart, making it one of the most attractive flagship deals right now. However, with the latest iPhone 17 Pro already on the shelves, this also brings the confusion of whether getting the iPhone 16 Pro is the right choice or if you should get your hands on the latest flagship to enjoy the most premium and best experience from Apple.

advertisement

Let us help you solve your confusion so you can choose if you should seal the ongoing deal from Flipkart.

Closer look at the Flipkart deal on iPhone 16 Pro

First, let’s check the deal on Flipkart. The e-commerce site is offering the iPhone 16 Pro at Rs 99,999, down from the listed price of Rs 1,09,999. But you can save more. With select bank discounts — such as Rs 4,000 off via Flipkart Axis or SBI Credit Cards — the price effectively drops to Rs 95,999, making it a Rs 13,901 discount and one of the lowest available deals for most users. On top of this, Flipkart is offering an exchange bonus of up to Rs 68,050, depending on the smartphone you trade in. But let’s not talk of the exchange deals because that is so dependent on your current phone and its condition etc.

So, is the iPhone 16 Pro a good deal at Rs 99,999 with this discount?

It’s worth noting that Apple has discontinued the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max to push its latest flagship, and the iPhone 16 Pro is currently available only at select retail stores. Most online websites aren’t selling the phone right now, with many showing it as out of stock. They may drop in limited stock here and there to keep up the hype. Even Flipkart is showing limited availability. So getting your hands on this flagship for under Rs 1,00,000 right now is definitely not a bad idea.

But is it worth buying compared to the iPhone 17 Pro?

Now this really depends on what you want from your next iPhone. The iPhone 16 Pro, launched in 2024, still packs a strong punch with its 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR display, ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate, the A18 Pro chipset, and a versatile camera system that includes a 48-megapixel main shooter, a 48-megapixel ultra-wide lens with autofocus, and a 5 telephoto camera. It also features a titanium build, improved battery efficiency, and USB-C support — all of which make it a very capable flagship even today.

However, what makes the decision tricky is that the iPhone 17 Pro is a fairly substantial upgrade. It brings the newer A19 Pro chip, which offers stronger sustained performance and better thermal management. The thermal management itself makes it a better choice compared to the iPhone 16 Pro.

advertisement

Then its display is brighter, tougher, and more efficient, and Apple has updated the camera system in the iPhone 17 Pro with improved low-light performance, faster processing, and a more advanced telephoto setup. And Apple has brought back the aluminium body, which means it is slightly lighter compared to the iPhone 16 Pro, although the older iPhone sure looks more jazzier with its titanium frame.

Apple has also improved battery life, cooling, and long-term software support with the iPhone 17 Pro. So, if you want a phone that will last you the next four to five years with absolute top-tier performance, the newer Pro model gives you more breathing room.

But the price matters

Of course, we cannot ignore the price. At Rs 95,999 after offers, the iPhone 16 Pro is undoubtedly a good deal. You are getting a flagship-grade device with incredible cameras, strong performance, a premium titanium build, and long-term support, making it a great deal.

However, if you want to experience the very best Apple currently offers, and you don’t mind spending the extra amount, the iPhone 17 Pro will give you better performance headroom, improved cameras, and a more future-proof package. It costs around Rs 1,30,000 which is a bit of premium compared to the current price of the iPhone 16 Pro. But we feel that better cooling and better set of cameras, including arguably the best selfie camera in any phone, makes it worth it.

From GoPro’s expanded India line-up to Dell’s earbuds — yes, not laptops but earbuds — to a massive 100-inch smart TV from Acerpure and more, here are some of the top launches from this week.

GoPro Max 2

This week, GoPro expanded its India line-up with three new devices aimed at creators and everyday users alike. The main highlight is the Max 2, GoPro’s next-gen 360 camera capable of True 8K capture, featuring 10-bit colour, twist-off replaceable lenses, built-in GPS, a six-mic audio setup and a range of new in-camera POV modes.

Alongside the Max 2, the company also introduced the GoPro Lit Hero, a tiny 93-gram lifestyle camera with a built-in light for all kinds of shots, offering 4K 60 video, slo-mo and GoPro’s signature rugged design. Rounding off the trio, GoPro launched the Fluid Pro AI, an AI-powered gimbal that works with GoPros, smartphones and compact cameras, offering face and body tracking, three-axis stabilisation, an integrated fill light and up to 18 hours of runtime.

If you’re thinking about picking up any of the new GoPro devices, you can check out these models on Amazon, Flipkart, Croma, Reliance Digital and authorised imaging retailers. In India, the GoPro Max 2 is now available at an introductory bundle price of Rs 54,999 with a complimentary 64GB SD card. The Lit Hero will go on sale in the first week of December for Rs 28,500, while the Fluid Pro AI gimbal will arrive in early January 2026 for Rs 23,000.

AcerPure 100-inch QLED TV

How big is too big for a smart TV? Well, for anyone who loves a big screen, Acerpure has launched its new flagship Nitro Z Series 100-inch TV in India. This smart TV is built for users who want a true cinema-like experience at home. The QLED panel supports a 144Hz native refresh rate, Dolby Vision, HDR10 and MEMC. It runs on Google TV with 3GB RAM and 32GB storage, while features like ALLM and VRR should please gamers looking for low-latency performance. You also get 60W Dolby Atmos speakers, Dual Wi-Fi, Film Maker Mode and a single remote that can control multiple devices.

With a screen this size, Acerpure has set the price high — but still fairly competitive compared to rivals. You can buy the Acerpure Nitro Z Series 100-inch smart TV exclusively on Flipkart, priced at Rs 2,59,999. AcerPure 100-inch QLED TV

Blaupunkt SBW600 Emperor soundbar

Now, if you already have a smart TV — or are planning to get one — what better companion than a soundbar, right? Giving you a few more options to choose from, Blaupunkt has introduced its latest high-end home theatre system in India, the SBW600 Emperor, a 12.1.4-channel Dolby Atmos soundbar that, according to the brand, will offer users a full-blown cinematic experience.

The soundbar comes packed with 17 precision-tuned neodymium drivers, including centre, side and up-firing units, paired with an 8-inch wireless subwoofer capable of reaching 20Hz bass. The rear satellites also fire both forward and upward, creating a layered 3D sound field with zero-lag wireless connectivity. The bar itself features an aerospace-grade metal body, an adaptive LED interface and EQ modes, with connectivity options including HDMI eARC, optical and AUX-in. It even comes with a wireless mic designed for karaoke, with support for a second mic if you fancy a duet.

Blaupunkt says the SBW600 Emperor will be available in India soon, although the exact pricing and sale dates haven’t been revealed yet.

BenQ screen Bar Halo 2

Too much screen time can harm your eyes. So for anyone glued to their computer screen be it for work, gaming, or a casual Netflix night, BenQ has launched the ScreenBar Halo 2 in India. It’s a monitor light aimed at professionals, creators and gamers who work in dim or changing lighting conditions.

According to BenQ, this new model uses a dual-light system with a redesigned triple-curvature backlight that provides 423 per cent wider coverage than the previous version, which, according to the brand, helps reduce contrast and eye strain. Its ASYM-Light optical tech directs light onto the desk instead of the screen, avoiding glare and reflections entirely. Users can fine-tune brightness and colour temperature through an upgraded wireless control dial, while a revamped zinc-alloy clamp allows the bar to rest gently on everything from ultra-thin to curved monitors without causing damage. The Screen Bar Halo 2 also comes with smart features such as motion detection, auto-dimming and memory settings.

On the feature side, the Vibe Clip 2 uses large 16.2mm dynamic drivers for detailed audio and deep bass, while AI Environmental Noise Cancellation helps improve call clarity.

On a dry Eden Gardens surface, tailored for India’s first four-man spin attack in a Test in 13 years, Jasprit Bumrah produced a bowling effort for the ages. Leading the attack on Day 1 of the first Test against South Africa in Kolkata, Bumrah was at his ruthless best, finishing with figures of 5 for 27 in 14 overs, five of which were maidens.

World Test champions South Africa won the toss and opted to bat on a bright morning in Kolkata. Openers Ryan Rickelton and Aiden Markram gave the visitors a fine start, moving briskly to 57 for 0 in just 10 overs. IND vs SA, 1st Test Day 1 Highlights | Scorecard

However, Bumrah struck in the 11th over of the innings, bowling Rickelton with an absolute peach. Coming around the wicket, he got the ball to land on the seam and shape away just enough to beat the outside edge and knock back the off stump.

Bumrah had made life miserable for the two openers in his first spell, conceding just nine runs in his opening five overs. The ball was behaving unpredictably, with uneven bounce appearing as early as the first over. Yet whenever loose deliveries came from the other end, the South African openers punished them.

The pressure Bumrah built in those first 10 overs paid dividends as he removed Rickelton before producing another ripper—one that kicked from a good length—to dismiss Markram in the 13th over. South Africa collapsed from 57 for 0 to 62 for 2, with Bumrah delivering exactly what India needed with the new ball at a stage when the visitors looked poised to seize the advantage.

At the other end, Mohammed Siraj leaked 25 runs in his first three overs.

“In Test cricket, if you need success, you need to be patient,” Bumrah said after becoming the first fast bowler since Dale Steyn in 2006 to take a five-wicket haul with the red ball on Day 1 of a Test match in India.

Jasprit Bumrah does it again, a sensational five-wicket haul, his 16th in Test cricket!

“Especially on these pitches. Here, the outfield is quite fast and the wicket is hard. If you are very desperate here and try to bowl magic balls, you can be at risk of leaking runs,” he said, explaining what was required to succeed on a tricky Eden Gardens pitch.

“You have to control your temptations. You need to assess the run-scoring options for the opposition batter. Every ball won’t do magic here. There are some deliveries that cause trouble to the batters. You need to consistently bowl in good areas to get rewards. In Test cricket, your ability to remain patient will be tested. Only in a few matches will you get 6–7 wickets in heaps. In the majority, you need to keep bowling well. Sometimes you won’t get wickets even when you’re bowling well. But if you keep working hard, you will have days when wickets come.”

OLD BALL HELPED BETTER?

Bumrah demonstrated just how adept he has become at reading conditions. Even seasoned pundits struggled to assess the pitch, which appeared dry and offered variable bounce from one end.

But Bumrah said he tried to decode whatever the surface was offering, noting that excessive movement with the new ball can sometimes make it difficult to settle on the ideal length.

It was a perfect demonstration of a champion’s mindset as Bumrah stressed the importance of not getting carried away by the assistance on offer.

“Yes, this pitch has a bit of help. It’s not a dead wicket. But you need to be patient. If you’re off the mark, run-scoring can be quick. If you’re not disciplined, you will pay the price,” he said.

Bumrah explained that it became easier to bowl with a slightly older ball, saying the pronounced seam made control difficult earlier in the day.

“It’s a harder ball game. When the ball is new, the deviation will be a lot quicker. Once the ball softens, the deviation lessens and then your accuracy comes into play. When I bowled the first over, everything happened: the ball swung, it stayed low, it kicked high. It’s a little difficult to understand what the right length is. You keep bowling and keep figuring things out.

“For the first three or four balls, everything happened: one ball kicked, one kept low. Where do you bowl? Then you see, okay, this is what it’s shaping into. As the ball became a little softer, it settled down; the deviation wasn’t consistent. When the ball is nice and hard, the seam is pronounced and it will do a little more. Once it softens, it becomes slightly easier.”

Bumrah’s 16th five-wicket haul helped India bundle South Africa out for 159. In response, India reached 37 for 1 in 20 overs before bad light brought an early end to play. India lost Yashasvi Jaiswal early, but KL Rahul and new No. 3 Washington Sundar battled through the fading light to ensure there were no further hiccups.

It will not be an easy task batting on this surface in Kolkata. But without Kagiso Rabada, who missed out due to injury, it remains to be seen whether South Africa have the bowling depth to make the most of the conditions at Eden Gardens.

The Rajasthan Royals star hit a hundred, and he got there in just 32 balls, smashing 10 boundaries and nine sixes by then.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi bettered his own record, bringing up his second hundred in Twenty20 cricket. Vaibhav hit a 35-ball hundred in the IPL for Rajasthan against Gujarat Titans in 2025 and set the record for the fastest century by an Indian batter in the IPL.

The 32-ball hundred for Vaibhav on Friday is the joint third-fastest by an Indian in men's T20 cricket.

Vaibhav had an opportunity to break Chris Gayle's all-time T20I record of 175. However, the young left-hander was out, caught in deep cover in the 13th over when he was batting on 144. Off-spinner, Muhammad Farazuddin, got the big wicket, leaving the spectators in the stands disappointed.

Vaibhav was dispatching the UAE bowlers to all parts of the ground. At one stage, the attack looked so jaded that they resorted to bowling wides in an attempt to escape the onslaught from the young batting superstar.

Vaibhav was gutted as he expressed his frustration on the field, knowing fully well he had missed out on a chance to script history. Going at the rate Vaibhav was going, the teenager was in line to become the first batter to hit a double hundred in T20 cricket.

However, he was dismissed for 144 in just 42 deliveries.

FASTEST T20 HUNDREDS BY INDIA

3. Rishabh Pant - 32 balls - Delhi vs Himachal Pradesh in Delhi in 2018

4. Vaibhav Suryavanshi - 32 balls - India A vs UAE in Doha in 2025*

Vaibhav finished with 15 sixes and 11 boundaries as he raced past his peers, including Priyansh Arya, captain Jitesh Sharma and Nehal Wadhera. The young batter from Bihar was on a league of his own as he tore into the UAE bowling attack, which had no clue as to how to stop the Indian batting sensation.

It was also the fourth-highest score by an Indian in T20 cricket.

Tilak Varma - 151 (67 balls) for Hyderabad vs Meghalaya in 2024 Shreyas Iyer - 147 (55 balls) for Mumbai vs Sikkim in 2019 Punit Bisht – 145 (51 balls) for Meghalaya vs Mizoram in 2021 Vaibhav Suryavanshi - 144 (42 balls) for India A vs UAE in 2025

India fielded a power-packed squad, with an array of rising IPL stars including Vaibhav, for the Rising Stars Asia Cup. Until the last edition of the tournament, India had fielded U-23 players, but the selectors made an exception and sent the likes of Jitesh Sharma for the tournament.

The mission, part of China’s continuous presence aboard the Tiangong space station, faced an unprecedented obstacle when the return capsule developed a minor crack likely caused by orbital debris.

Originally scheduled to land on November 5, 2025, the crew's return was postponed pending detailed impact analysis and risk assessment conducted by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA). Engineers determined that the Shenzhou-20 return module was unsafe for reentry and, to ensure astronaut safety, the crew switched to use the docked Shenzhou-21 spacecraft for their journey home.

This marked the first time a Shenzhou mission’s return was delayed due to debris damage, highlighting the growing threats posed by space junk in low Earth orbit.

The three-person crew, including mission commander Senior Colonel Chen Dong, remained aboard Tiangong during the assessment and continued joint scientific experiments with their relief crew on Shenzhou-21, which arrived in late October.

Shenzhou-21’s return capsule functioned as the crew’s lifeboat, allowing a safe Earth reentry within the designated landing window on November 13, 2025.

Meanwhile, CMSA plans to launch an uncrewed Shenzhou-22 mission soon, tasked with delivering additional cargo and supplies to Tiangong and supporting ongoing station operations.

The incident underscores the persistent hazard of space debris, ranging from paint flecks to defunct satellite fragments, traveling at extremely high speeds that can cause significant damage.

Even millimeter-sized debris can puncture spacecraft, necessitating updated safety protocols, debris tracking, and international cooperation to safeguard astronauts.

Despite the disruption, Chinese space officials emphasised that all life support systems aboard Tiangong functioned normally and that the crew remained safe throughout the process.

The successful return aboard Shenzhou-21 reiterated China’s commitment to maintaining a continuous human presence in orbit while managing emerging challenges of increasing congestion in space.

This armour-plated reptile lived approximately 240 million years ago, just before the rise of dinosaurs, during the Triassic Period. As a member of the Pseudosuchia group, ancestors to today’s crocodiles and alligators, it was among the dominant predators of its ecosystem.

advertisement

Described in the peer-reviewed Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, Tainrakuasuchus bellator measured about 2.4 meters long and weighed roughly 60 kilograms. With a long neck and nimble movements, it used its slender jaw filled with sharp, recurved teeth to catch and hold prey, making it an agile hunter.

Despite its size, it was not the largest predator around, giants reaching seven meters roamed the same environment.

Lead author Dr Rodrigo Temp Mller from Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Brazil highlights that although the lizard resembled dinosaurs superficially, anatomical differences such as the structure of its pelvis clearly distinguish it from them. The discovery offers new insights into pre-dinosaur biodiversity.

The discovery sheds light on the complexity of ancient ecosystems with various pseudosuchian species occupying diverse ecological niches.

The fossil was discovered during a May 2025 excavation in Dona Francisca, southern Brazil, revealing partial skeleton parts including the lower jaw, vertebral column, and pelvic girdle.

The preserved bony plates, or osteoderms, covering its back resemble those of modern crocodiles, and researchers believe it moved on four limbs like its relatives.

The name combines Guarani and Greek origins: ‘tain’ meaning tooth and ‘rakua’ meaning pointed, paired with ‘suchus’ for crocodile, while ‘bellator,’ Latin for warrior, honours the resilience of the people of Rio Grande do Sul after recent natural disasters.

Dr Muller describes the find as “extremely rare” and emphasises its evolutionary significance, reflecting early connections between South America and Africa when continents formed the supercontinent Pangaea.

The discovery offers new insights into pre-dinosaur biodiversity and the adaptive strategies of reptiles in arid environments 240 million years ago, illustrating a rich and varied prehistoric world.

Honda CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP

The CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP was relaunched in September at Rs 28.99 lakh (ex-showroom) and arrived as the most track-focused litre-class motorcycle Honda has sold in India. Powered by a 999cc inline-four engine producing 215bhp at 14,000rpm and 113Nm at 12,000rpm, the new Fireblade SP features a short-stroke, race-derived architecture, a semi-cam design, and Honda’s new Two Motor Throttle By Wire system that independently manages each cylinder pair for more precise power delivery. Its suite of electronic rider aids is extensive, thanks to a six-axis IMU that supports features such as three-level ABS with Race, Track and Standard modes, a three-level Honda Electronic Steering Damper, updated wheelie control, nine-level Honda Selectable Torque Control, and three-level engine braking. A 5-inch TFT display serves as the command centre, allowing riders to choose from preset modes or customise settings, including entering rider weight for automatic preload adjustment.

Complementing the powertrain is a thoroughly track-oriented hardware package. Aerodynamics have been improved with new HRC-designed winglets that reduce yaw by 10 percent, while an RC213V-S-inspired swingarm provides greater rear grip and stability. The Fireblade SP also gets hlins Smart Electronic Control 3.0 suspension, including NPX USD forks and a TTX36 rear shock, offering precision damping and excellent compliance at high speeds. Honda has also revised ergonomics by raising the handlebars and lowering the footpegs for better rider control, and the standard Akrapovi titanium exhaust has been tuned for a cleaner, more progressive note that intensifies with engine rpm.

Honda Rebel 500

The Rebel 500, on the other hand, was launched in May at 5.12 lakh (ex-showroom, Gurugram), signalling Honda’s entry into the mid-size cruiser segment through its BigWing Topline dealerships. This was the first time the globally popular model was officially sold in India. The motorcycle is powered by a 471cc liquid-cooled parallel-twin engine delivering 45.59bhp at 8,500rpm and 43.3Nm at 6,000rpm, paired with a six-speed gearbox. True to its cruiser character, the Rebel 500 focuses on accessible torque and a smooth, predictable powerband, complemented by its low 690mm seat height that makes it approachable for a wide spectrum of riders.

Built on a tubular steel frame, the Rebel 500 features telescopic front forks and Showa dual rear shock absorbers. Braking duties are handled by a 296mm front disc and 240mm rear disc, supported by dual-channel ABS. The motorcycle rides on Dunlop tyres and comes equipped with a full LED lighting system, including a round LED headlamp and an inverted LCD display. It was offered in India only in Matt Gunpowder Black Metallic and in a single standard variant.

The line-up spans everything from a modernised Bullet flagship to a next-generation adventure bike and the brand’s first-ever electric motorcycles under its new sub-brand, Flying Flea. Here’s a detailed look at what to expect.

advertisement

Bullet 650: The most powerful Bullet ever

Royal Enfield has unveiled the Bullet 650 at EICMA 2025, positioning it as the most potent and refined version in the model’s 93-year history. While the design stays firmly rooted in tradition upright stance, signature teardrop tank with the classic winged badge, casquette headlamp with tiger-eye pilot lamps, hand-painted pinstripes, the motorcycle receives a substantial technical upgrade.

Powering the Bullet 650 is RE’s 647.95cc parallel-twin engine, producing 47bhp at 7,250rpm and 52.3Nm at 5,650rpm, paired with a 6-speed gearbox. The new model preserves the Bullet’s old-school metal construction and silhouette but adds a modern character. The Bullet 650 will be introduced in India soon, taking its place as the flagship Bullet.

Himalayan 750: A new chapter for RE’s adventure range

Royal Enfield has showcased the Himalayan 750 prototype at EICMA 2025, signalling a major step into the premium middleweight ADV segment. Displayed as a ""Testing in Progress"" unit, the motorcycle features a new 750cc oil-cooled parallel-twin engine, an evolution of the 650 twin and is expected to deliver around 50hp and 60Nm, with a 6-speed gearbox and slip-assist clutch.

The Himalayan 750 gets a completely reworked chassis with a fresh headstock design, a new subframe, and a trellis-style main frame. Suspension components include adjustable USD forks and a linked monoshock. Other equipment upgrades include twin front discs, a 19-inch wire-spoke (tubeless-ready) front wheel, cruise control, and a round digital cluster similar to the Himalayan 450’s TFT display.

The final production version is expected sometime in 2026 or early 2027.

Flying Flea C6: Royal Enfield’s first electric motorcycle

Royal Enfield’s electric journey begins with the Flying Flea C6, arriving in the fourth quarter of FY 2025–26. Shown originally at EICMA 2024, the C6 launches under the brand-new Flying Flea umbrella, created to operate outside Royal Enfield’s legacy positioning.

The C6 differentiates itself with a minimalist, lightweight ethos. A forged aluminium Girder-style front fork, articulating mudguard, forged aluminium frame, and magnesium battery casing give it a distinctly retro-futuristic presence. The round headlamp and single-pod instrument cluster further nod to pre-1930s motorcycle design.

Beneath the retro styling is a sophisticated electric platform. The VCU supports over 2,00,000 ride mode combinations, offers continuous monitoring, and receives OTA updates. Lean-sensitive ABS, a domestic 3-pin charging plug and single- or dual-seat options are confirmed.

The C6 will launch first, followed by the scrambler-styled S6.

Flying Flea S6: An electric scrambler

The second model from the Flying Flea brand, the S6, made its EICMA 2025 debut. Designed as a dual-purpose city+ scrambler, the S6 aims to merge everyday commuting with mild off-road flexibility.

The S6 features a taller stance, wide handlebars, long-travel suspension, 19-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels, a USD fork, and chain final drive. The finned magnesium battery enclosure helps with cooling and keeps weight in check. A long, enduro-style seat signals extended-ride comfort rather than short-hop urban use.

The platform runs an in-house OS powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon QWM2290 processor with 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and support for wearable-device connectivity. OTA updates, remote diagnostics, location tracking and charging status monitoring are built in.

The S6 is scheduled for launch toward the end of 2026, post localisation and final testing.

But certified financial planner and personal finance expert Ritesh Sabharwal says the real picture is very different once inflation and taxes are considered.

In a recent LinkedIn post, he wrote, “Your 12% equity returns are actually 6.7%, and I haven’t even included taxes yet. This is a reality check that most investors miss.”

advertisement

INFLATION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES REAL GAINS

Sabharwal explained that the common mistake investors make is ignoring the effect of inflation on long-term returns. He pointed out that the correct way to measure gains is through the real return formula. “Real return = (1 + return) / (1 + inflation) – 1,” he said.

Using this formula, a 12% equity return falls to 6.7% when inflation of 5% is added to the calculation. Once long-term capital gains tax of 12.5% is applied, the return reduces even further to 5.8%, making the final earnings much smaller than expected.

FIXED-INCOME OPTIONS FARE EVEN WORSE

Sabharwal warned that people who keep large sums in savings accounts, fixed deposits or debt funds may be losing money in real terms.

According to him, “Your real returns post inflation and post-tax are likely negative,” which means the value of money quietly decreases over time. He added that many investors do not realise how much of their earnings are lost before they even notice the impact.

A LARGE GAP BETWEEN PAPER RETURNS AND REAL WEALTH

To show the difference clearly, Sabharwal used the example of a Rs 1 crore portfolio. A 12% return gives Rs 12 lakh on paper. But after adjusting for inflation and tax, the real earnings shrink to Rs 5.8 lakh.

“You lose Rs 6.2 lakh to inflation and tax alone,” he explained, highlighting how much of the return is wiped out each year.

EQUITY EXPOSURE IS ESSENTIAL FOR WEALTH CREATION

Sabharwal stressed that meaningful equity exposure is necessary to build wealth over the long term. He said that investors must think beyond short-term movements and adopt a steady approach.

“This is exactly why equity exposure is non-negotiable for long-term wealth creation,” he wrote. According to him, a mix of strategic allocation, a long-term mindset and occasional portfolio rebalancing can help protect savings from being eaten away by inflation.

Meanwhile, for those unsure of how to enter the equity market, Sabharwal said, “If you want exposure and don’t know where to start, just start with a simple index fund, period.” Simply put, start early, stay invested and focus on real returns, not just headline numbers.

The ED has issued a fresh summons to Anil Ambani under FEMA, asking him to appear next Monday after rejecting his request for a virtual statement.

SFIO TAKES OVER NEW INVESTIGATION

Earlier, the government had ordered a fresh investigation into several companies linked to the Anil Ambani–led Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG). This time, the probe has been handed to the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), the specialised wing of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA).

The SFIO has stepped in after earlier enquiries by the ED, the CBI and market regulator Sebi. The new focus is on whether there were any gaps in corporate governance and whether funds were diverted across group companies.

WHY THE NEW PROBE WAS ORDERED

According to people familiar with the matter, the MCA received several alerts from auditors and financial institutions. These alerts pointed to possible irregularities in the financial statements of some ADAG firms.

Forensic audits ordered by banks, especially after the loan defaults at Reliance Capital and Reliance Communications, also raised red flags.

COMPANIES UNDER THE SCANNER

At least four entities are currently being closely examined—Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Communications, Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd (RCFL) and CLE Pvt Ltd. More group companies may be added if links to fund movements are uncovered.

The intensified scrutiny comes after the ED recently attached assets worth nearly Rs 7,500 crore, including land in Navi Mumbai, a property in Bandra’s Pali Hill, and the Reliance Centre in New Delhi.

According to police, Vinoth suddenly began shouting that he had been given the maximum punishment in the Raj Bhavan case.

In the middle of the outburst, he removed one of his slippers and attempted to throw it at the judge. Policemen present in the courtroom immediately intervened and restrained him before the footwear could be hurled.

He was then taken out of the courtroom by security personnel. The proceedings continued under tightened security.

In October this year, the Supreme Court witnessed a dramatic scene when a lawyer attempted to throw a shoe at Chief Justice of India BR Gavai during a hearing. While the accused was being escorted out of the courtroom, he screamed, “India will not tolerate the insult of Sanatan Dharma.”

The accused was immediately detained, while Chief Justice Gavai remained composed and continued the proceedings without interruption.

Her praise marks a full-circle moment, coming just weeks after she launched a public critique of the city’s infrastructure, invited Shivakumar to her nephew’s wedding, and held a sit-down meeting with him at his residence.

FIRST, THE CRITIQUE

On October 13, Mazumdar-Shaw, in a post on X, drew attention to the dilapidated state of Bengaluru’s roads and piling garbage. She quoted an overseas business visitor to the Biocon campus as saying: “Why are the roads so bad and why is there so much garbage around? Doesn’t the Govt want to support investment?” She tagged state leaders (including DK Shivakumar and the Chief Minister) and urged better civic-management, accountability for slow or shoddy work.

Her post triggered a strong government response: ministers said work was underway and that her criticism “hurts the state”.

The Deputy Chief Minister responded by saying Bengaluru deserves “collective effort, not constant criticism” and defended the government’s work, saying large funds had been sanctioned for road repair and pothole filling.

She later faced trolling about her “Kannadiga” roots after the civic-issue call-out, prompting her to write: “I was born in this city and have spent seven decades loving my city I am a proud Kannadiga.”

THEN, THE WEDDING INVITE

On October 21, Mazumdar-Shaw visited Shivakumar’s residence to extend a wedding invitation, and at the same time, civic issues were reportedly raised.

The meeting was described by Shivakumar on X as an “engaging discussion on Bengaluru’s growth, innovation, and the path ahead for Karnataka’s growth story.”

After DK Shivakumar attended her nephew’s wedding reception in Bengaluru, Mazumdar-Shaw posted on X: “Thank you @DKShivakumar for graving the reception,” meaning to use “gracing” instead, which triggered a sea of jokes.

And now, she is backing the government’s clean-up push, saying the work on the ground is visible and giving credit to both DKS and civic officials.

She was immediately rushed to a hospital in Jigani and is stable.

Officials said the incident took place around 1 pm during a leopard safari trip. The woman, identified as Vahitha Banu (56), received first aid on the spot before being shifted to a private hospital for further treatment.

A video of the episode, widely circulated on social media, shows the leopard climbing onto the safari bus and pawing through the window in an attempt to attack her.

According to officials, the safari buses are fitted with metal wire mesh on their windows and openings to prevent direct contact between animals and visitors. However, the leopard managed to reach its paw through a small gap in the mesh and scratch the woman.

“The woman received scratch injuries to her hand and was given first aid. She was shifted to a private hospital for treatment and is stated to be doing fine,” an official said.

The park authorities said safari drivers had earlier been warned about a previous leopard attack and instructed to follow precautionary measures during the leopard safari.

In an official statement, the authorities announced that the non-AC bus safari has been halted indefinitely pending a complete safety assessment of the vehicles. “The buses will be assessed for complete safety during the downtime. Inconvenience caused to visitors is regretted,” the statement added.

Bengaluru Police arrested the software engineer for allegedly attempting to murder a motorist after a quarrel at a traffic signal in north Bengaluru. The incident took place on October 26 and was initially registered as a hit-and-run accident.

According to police, the altercation began when the victim honked at the accused, Sukruth Keshav, for blocking a free left near Ramaiah College. Angered, Sukruth allegedly chased the vehicle and intentionally rammed his Tata Curve into it.

Though the case was first filed as an accident by the traffic police, inconsistencies in statements prompted further inquiry.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central), Akshay, said that CCTV footage later confirmed the collision was deliberate.

“Once the footage was obtained, it became clear that the collision was not accidental but deliberate. The case was transferred from the Traffic Police Station to the Sadashivanagar Law and Order Police Station. Based on the complaint and video evidence, police confirmed it was a case of attempt to murder,” he said.

Police traced the accused using vehicle details and arrested him. During questioning, Sukruth claimed he was only trying to “scare” the other motorist, insisting he did not intend to cause harm. However, investigators concluded it was a clear instance of violent and negligent behaviour on the road.

During questioning, the accused said, ""Near Ramaiah College, there was no free left, but he was honking at me. I got irritated, allowed him to overtake, and tried to scare him — but ended up hitting the other vehicle.""

He claimed it wasn’t intentional, but investigators found it to be a clear case of violent and negligent behaviour on the road, not a mere accident.

The police have seized the vehicle and further investigation is underway.

For the first time, nearly 4.5 lakh more women voted than men, combined across both phases. That’s a turnout gap of nearly nine percentage points.

According to reports, women’s voter turnout reached nearly 90 per cent in Kishanganj; 84 per cent in Katihar, Supaul, and Purnea; and around 78 per cent in Araria and the two Champaran districts. In fact, in as many as 17 districts, the turnout gap was 10 percentage points or more. In all but one district, women’s turnout exceeded that of men — in most cases, by a substantial margin.

advertisement

In the 2020 Assembly elections, there were as many as 167 constituencies where women’s turnout exceeded that of men. The National Democratic Alliance won a majority of these seats — 100 in total — with a strike rate of nearly 60 per cent. The Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan, on the other hand, secured only 61 such seats, a strike rate of just 36.5 per cent. These numbers indicate that the NDA received the lion’s share of women’s votes.

But we examined another data point to test this trend further. Data shows that 42 of the 167 constituencies are strongholds, seats won by the same party in the last three elections. Of the 100 seats the NDA won where women thronged the polling booths, as many as 34 were its strongholds. In other words, the NDA managed to retain a large share of seats in areas where it already enjoyed an edge. The alliance won 66 such seats where it did not have an edge.

On the other hand, the Mahagathbandhan had just a handful of strongholds in constituencies recording higher women turnout. Of the 61 seats won by the alliance in higher women turnout seats, there were just eight where it enjoyed an advantage. In other words, the Mahagathbandhan won 53 of the 61 (87 per cent) seats in places where it did not have a distinct electoral advantage.

These numbers show that while women have emerged as a powerful force in determining the fate of political parties in Bihar, a range of factors shape their voting preferences. Among these are the social groups they belong to, the regions they come from, and their socio-economic status. It is therefore premature to assume that women have become a distinct social group, insulated from the multiple identities with which they are associated.

Turnout in 10 out of the 38 districts — Katihar, Kishanganj, Purnia, Supaul, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, East Champaran, West Champaran, Banka, and Araria — was above 70 per cent, as of 2 pm November 12.

The bumper rise in the turnout was led by an over nine per cent increase in voter participation in 25 of the 38 districts and over 10 per cent in 18 districts, including Munger, Lakhisarai, and Sheohar.

The spurt was largely led by women voters. Against a turnout of 62.8 per cent among males, it remained 71.6 per cent among the female voters, according to the Election Commission of India.

While women’s voter turnout has been consistently higher than men’s since the 2010 Assembly elections in Bihar, in absolute numbers, they surpassed men for the first time this year — 2.47 crore men cast their votes compared to 2.52 crore women.

The election concluded in two phases, and the female participation was higher in both. In Phase 1, the female turnout was 69.04 per cent against 61.56 per cent male, and in Phase 2, the female turnout was 74.03 per cent against 64.1 per cent male.

The result will be declared on November 14 and will determine if the sitting Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar, gets to form the government once again. It was also the first time that 16 delegates from six countries — South Africa, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Belgium, and Colombia — visited and witnessed the poll proceedings as part of the International Election Visitors’ Programme.

The spotlight is now on the 122 constituencies that will vote in Phase 2 on Tuesday.

Will it match Phase 1's surge?

The answer lies not in speculation, but in a decade of data that reveals Phase 2's distinct trajectory, one that, historically, has actually outpaced Phase 1.

advertisement

When voters in Katihar's Korha constituency cast their ballots on November 11, they'll likely continue an extraordinary tradition. For three consecutive elections, this Seemanchal seat has recorded turnout exceeding 67 per cent, making it Bihar's most engaged electorate in Phase 2.

Just 150 kilometres southwest in Bhagalpur, the contrast is jarring. Despite being a major urban centre, this seat saw the turnout drop to 48.43 per cent in 2020, the lowest among all 122 Phase 2 constituencies.

These two seats tell the tale of Seemanchal's democratic vibrancy, transformative growth in interior districts, and urban apathy that mirrors — and exceeds — what we saw in Phase 1.

Phase 2 outpaces Phase 1

The numbers are unequivocal. Turnout in Phase 2 constituencies has grown faster than in Phase 1. Between 2010 and 2020, average voter turnout in Phase 2 seats increased from 53.8 to 58.8 per cent, a five-point gain. That's 1.1 points more than Phase 1's 3.95-point increase.

What’s more impressive is that 108 out of the 122 seats (89 per cent) recorded higher turnout in 2020 than in 2010, a better consistency rate than Phase 1's 93 per cent, but with larger absolute gains. The pattern is clear: while Phase 1 was already relatively mobilised, Phase 2 had more room to grow. And it did.

The Seemanchal phenomenon

Seemanchal, comprising Katihar, Kishanganj, Purnia, Araria, and Supaul, dominates Phase 2's high-turnout rankings with an intensity that Phase 1's Muzaffarpur can only envy. Katihar’s district average is 64.3 per cent across three elections, the highest for any Phase 2 region, surpassing even Muzaffarpur's 59.8 per cent in Phase 1. Four of the five seats with the highest turnout in 2020 are from Seemanchal:

Korha (SC), Katihar: 67.4 per cent

67.4 per cent Barari, Katihar: 67.2 per cent

67.2 per cent Kasba, Purnea: 66.4 per cent

66.4 per cent Thakurganj, Kishanganj: 66.1 per cent

66.1 per cent Chakai, Jamui: 66.1 per cent (honourable outlier)

What explains Seemanchal's democratic fervour? Demographics matter. These are Muslim-majority or significant-minority constituencies where electoral mobilisation runs deep. Caste arithmetic is complex. And crucially, these are not safe seats; parties fight hard here, and voters respond.

Yet here's the paradox: Seemanchal's growth is slowing. Katihar grew by only 1.58 points (2010–2020), and Purnea by 1.32 points. When you're already at more than 60 per cent, there's little room to climb.

The interior awakening

advertisement

The real story is in Bihar's interior. Districts that were electoral backwaters in 2010 have surged since. Jamui leads Phase 2's transformation, from 49.5 per cent in 2010 to 60.6 per cent in 2020, an 11.06-point increase that’s also the highest in Phase 2, comparable to Phase 1's Darbhanga. Every single Jamui constituency in Phase 2 shows dramatic growth:

Chakai: 47.3 per cent to 66.1 per cent (+18.8 points), the single largest gain in either phase

47.3 per cent to 66.1 per cent (+18.8 points), the single largest gain in either phase Jamui: 50.4 per cent to 59.7 per cent (+9.3 points)

50.4 per cent to 59.7 per cent (+9.3 points) Sikandra: 51.2 per cent to 58.8 per cent (+7.6 points)

51.2 per cent to 58.8 per cent (+7.6 points) Banka follows close behind: +10.7 points, with Katoria (ST) jumping 15.5 points.

These aren't Seemanchal's already-mobilised electorates. These are constituencies where democracy was anaemic a decade ago. Something fundamental changed. Better roads? Stronger party organisation? Caste assertion? The data can't tell us, but the transformation is undeniable.

Urban crisis deepens

If Seemanchal represents Phase 2's strength and Jamui its transformation, Bhagalpur represents its crisis. The city recorded a 48.4 per cent turnout in 2020, lower than any Phase 1 urban seat except Patna's trio. This isn't just urban apathy. It's urban decline. Bhagalpur's turnout barely budged from 2010 (48.1 per cent) to 2020 (48.4 per cent), a miserly 0.3-point gain, while rural seats surged by more than 10 points.

Nawada district shares this malaise. It's the only Phase 2 district with an average turnout below 50 per cent (49.2 per cent). Three of its five seats are among the bottom ten:

Warsaliganj: 48.8 per cent

48.8 per cent Rajauli (SC): 50.4 per cent

50.4 per cent Hisua: 50.5 per cent

Compare this to Katihar's 64.26 per cent average, and the gap, 15 percentage points, exceeds Phase 1's urban-rural divide.

The competitiveness mirage (again)

Phase 2 confirms what Phase 1 suggested: close contests don't reliably drive turnout. In 2020, the correlation between victory margin and turnout was near-zero (+0.054). Look at Ramgarh in Kaimur, the closest race in Phase 2, decided by 189 votes. Its turnout? 64.13 per cent, good but not exceptional. Meanwhile, Korha and Barari in Katihar, with comfortable 10,000+ vote margins, topped at 67 per cent.

Safe seats in Phase 2 average 59.01 per cent turnout. Highly competitive seats — 59.08 per cent. The difference is negligible. Turnout isn't about suspense. It's about mobilisation infrastructure, community engagement, and whether people believe their vote matters, regardless of who wins.

advertisement

The decline dozen

While 89 per cent of Phase 2 seats grew, 14 constituencies bucked the trend — all declining since 2010. And all 14 are in Seemanchal or its periphery:

Araria district: Five seats declined (Raniganj, Narpatganj, Sikti, Forbesganj, Jokihat)

Five seats declined (Raniganj, Narpatganj, Sikti, Forbesganj, Jokihat) Katihar: Balrampur dropped by 1.96 points

Balrampur dropped by 1.96 points Purnea: City seat declined by 1.65 points

This isn't random. These constituencies started with more than 60 per cent turnouts in 2010, among Bihar's highest. Regression to the mean suggests some decline was inevitable. But it's also possible that as other regions caught up, Seemanchal's mobilisation edge eroded. Or perhaps, having voted in huge numbers for a decade with limited local development returns, some disillusionment set in.

What this means for Nov 11

The story is richer, the contrasts sharper. A decade of data suggests Tuesday will see 59 per cent turnout, higher than Phase 1's 56–57 per cent expectation, continuing Phase 2's trajectory of exceeding its counterpart. Based on a decade of data, here's what to expect when Phase 2 votes on Tuesday:

advertisement If the 2015–2020 trend continues (+0.52 points), expect a turnout of 58–60 per cent

Korha, Barari, Kasba, and Thakurganj will likely cross 65 per cent; Katihar's average will remain 63–65 per cent

Jamui, Banka, and Madhubani should add another 1–2 points; the catching-up isn't over

Don't expect urban Bhagalpur to suddenly cross 50 per cent

Nawada's seats will struggle to reach 52 per cent

Multiple Phase 2 seats have high-profile battles, but mobilisation matters more than competitiveness; expect a normal turnout in most

With a 58.77 per cent base, Phase 2 should record a 1–2 points higher turnout overall

The bigger questions

Why did Phase 2 grow faster than Phase 1?

Lower starting point: At 53.8 per cent in 2010, Phase 2 had more room to grow than Phase 1's 52.1 per cent, and it caught up

Seemanchal's baseline: Starting with Katihar at 62 per cent in 2010 gave Phase 2 a high floor. Interior growth combined with Seemanchal maintenance equals strong overall gains

Development timing: Phase 2 districts may have received infrastructure/welfare benefits that boosted faith in democracy precisely when Phase 1 was plateauing

Caste mobilisation: Interior districts like Jamui saw aggressive Dalit and EBC mobilisation in the 2010s, groups that had low turnout before

But the data also raises uncomfortable questions:

Why is urban Bhagalpur stuck at 48 per cent?

It's not Patna's wealth-driven apathy. It's something else.

Why is Nawada still below 50 per cent?

It's not remoteness. Madhubani and Sitamarhi grew. What's different?

On November 14, when votes are counted, don't be surprised if Phase 2's higher turnout translates to different electoral arithmetic than Phase 1. When more people vote, outcomes become less predictable. And in a democracy, that's exactly how it should be.

Methodology: This analysis uses official Election Commission of India data for the Bihar Assembly elections 2010, 2015, and 2020. Phase 2 constituencies were identified using the official 2025 polling schedule. Seemanchal is defined as Katihar, Kishanganj, Purnea, Araria, and Supaul districts.

What's driving Bihar's historic turnout?,"Fri, 07 Nov 2025 19:45:13 +0530",https://www.indiatoday.in/rss/home,"On a warm Thursday morning in November, something remarkable happened across Bihar's countryside and cities. From the teeming lanes of Patna to the rice fields of Gopalganj, voters queued up in numbers the state hadn't seen in seven decades. By evening, when the last ballot was cast, Bihar had recorded a 64.7 per cent turnout in the first phase of its Assembly elections, the highest ever in its history.

advertisement

But the truly striking pattern emerged only when comparing this election to the 2020 polls. Every single one of the 121 constituencies that voted on November 6 saw more people turn up than five years ago. Not one registered a decline.

In Bhorey, a constituency reserved for Scheduled Castes in western Bihar's Gopalganj district, turnout jumped by more than 16 percentage points. In the state capital's affluent Kumhrar neighbourhood, it rose by just under five points. But it rose everywhere.

THE DALIT SURGE

A closer look at the data reveals one clear pattern: constituencies reserved for Scheduled Castes saw the sharpest jumps. Seven of the 10 constituencies with the highest turnout increases were Scheduled Caste-reserved seats. Bhorey led with a 16.1-point jump, followed by Kalyanpur in Samastipur (up by 15.7 points) and Sonbarsha in Saharsa (up by 14.6 points). In Bhorey, the turnout climbed from 54 per cent in 2020 to over 70 per cent this year.

Dalits make up about 19.5 per cent of Bihar's over 13 crore population, and their mobilisation could prove decisive in what's expected to be a close contest between the ruling National Democratic Alliance and the Opposition, the Mahagathbandhan. The ruling Janata Dal (United), in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party, seeks to retain power against a resurgent Opposition led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Indian National Congress. Both sides have made direct appeals to Dalit voters, promising everything from land rights to better education access.

THE CITY PROBLEM

But if rural and Dalit-dominated constituencies saw a surge, Bihar's cities remained stuck in low gear. In Patna, the state capital, Kumhrar, Bankipur and Digha recorded turnouts below 42 per cent, even with modest increases from 2020. Kumhrar, which includes some of Patna's most affluent neighbourhoods, saw just 39.6 per cent turnout.

The contrast is stark. While Patna's urban constituencies languished below 45 per cent turnout, rural seats like Minapur in Muzaffarpur touched 77.6 per cent, the highest in the state. In village after village across the Gangetic plain, voting was treated as a social obligation and a community event, with entire families walking to polling booths together.

This urban-rural split could matter. Patna and other cities tend to vote differently from the countryside, often favouring parties that campaign for development and governance. But with such low turnout, their electoral voice remains muted.

advertisement

SAMASTIPUR'S MOMENT

Geography tells another story. When the data is mapped, a clear belt of high turnout emerges across central Bihar, running through Samastipur, Begusarai and into Munger.

Samastipur district, in particular, stands out. Of its eight constituencies that voted in the first phase, seven recorded double-digit percentage increases. Kalyanpur jumped 15.7 points, Mohiuddinnagar 14.4 points, and Warisnagar 13 points. Even the district's lowest increase, Ujiarpur, was up by a healthy 11.9 points.

In contrast, Darbhanga district showed more modest gains. The eponymous constituency saw turnout rise by just 4.1 points. Political observers suggest this might reflect confidence among voters that their preferred alliance will win anyway, reducing the urgency to vote.

This regional variation matters in a state where elections are often decided by narrow margins. In 2020, the NDA won by just 125 seats to 110, a margin thin enough that swings in a few districts could change the outcome.

SEVEN DECADES OF VOTING

To understand what Thursday's numbers mean, you need to look back. Way back.

Bihar's first election in 1951 saw 42.6 per cent turnout — modest by today's standards but considered healthy for a newly independent nation where literacy was low and democracy was a novel concept. Turnout gradually climbed over the decades, peaking at 62 per cent in 1990 during the height of the Mandal agitation, when caste politics brought millions of backward-caste voters into the electoral mainstream.

advertisement

But after 2000, turnout plateaued. It hovered in the high 50s through the 2000s and 2010s, with the 2020 election recording 57.3 per cent in its first phase. This year's 64.7 per cent doesn't just break the 1990 record. It represents a fundamental shift in voter behaviour, coming at a time when turnout has been stagnant or declining in many other Indian states.

WHAT'S DRIVING THE SURGE?

First, the Election Commission's infrastructure improvements. Over 67,000 polling stations were set up for this phase, many in remote areas. Waiting times have reduced. Women get separate queues. Disabled voters get priority access.

Second, the campaign went hyper-local. Both major alliances used WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram to reach voters, sending messages in Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Magahi. This appears to have energised younger, first-time voters.

Third, the contest itself is close. Pre-poll surveys showed a tight race, making voters feel their ballots mattered. When elections seem predetermined, turnout drops. When every seat counts, people show up.

advertisement

And finally, there's something harder to quantify: a growing sense among Biharis, especially younger voters, that the state's future depends on them showing up.

WHAT IT MEANS

High turnout doesn't tell you who will win. But it does tell you something about the nature of the contest. Historically, turnout surges in Bihar have tended to favour challengers over incumbents. The 1990 spike, for instance, brought Lalu Prasad Yadav to power, ending decades of Congress dominance. The 2005 decline helped Nitish Kumar dislodge Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal.

Whether the pattern holds this time is unclear. The current government is itself a coalition that includes both Nitish Kumar's JD(U) and the BJP, making the challenger-incumbent binary less clear-cut.

But the data does suggest some groups are more energised than others. The Dalit surge, the urban apathy, and the regional variations will likely translate into differential voting patterns when results are declared on November 14.

For now, though, one thing is certain: Biharis turned up. In numbers that surprised even seasoned election-watchers.

On Friday morning, as Phase 1 wrapped up and attention turned to the 122 constituencies that will vote in Phase 2 on November 11, the question everyone was asking was simple: Will it see a similar surge?

Voter turnout stood at around 65 per cent, the highest ever recorded in the state, surpassing the previous high of 62.5 per cent in 2000. Compared to the 2020 Assembly polls in the same seats, turnout surged by an impressive 8.6 percentage points.

Does this rise signal a change of guard or a vote for continuity? To find out, we examined turnout patterns across five major Hindi-speaking states in Assembly elections: Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana.

Let’s begin with Bihar. Historically, the state witnessed modest voter participation, typically in the 42–44 per cent range in the first three elections. The first major spike came in 1967, when turnout crossed 51 per cent. That election ushered in Bihar’s first non-Congress government. Two more surges followed in 1980 and 1990, and both resulted in regime changes.

However, this pattern broke in 2000, when turnout touched a record 62.5 per cent, yet the incumbent retained power. The next regime change occurred five years later, despite a steep 17-point drop in voter participation.

Turnout-verdict correlation

Based on recent trends, one can safely say that the correlation between voter turnout and election outcomes in Bihar is quite weak.

In neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, the pattern is broadly similar. Periods of sharp increases in turnout have often coincided with the emergence of a new ruling party or coalition. Yet, much like Bihar, a significant drop in turnout in 2007 also accompanied a change of guard. Interestingly, a record-high turnout in 2022 resulted in continuity, with the incumbent retaining power.

Has the story been any different in Madhya Pradesh? In earlier decades, a surge in voter turnout typically signalled political change. However, that correlation has largely weakened in recent years. Since 2003, voter participation in every Assembly election has shown a steady rise. Except for 2018, most of these elections resulted in the continuation of the ruling party. The state recorded its highest-ever turnout of 77 per cent in the 2023 polls, which delivered a resounding victory for the incumbent.

Rajasthan has a long history of alternating governments every five years. The state recorded a record-high turnout of 75 per cent in 2013, and participation has remained near that level ever since.

Haryana, traditionally known for its high voter turnout, registered its highest-ever participation rate of 76 per cent in 2014. That was also a year that saw a regime change. Turnout declined in subsequent elections, and the incumbent has remained in power since.

The numbers, therefore, do not present a clear pattern. Voter participation has risen across almost all major states, and Bihar has been no exception. Part of this increase can be attributed to the Election Commission’s voter awareness campaigns. While incumbents have often weathered these surges in recent years, in some cases, higher turnout has preceded a change of government.

While it has long been a staple there, the drink has turned into a global fad, so much so that people are now brewing business ideas around it.

This green tea powder, celebrated for its nutritional and wellness benefits, has found its way into smoothies, coffees, cakes, cookies, and even cocktails. But now, the internet has a new claim: it may cause hair fall, especially among women.

Such claims first surfaced around midyear but soon faded away. However, the internet is buzzing about them again. So, we decided to set the record straight - not just about the hair fall concerns, but also other potential side effects and how to get your matcha right.

PS: Don’t put that cup of matcha down just yet. Read on to find out what experts say about whether it’s truly everyone’s cup of tea.

Spilling the tea about matcha

At its core, matcha is just powdered, shade-grown green tea leaves. It began as part of Japan’s traditional tea ceremony but is now a global sensation. It is loaded with antioxidants called catechins, which help reduce inflammation. It also contains L-theanine, an amino acid that slows caffeine absorption, making it a comparatively better beverage option than regular coffee.

Broadly, based on quality, matcha is classified into three categories: ceremonial grade, premium grade, and culinary grade.

The highest is ceremonial grade, made from the youngest, most tender leaves, and ideal for traditional tea ceremonies. Premium and daily grades are slightly more robust and popular for making lattes or for everyday drinking. Meanwhile, culinary grade matcha, often divided into further subcategories, is more intense and slightly bitter, making it suitable for cooking, baking, or smoothies without the premium price tag.

But just like a coin, it turns out even the matcha story has two sides. Despite being known as a healthy beverage, its potential side effects are what everyone is talking about now.

Viral claim: Matcha causes hair fall.

Is this viral claim true, though? Not quite. At least, that’s not how experts say.

“Matcha itself doesn’t directly cause hair fall. In fact, its antioxidants (especially EGCG) may protect hair follicles and support scalp circulation. However, excessive caffeine intake from multiple cups daily can raise cortisol levels in sensitive individuals, potentially contributing to hormonal hair shedding,” Vidhi Chawla, dietician and founder of FISICO Diet and Aesthetic Clinic, tells India Today.

Now, this is where the confusion brews about iron deficiency and its connection with hair fall.

advertisement

So, can matcha cause iron deficiency? Possibly, but terms and conditions apply.

This is possible if matcha is consumed in excess. Matcha is rich in tannins and catechins, which can inhibit iron absorption from plant foods. In such cases, the body’s ferritin (the protein that stores iron) levels can drop, leading to shedding and thinning of hair.

“Low ferritin (iron stores) is a major cause of hair thinning in Indian women. When combined with stress or poor sleep, this can worsen hair shedding,” says Twincy Ann Sunil, clinical nutrition and dietetics, Apollo Spectra Hospital, Bengaluru.

Digestive issues

Tea is known to have certain gastric effects when consumed in excess. Similarly, the caffeine and L-theanine content in this green tea can stimulate gastric acid production too, according to experts.

On an empty stomach, it may lead to bloating, acidity, or nausea. To avoid discomfort, it’s best to drink matcha after a light meal or snack, not first thing in the morning. Matcha, today, is found in drinks, cookies, lattes, doughnuts and more (Photo: Unsplash)

Menstrual cycle

This, once again, is an effect that can occur only when matcha is consumed in excess. Experts agree that excessive caffeine can amplify PMS symptoms, cause cycle irregularities, or worsen anxiety and cramps in caffeine-sensitive women. However, when consumed in moderate amounts (about one cup daily), matcha is unlikely to affect menstrual cycles significantly.

Quality

Matcha lovers, take note! The beverage can become problematic if you compromise on quality. Cheap, low-grade versions may not only taste bitter but can also cause health issues.

Should Indians drink matcha?

Viral trends keep surfacing, some fade away like a whisper in the wind, while others actually leave an impact and stay. Matcha belongs to the latter. But here’s the thing: wellness and food-related fads don’t always translate the same way everywhere. What works for one culture may need a little tweaking in another.

For instance, the matcha tea culture has been a part of Japanese tradition for centuries. And there’s no denying how several concepts from Japan — like Ikigai, Hara Hachi Bu, and Wabi-Sabi - have become global markers of healthy, mindful living.

But when the same green ritual travels to India, the story changes slightly. Our tropical climate already increases body heat and dehydration risk. And matcha, being a warming and stimulating drink, can add to that. That’s why it suits mornings or cooler seasons better than hot afternoons.

Both experts point out that Indian diets are typically carbohydrate-heavy and low in antioxidants, so matcha can still offer a valuable polyphenol and chlorophyll boost. However, those prone to acidity or heat-related issues - like migraines, acne, or PCOS flares - should go easy and limit their intake to just a few times a week.

How to drink your matcha right

Clearly, the world is not giving up on the green drink and even health experts sort of approve of it. Just a little moderation, some body awareness, and you’re good to go.

Here are a few quick notes on how to match up with your matcha:

advertisement Look for ceremonial-grade matcha (lower bitterness, higher antioxidants), mostly.

Whisk gently using a bamboo whisk to avoid oxidation.

Add milk (dairy or oat/almond) if caffeine-sensitive, it helps buffer acidity. You can add a pinch of collagen, cinnamon, or ashwagandha for added adaptogenic benefits.

It is best to drink it around mid-morning or early afternoon. It should be avoided on an empty stomach, late evening and with heavy meals at all costs.

Stay hydrated as matcha can mildly dehydrate.

Don’t toss away your matcha just yet - sip, enjoy, and let it work for you, not against you. Because, as far as experts say, side effects are mostly a 'you problem' (if you over consume) and not actually a matcha problem.

As global wealth increasingly shifts toward innovation-led industries, the gap between India’s resource-driven success stories and the world’s technology-driven wealth creators has become more visible than ever.

This shift raises a critical question: can India continue to rely on traditional sectors, or must it now accelerate its transition toward invention, research, and deep-tech entrepreneurship? The answer lies in reimagining how the nation builds wealth and what it chooses to value.

advertisement

According to the Forbes Global Billionaires list 2025, the top three richest Indians, Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani, and Savitri Jindal,drive their wealth mainly from energy, infrastructure, and steel.

In contrast, global leaders such as Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, and Mark Zuckerberg have built their fortunes on technological innovation and scientific breakthroughs.

In this analysis, Mahindra University’s Rajkumar Phatate and Abhishek Sinha explore why the nation must evolve from spotting opportunities to creating the breakthroughs that shape tomorrow.

This comparison highlights two models of wealth creation: India’s resource and scale-driven approach versus the US’s innovation- and knowledge-driven model. Bridging this gap is essential for India to create the next generation of global leaders.

Entrepreneurs learnt to harness India’s mobile revolution, digital payment infrastructure, and consumer base to create scalable businesses. However, scaling existing opportunities is fundamentally different from generating entirely new industries. The next wave must move beyond leveraging trends toward pioneering technologies that will define global markets.

LEARNING FROM THE US INNOVATION MODEL

Breakthroughs in electricity, computing, and artificial intelligence began in laboratories. Success depends on close cooperation between government, academia, and industry: federal agencies fund research, universities convert discoveries into technology, and venture capital turns ideas into startups.

A culture that embraces experimentation and failure has produced companies like Bell Labs, Apple, Google, and Tesla. American entrepreneurs do more than serve markets; they create them.

US universities and labs incentivise commercialisation of research, allowing ideas to move efficiently from concept to product. Venture capital and risk-taking frameworks support entrepreneurs through uncertainty.

FROM FINDING TO CREATING OPPORTUNITIES

India’s entrepreneurs have always been skilled at spotting opportunities in telecom, retail, real estate, and consumer services.

Opportunity creation, however, requires a different mindset: investment in intellectual property, patience in research, and tolerance for failure. It demands moving from exploiting what exists to imagining what could be.

A few Indian ventures have begun this journey. Biotech firms such as Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech show that world-class science can emerge from India. Electric mobility pioneers are developing home-grown EV ecosystems. A new wave of deep-tech startups in AI, robotics, and quantum computing is emerging from leading institutes and private universities.

R AND D IMPERATIVE

India’s R&D expenditure stands at roughly 0.7 percent of GDP, far below South Korea, the US, or China. Most of this spending comes from the government; industry accounts for less than one-third. Universities produce bright graduates but limited intellectual property, while startups innovate in business models but rarely in core science.

advertisement

Building a robust research ecosystem requires stronger university–industry links, talent mobility, and a financial environment that rewards long-term risk. Tax incentives, challenge funds, and grants can encourage firms to invest in R&D. Academic institutions should have autonomy to partner with private firms and convert patents into products.

Every rupee invested in R and D seeds the industries of tomorrow, in fields like clean energy, biotechnology, AI, and quantum computing. A sustained commitment to research will ensure India moves from an economy driven by replication to one led by invention.

-----

The true measure of a nation’s progress is not how effectively it can mine its soil, but how deeply it can mine its mind. India’s entrepreneurs have excelled at recognizing potential and scaling it. The challenge now is to invent the future, making India a land of opportunity creation. If government, industry, and academia align, the next generation of billionaires will design chips, launch satellites, and discover new medicines. India’s destiny will be shaped not by what lies beneath its land, but by what thrives within its labs.

There's immense pressurere to become the top coder, top marketer, top designer, or top something.

But Ankur Warikoo — entrepreneur, educator and one of India’s most followed career voices — argues that chasing perfection in a single lane is old advice in a new world.

His viral LinkedIn post lays it out plainly: ""Your career doesn’t have to depend on one big talent.""

advertisement

Instead, he says the fastest-growing professionals are the ones building a mix of skills that makes them impossible to swap out.

This idea isn’t about becoming superhuman. It’s about becoming interesting — the kind of person employers remember, rely on and reward.

A NEW KIND OF CAREER PLAYBOOK

Warikoo’s post begins with the myth many of us inherit early: that growth depends on mastering one skill better than anyone else. The classic ""be the best at coding"" or ""be the best at sales.""

But as he writes on his slide deck, ""this is the most limiting way to look at your career.""

Being world-class at one skill still works for a small number of people. But most professionals are competing in crowded markets. When everyone around you can code, design, crunch numbers or manage accounts, simply being good at your core skill stops being enough.

So what makes someone irreplaceable?

THE MAGIC OF SKILL INTERSECTIONS

Warikoo says there are two ways to truly stand out:

Be in the top 1–5% at one skill. Or be in the top 20% at a few skills that rarely overlap.

The second is where most people win. As he puts it: ""When skills intersect, your uniqueness becomes your edge.""

Think of it this way:

A designer who can also run experiments.

A finance analyst who can write clearly.

A teacher who understands storytelling.

A coder who can speak to customers.

Each individual skill might be ""average-plus,"" but the combination is rare, and rarity is power.

WARIKOO’S THREE-LAYER FORMULA

The heart of his framework is simple and surprisingly actionable. He calls it building your edge through three layers:

1. The anchor skill: The skill you’re already known for. Your base.

2. The adjacent skill: Something that naturally expands your value — a skill that supports the anchor.

3. The creative amplifier: A skill that changes how you think, injects fresh ideas, and gives your work a spark.

This is where most careers transform. A reliable professional becomes an original one. Someone who solves problems differently. Someone others turn to.

HIS OWN CAREER IS THE PROOF

Warikoo even uses himself as an example.

advertisement

“I’m not the best teacher not the best speaker not the biggest social media creator not the best leader,” he says.

He’s simply good at many things that work beautifully together — teaching, public speaking, simplifying ideas, and leading teams.

The result is a career that looks nothing like anyone else’s.

That’s the point. You become irreplaceable when your skill mix is hard to copy.

WHY THIS MATTERS IN THE AGE OF AI

One of the strongest lines from his post is: “Which new skill makes me harder to replace?”

That question reshapes everything about upskilling in this age of AI-induced layoffs.

Instead of chasing whatever tool is trending — Python today, prompt engineering tomorrow, something else next year — the focus shifts to strategic stacking.

A human who can:

think critically

understand context

connect ideas

communicate in a way machines can’t

immediately becomes more valuable than someone relying on a single technical skill.

THE SUM IS STRONGER THAN THE PARTS

Warikoo ends with a line that captures the beauty of this idea:

“The sum of your ‘average’ skills can be your strongest advantage.”

This is freeing for anyone who has ever felt “not the best” at anything. Most careers aren’t built by out-performing everyone at one thing. They’re shaped by weaving together skills most people never think to combine.

advertisement

A small crossover can open an entirely new door, and a few crossovers can change a life.

THE TAKEAWAY

Warikoo’s final advice is almost poetic: ""Anchor deep. Expand wide. Be positively unpredictable.""

You don’t need to outshine everyone. Your skills just need to out-combine them.

And in a world where jobs, tools, and skill demands change faster than ever, the professionals who blend, and not only specialise blindly, are the ones who stay one step ahead.

They’re not just good. They’re irreplaceable.

The case stemmed from an FIR registered in March this year by the Marine Drive Police Station following a complaint by the late leader's son, Prithviraj Adik. The complaint alleged that after Ramrao Adik's death in 2007 at the age of 78, Dr Lekha, who had lived with him in a relationship since 1995, began receiving his pension as his 'widow' despite never being legally married to him.

advertisement

Following the FIR, the 79-year-old cardiologist sought anticipatory bail on charges including cheating, forgery, and criminal breach of trust under the Indian Penal Code.

Dr Lekha's counsel, Aabad Ponda, argued that the dispute was primarily a civil matter over family pension, previously addressed by the Bombay High Court, which allowed parties to pursue civil remedies. Ponda claimed the criminal proceedings were maliciously initiated to harass and defame her. Citing her advanced age, ill health, clean record, and cooperation with authorities, he contended that arrest would cause irreparable harm.

Dr Lekha maintained that she married Ramrao Adik in 1995 following his divorce from his first wife, Shobha, in 1989. She cited a High Court proceeding in which Prithviraj's mother allegedly accepted her status as Ramrao Adik's wife.

Prithviraj Adik, however, opposed the plea. His lawyer, Eknath Sawant, submitted that Ramrao Adik and Shobha remained legally married from 1948 until Shobha's death in 2022. He described Dr Lekha's so-called divorce document as fabricated, executed on a three-year-old stamp paper without notarization or witnesses, and argued that she had no legal proof of marriage.

After hearing both sides, Sessions Judge Avinash P Kulkarni noted that the case largely concerned civil aspects of pension entitlement and that there was no evidence of criminal intent on Dr Lekha's part. Considering her age, health, clean record, and willingness to cooperate, the court granted her anticipatory bail, stressing that civil disputes should not result in unnecessary criminal harassment.

Dr Lekha was released on bail after executing a PR bond of Rs 15,000 with one surety. She is required to report to the Marine Drive Police Station every Tuesday for the next three months or until the filing of the chargesheet.

The court has directed that charges be framed against all accused, including Malik, on November 18, and ordered their presence in court.

Malik Infrastructure had argued that the Enforcement Directorate’s case was based on “surmises and conjectures,” claiming the company did not exist when the alleged illegal act occurred. Special Judge Satyanarayan R Navander, however, held that there was prima facie evidence to proceed. The court observed that Nawab Malik, in connivance with D-Company members Haseena Parkar, Salim Patel and accused Sardar Khan, participated in laundering illegally usurped property, which it said constituted proceeds of crime.

Meanwhile, Malik sought an adjournment and a six-week deferment of the charge-framing process, saying he was awaiting the outcome of a criminal writ petition before the Bombay High Court. His lawyer, Taraq Sayed, argued that the ED had withheld seized documents that were favourable to the defence and that the prosecution had suppressed material beneficial to Malik. He contended that if all seized documents were produced, there would be no basis to frame charges.

Special Public Prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves opposed the request, stating that the High Court had issued no stay order. The court agreed with the ED’s submission, noting that both the Supreme Court and the High Court have directed that cases involving MPs and MLAs be expedited. It said that without a stay, it could not defer the proceedings, and therefore rejected Malik’s application.

Malik was arrested by the ED in February 2022. The agency later filed its prosecution complaint under Sections 3, 4 and 70 of the PMLA, following which the court issued process in May 2022 against Malik, another accused individual, and two of his companies. The matter has been pending framing of charges since then, with the trial effectively on hold due to the discharge plea filed by one of the companies.

The ED alleges that Malik laundered proceeds of crime amounting to 16 crore and illegally occupied a three-acre plot of prime land in Mumbai’s Kurla area. According to the agency, he acquired the land using forged documents and with the help of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s late sister, Haseena Parkar.

No rewards for guessing that.

But did you know that it also has an impact on your heart? It has been linked to dementia as well.

But what about the impact of dirty air on our metabolic health? And the link with diabetes?

Experts now say that the risk of diabetes increases if the patient lives in a highly polluted region.

""It is rather unusual because we always associate air pollution with respiratory disease, either upper respiratory diseases like coughs, allergies etc or lower respiratory diseases like infections including bronchitis, tuberculosis and even lung cancer,"" says Dr V Mohan, diabetologist and the founder of Dr. Mohan's Diabetes Specialties' Centre.

However, from the lungs they can easily get into the blood and once enter into the blood, they can damage many other organs. In the case of diabetes, air pollution causes diabetes through several mechanisms. There is increased inflammation and chronic inflammation has been linked to metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes.

THE OXIDATIVE STRESS LINK

Air pollution also causes oxidative stress, a cause of diabetes. Research has identified oxidative stress as one potential feature underlying the toxic effect of air pollutants, which trigger a number of redox sensitive signalling pathways, such as those of inflammatory response and cytokine production. Oxidative stress leads to diabetes.

""Pollution can also directly affect the pancreatic beta cells leading to decreased insulin secretion, leading to diabetes,"" adds Dr Mohan.

IMPACT ON ORGANS

Air pollution affects all organs, including the liver and pancreas, increasing insulin resistance.

""Due to air pollution people may not walk and would be confined indoors which means the physical activity comes down and this can also lead to increase in weight leading to diabetes,"" says Dr Mohan.

THE HYPERTENSION LINK

In addition to diabetes, air pollution is also linked to high blood pressure (hypertension), hypercholesteremia and other lipid disorders and once it increases the risk of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia (high cholesterol), it can also increase the risk of heart attacks.

There is emerging evidence that air pollution is linked to various forms of cancer.

INDIA THE DIABETES CAPITAL OF THE WORLD, AIR POLLUTION TO BE BLAMED?

Experts say that not just in urban India, but also in rural India, cases of diabetes is increasing and that there is a clear air pollution link to this.

However, there are other factors at play.

""It is difficult to disentangle it from other causes of diabetes, example obesity rates are going up in rural India, physical activity is going down and people are getting more affluent and therefore, they are also eating more of junk foods, high in calories, sugar, carbohydrates and fat. All of these can contribute to the rising incidence and prevalence of diabetes in rural India,"" says Dr Mohan.

A new dashboard launched by Climate Trends and IIT-Delhi shows how air pollution impacts public health, from diabetes among women to respiratory infections in children.

The findings highlight how a 30% reduction in PM2.5 levels could drastically improve health outcomes across the country.

The Health Benefit Assessment dashboard reveals a 30% drop in PM2.5 could lower the nationwide disease prevalence from 4.8% to 3%.

For women, diabetes rates could fall from 1.7% to 1.4% overall, with the most significant reductions (8–25%) seen in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam and Haryana.

Dr. Mohan explains that the connection between air pollution and diabetes is becoming increasingly clear as more data accumulates.

“When we look at the prevalence of diabetes in areas where there is more air pollution, we are seeing a correlation with increasing rates of diabetes,” he says. Researchers are now finding that polluted air doesn’t just affect the lungs — it may also interfere with the body’s metabolism.

There is also basic research being done more in animals where the effect of various pollutants, for example particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), has been shown to have a toxic effect on various tissues, disturbing the metabolism.

To strengthen this evidence, scientists are not just looking at pollution levels at one point in time. They are following people over many years.

“Longitudinal studies looking at air pollution have been able to track the incidence of new-onset diabetes in various populations. Our group at the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation along with scientists from the Centre for Chronic Diseases (CCDC) in New Delhi have shown this link in the CARRS study,” Dr. Mohan notes.

With newer tools in the growing field of Geohealth, researchers can now map pollution levels more precisely. By using GPS-based geocoding, they can link the air quality of specific neighbourhoods to the metabolic health of the people living there.

“It is also possible to measure both outdoor air pollution as well as indoor air pollution and look at metabolic health. All these research studies are pointing in the same direction, showing the impact of air pollution on metabolic health,” Dr. Mohan says.

Health experts warn that escalating pollution levels are not only harming the lungs but also draining the body’s ability to function optimally.

Over the last several weeks, almost all areas in Delhi and adjoining areas have been registering air quality index (AQI) levels ranging from ‘poor’ to ‘hazardous’ category with chief pollutants – PM2.5 and PM10 – reaching over 100 times the ‘safe limits’ set by the World Health Organisation.

advertisement

PM2.5, in particular, is highly toxic and can penetrate deep into lungs, can easily reach the bloodstream and its build-up in the body following prolonged exposure has been linked with several serious conditions including metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, neurological issues and even cancers.

LESS OXYGEN MEANS HIGH LETHARGY

Dr Kuldeep Kumar Grover, critical care and pulmonology head at CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, said prolonged exposure to polluted air directly impacts oxygen intake.

“When we breathe polluted air, the body gets less oxygen, which can make us feel lethargic,"" he said.

The fine dust and chemicals in the air also cause irritation or soreness, which affects how well our body and mind function. Over time, this can lead to constant fatigue, headaches, and even poor sleep, making people feel drained through the day.

Internal medicine specialists say the mechanism behind this exhaustion is well established.

Dr RR Dutta, head, Internal Medicine at Paras Health, explained that inhaling pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide interfere with oxygen supply.

“This means that even though a person is breathing normally, less oxygen actually reaches the bloodstream and organs. As a result, the body has to work harder to maintain basic energy levels, which can make people feel constantly tired or sluggish,” he noted.

Additionally, inflammation and oxidative stress triggered by pollution reduce alertness, muscle efficiency and concentration.

“Many people also experience disturbed sleep or shortness of breath due to high pollution levels, which further adds to fatigue,” Dr Dutta said.

Pulmonologists warn that toxic air could also be worsening both acute and chronic respiratory issues.

According to Dr Shailesh Jain, pulmonologist and chest physician at Saifee Hospital, the health impact depends on exposure, immunity and underlying conditions.

“Poor air quality can increase the vulnerability to respiratory infections and also exacerbate chronic conditions like asthma, bronchitis, and other lung diseases,"" Jain also said.

Prolonged exposure to poor air can also cause increased morbidity and frequent hospitalisation among children, older adults, and persons with previous medical conditions.

The harm reduction measures may include the use of masks, indoor air purifiers and expanding urban green spaces.

These easy, yet efficient, measures will go a long way in safeguarding communities from the increasing risks of air pollution, experts suggest.

ADVERSE EFFECT ALSO ON SLEEP QUALITY

Family medicine experts emphasise that the impact extends to the brain and overall mood.

Dr Almas Pathan of Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, said polluted air disrupts oxygen supply and induces constant inflammation.

“This means your immune system is always fighting the effect of these toxins, and this drains all your energy,” she said.

She added that pollution also interferes with neurotransmitters as large amounts of pollutants can alter neurotransmitter activities, especially those featuring serotonin and dopamine, which act on mood and motivation.

This is why people complain about mental cloudiness, aggravation, and lack of productivity due to poor air quality.

Sleep quality takes a hit as well. “Air pollution may cause irritation of the nose and throat, resulting in snoring, night coughing, or troubled breathing. In the long run, this leads to chronic fatigue and even insomnia,” Dr Pathan further said.

As Delhi-NCR’s pollution crisis deepens, the burden of fatigue may become yet another silent but significant public health concern this winter.

New guidelines demand AI-enabled screening across India,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:46:31 +0530",https://www.indiatoday.in/rss/home,"India has issued revised guidelines to confront the rapidly growing threat of diabetic retinopathy, recommending the widespread use of easy-to-operate AI-enabled retinal imaging across primary health centres to ensure early detection.

Released by the Right to Sight-India in collaboration with leading ophthalmologists and supported by the All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS), the updated guidelines arrive a decade after the previous version and propose introduction of mandatory annual retinal screening for every person living with diabetes.

advertisement

Diabetic retinopathy, caused by damage to the retina’s tiny blood vessels, can affect anyone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with risk escalating over time and with poor blood sugar control.

Once the disease reaches an advanced stage, vision loss is typically irreversible.

India currently has an estimated 10.1 crore people with diabetes, of whom about 1.26 crore are believed to have eye-related complications and nearly 40 lakh face the danger of irreversible blindness.

The new recommendations aim to transform diabetic eye care by creating a technology-enabled, system-wide pathway to boost screening coverage to 80 % of the diabetic population.

At present, 85 % of diabetics in India are unaware that their condition can impair vision and have never undergone a retinal check.

According to Dr Vishali Gupta, president of the Vitreo Retinal Society of India (VRSI), the revised guidelines signal a strategic shift toward early, systematic detection.

She noted that timely intervention can reduce the risk of severe vision loss by half.

Dr R. Kim, chief medical officer, Aravind Eye Hospital added that although cataract and glaucoma were once the predominant causes of blindness in India, diabetes-related eye disease is emerging as a major concern.

SILENT BUT SERIOUS THREAT

Diabetic retinopathy often advances silently, causing no symptoms initially. Over time, persistent high blood sugar damages small blood vessels, leading to leakage, swelling and blurred vision that can rapidly progress to blindness.

Despite improvements in diabetes care, major gaps continue in identifying and managing the condition across the country, prompting the revised 2025 guidelines to address issues such as weak integration with non-communicable disease (NCD) programmes, inadequate monitoring, limited awareness and underuse of AI-based tools.

The updated framework proposes a tiered pathway for diagnosis and treatment.

CHANGES NEEDED IN SCREENING, TREATMENT

At the primary level, AI-enabled fundus imaging is recommended for early screening. Secondary centres are advised to adopt Optical Coherence Tomography, the most sensitive tool for detecting diabetic macular edema.

Tertiary facilities should have access to advanced imaging, including wide-field systems and other specialised assessment technologies.

The guidelines also recommend including essential treatments—such as lasers, anti-VEGF therapy and bispecific IVI injections—under Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana to reduce financial barriers.

advertisement

Additionally, experts urged the creation of national diabetes and diabetic retinopathy registries to enable real-time surveillance and informed policy development.

These guidelines, said Dr Vishal Agarwal, member, VRSI, could mark a turning point in India’s fight against this vision threatening disease.

“By integrating technology, policy, and preventive care, they bring us closer to ensuring that no individual loses vision to a preventable cause because vision is not a luxury – it is fundamental to one’s independence, dignity, and quality of life.”

But the thick, grey blanket of smog settles over Indian cities each winter, also brings with it a stubborn headache that refuses to leave.

Doctors say these pollution-linked headaches are more than just seasonal discomfort, they’re a sign of how deeply toxic air is beginning to affect the body.

advertisement

“The pollutants swirling in the air, like nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and PM2.5, don’t simply irritate the lungs. They irritate the respiratory tract and cause inflammation, which can lead to vascular changes in the brain and activate pain-sensitive nerves,"" says Dr. Neetu Jain, senior consultant in pulmonology, critical care and sleep medicine at PSRI Hospital.

There is also the matter of oxygen. When the air is dirty, the body has to work harder to pull in the oxygen it needs. “Inhaling polluted air reduces oxygen supply, causing blood vessels in the brain to dilate, resulting in a dull, persistent headache,” says Jain.

For people who already battle migraines or sinus issues, smog becomes an instant trigger.

NOT YOUR USUAL 'STRESS HEADACHE'

These aren’t the familiar tension headaches people get after a long day at a screen. Those are typically linked to stress, eye strain or poor posture and feel like a tight band wrapped around the head.

Pollution headaches, Dr. Jain says, are a different beast. Pollution-related headaches are more inflammatory and vascular in nature.

""They tend to throb or weigh heavily on the temples, forehead or behind the eyes,"" she adds.

They also come with other smog-related symptoms: watery eyes, a blocked nose, or a sense of heaviness in the face. They often appear only after a stretch of time outdoors — disappearing once the person moves to cleaner air.

SO WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO?

With air quality in cities frequently dipping into the ""severe"" zone, these headaches are increasingly difficult to escape. Dr. Jain says the first step is not heroic, it’s practical.

“The first step is to minimise exposure — wear an N95 mask outdoors, use air purifiers indoors, and avoid peak pollution hours,” she says. It’s also important to stay hydrated, because dehydration can make the pain sharper.

Some low-tech remedies still help. A saline nasal rinse may help clear pollutants from nasal passages.

Over-the-counter painkillers can provide short-term relief, but persistent headaches should not be brushed aside.

If headaches are frequent or severe, a neurological evaluation is advised to rule out underlying causes. Those with a history of migraines need to be particularly careful.

A WARNING SIGNAL WE CAN’T AFFORD TO IGNORE

advertisement

Pollution-linked headaches have become a quiet barometer of the country’s worsening air. They are the body’s early alarm — signalling that what we breathe is now capable of triggering inflammation, reducing oxygen, and affecting the brain.

As winter smog becomes an annual fixture, doctors say the only sustainable solution is cleaner air.

But until then, understanding these headaches and how to shield ourselves from them is be one of the few defences ordinary people have left.

According to news reports, Pakistan-based outfits Jaish-e-Mohammad and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind may be linked to the terror module that was nabbed in Faridabad the morning of the attack.

Now, a five-second-long video of a train carrying military tanks is being widely shared online. Allegedly, it shows the Pakistan army mobilising its troops from Balochistan to the Indian border, fearing retaliation from India.

advertisement

Sharing the video on X, one user wrote, “Fearing Indian retaliation after the Delhi Blast, Pakistan Army is moving troops, Arms and ammunition from Balochistan to the Indian border. With PoK, Balochistan will also get freedom.”

India Today Fact Check, however, found that the video clip has been online since as early as April, and is therefore not related to the terror attack in Delhi.

OUR PROBE

Reverse-searching a screenshot from the video led us to the same clip shared on TikTok. We checked the date of upload, which said April 26 this year. This proves that the video far precedes the November 10 terror attack in Delhi.

We then reviewed the profile “mrbeast66” that shared the video on TikTok. On the account, we found several posts geotagged to United King, Karachi, a bakery shop in Karachi’s Badar Commercial Street.

Additionally, the video of the train shared by “mrbeast66” includes hashtags like “pak fooj zindabad” and “pakistan zindabad”. Based on these details, it’s likely that this video is from Pakistan.

That being said, we were unable to determine the exact location of the video, or where the train’s destination was. Notably, however, April 25 was right in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack. India would go on to retaliate against Pakistan with Operation Sindoor in May.

Thus, it is evident that while the video of the train carrying military tanks is likely from Pakistan, it predates the Delhi terror attack by several months — making the two things unrelated.

It was an apt name for a medical college in Faridabad. And then the November 10 Delhi blast happened.

The Al-Falah School of Medical Sciences welcomed its debut batch of aspiring doctors just six years ago in 2019. Since then, it has turned into a sprawling campus, buzzing with students, teachers, and other staff.

advertisement

The founder of Al-Falah University (of which the medical college is a part) is Jawad Ahmad Siddiqui. A former lecturer, Siddiqui is now the director and founder of approximately a dozen ventures under the Al-Falah Group of Companies umbrella. Needless to say, he did well for himself. And the thousands of students studying at his university, especially the would-be doctors, thought they would too.

But the explosion outside the Red Fort in New Delhi, which killed at least 12 people and injured many more, has not only thrust the Al-Falah Group into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, but it has also tainted the reputation of the university beyond repair. And by extension, anyone involved with it.

Jawad Ahmad Siddiqui.

Had his university not been in the news for being the hub of the terrorists who allegedly executed the Delhi blast — and who were planning something much more sinister — chancellor and founder Jawad Ahmad Siddiqui would have been planning his birthday party at his plush mansion, called Al-Falah House, in Jamia Nagar.

Humble beginnings in Ambedkar’s town

Sixty-one-year-old Jawad was born on November 15, 1964, as one of three sons to Hammad Ahmad Siddiqui. He grew up in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, the birthplace of Bhimrao Ambedkar, after whom the town has now been renamed.

According to his (non-active) LinkedIn profile, Jawad Ahmad Siddiqui completed BTech in Industrial and Product Design from Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya in Indore. Later, his family moved to Delhi.

Big dreams and shortcuts

According to a former colleague who spoke to India Today Fact Check on the condition of anonymity, Jawad became a Mechanical Engineering lecturer at Jamia Millia Islamia in 1993. But his ambitions far exceeded the humble podium of a college.

While working at Jamia, he dabbled in business and formed a few small companies with his brother Saood. Among these was Al-Falah Investments, which would eventually send them both to Tihar Jail for three years!

Jamia to jail

While at Jamia, Jawad persuaded some of his colleagues to invest in his business venture, promising hefty returns. However, he quickly became embroiled in a flurry of fraud, embezzlement, and cheating allegations. In 2000, a man called KR Singh lodged an FIR (No.43/2000) in Delhi’s New Friends Colony against Al Falah Investments Ltd. The case was investigated by the Economic Offence Wing of the Crime Branch in Delhi. Jawad was arrested and subsequently languished in jail for over three years with his brother.

advertisement

Rejecting his bail application in March 2003, the Delhi High Court noted that, in line with the allegations, the Forensic Science Laboratory in Delhi found that the “signatures of the investors were forged. The deposits were also received in the name of some of the companies which were non-existent. The petitioners diverted large funds received from the investors into their personal accounts and then misappropriated the same”.

Jawad ultimately made bail in February 2004 and was later acquitted in the case by the Patiala Court in 2005, but only after he and his brother agreed to refund the investors they had defrauded.

Faridabad college becomes ‘mini-Kashmir’

According to reliable sources, who did not want to be quoted, the Al-Falah School of Medical Sciences had a decent start back in 2019. But gradually, the college began hiring many doctors from Kashmir, primarily because they were cheap. Already a minority university, the environment on the campus became more and more orthodox following this. The management was apprised of the situation. It chose to ignore it.

advertisement

According to the same source, Dr Shaheen Saeed, who was arrested the day after the Delhi blast and has been linked to a terror module, was often seen persuading her colleagues and students into becoming more devout Muslims and wearing more conservative clothes like hijabs and burqas. In fact, she was even cautioned against such activities.

More trouble at Al-Falah

During the Covid-19 pandemic, nurses at Al-Falah alleged that they were fired when they demanded life insurance for working in a high-risk environment. Last year, medical interns were suspended when they protested the college’s poor infrastructure and the non-payment of stipends.

Jawad may have been able to weather these storms. But the arrest of several doctors working at his medical college on terror charges has put his institution under the harshest of scanners, that of the NIA.

Jawad’s birthday is just three days away. But the noose of a terror investigation is already tightening around him. The chancellor of Al-Falah may not be able to have a blast this year.

Everyone, in its aftermath, was glued to their mobile or TV screens, anxiously waiting to find out who was the person driving the white Hyundai i20 that exploded.

Then, various news channels flashed the photo of Dr Umar Un Nabi, believed to be the man behind the steering wheel, whose body was also blown to pieces in the explosion. Investigative agencies have already nabbed members of Nabi's family in Kashmir and collected DNA samples. These will be matched against the DNA found at the scene of the carnage to confirm the driver’s identity.

A fashionable buzz-cut, neatly trimmed beard, and transparent-framed glasses. Many who saw this photo of Dr Umar Nabi couldn't wrap their heads around the fact that he — a doctor, a man who was supposed to save lives — had scarred New Delhi, and killed at least 10 in the process.

Back in Kashmir, however, a retired medical professor watching the news was not very surprised, even if he was disheartened. He had already glimpsed something in Nabi that the world would eventually come to see.

Professor Dr Ghulam Jeelani Romshoo was among the four people who recommended terminating Nabi’s employment at the Government Medical College in Anantnag.

The reason was the death of a patient.

This incident dates back to 2023. Nabi, at the time, was working as a senior resident (SR) at the Government Medical College after getting his MBBS and MD degrees from Srinagar. He came to Anantnag for a three-year residency programme, where Dr Jeelani was his superior in the general medicine department.

But Nabi proved to be a bad hire.

Complaints against him began piling up from the get-go. Fellow doctors, paramedical staff, and even patients alleged that Dr Umar Nabi was not just rude and inattentive but also often absent from the hospital.

This contradicts what Dr Nabi’s sister-in-law, Muzamila, told reporters after the November 10 Delhi blast. According to her, he had always been an introvert who would mostly remain locked in his room, studying.

#WATCH | Pulwama, J&K: Muzamila, sister-in-law of Dr Umar Un Nabi - a suspect in the blast near Red Fort yesterday, says, ""They (security forces) have picked up my husband, brother-in-law and mother-in-law. They asked us about the whereabouts of Umar. We said he is in Delhi. Then pic.twitter.com/Ee7Vy4ZkQY— ANI (@ANI) November 11, 2025

But Dr Jeelani told India Today Fact Check that Nabi’s negligence cost a patient at the government hospital their life.

The patient, who was in critical condition, was under Nabi's charge. But one day, the doctor, instead of tending to them, disappeared from duty. Meanwhile, the patient's condition worsened. A junior doctor present there tried to save him, but failed. The patient died.

The patient's family lodged a complaint against Nabi with the hospital's medical superintendent. Subsequently, a committee of four senior doctors was formed to investigate the matter, which included Dr Jeelani.

This committee also included three other senior doctors from the Government Medical College in Anantnag: Dr Muhammad Iqbal (the college’s medical superintendent), Dr Mumtaz Ud Din Wani (professor of general surgery), and Dr Sanjeet Singh Risam (head of the dentistry department). India Today Fact Check reached out to them as well, and all three refused to give any further details on the matter.

According to Dr Jeelani, Nabi flatly denied being absent from his post. But when the hospital checked the CCTV footage from the day, his lie was immediately exposed. What was most surprising, Dr Jeelani said, was that even after being summoned several times during the investigation, Nabi did not appear before the committee to make his case. Finally, the committee recommended his termination, and he was subsequently fired.

According to reports, after his expulsion from the hospital in Anantnag, Dr Umar Un Nabi joined the Al-Falah School of Medical Science in Faridabad in 2023. When this doctor went from a caregiver to becoming an accessory to a terror attack, only further investigations will reveal.

The Leader of Opposition showed that Nery’s face featured on 22 voter ID cards with different names and addresses.

A video now going viral purports to show Nery addressing her newfound celebrity in India — while also taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi. In the video, she can be heard speaking in Portuguese, and many who shared it provided a translation of her words: “There’s this failed politician that lost nearly 100 elections in India, using my old pics to amplify his lies and propaganda against the ruling party.”

India Today Fact Check found that while the video does show Larissa Nery talking about her sudden fame in India, this translation is false. At no point does she make any remarks about Rahul Gandhi, the Congress party, or the Bharatiya Janata Party.

OUR PROBE

We used myriad tools, like Happyscribe, Evernote, Cockatoo, Google Translate, Turboscribe, Grok, and translate.mom, to transcribe and translate the video. The transcription provided by Happyscribe is given below:

“Gente, vou contar pra vocs uma fofoca — vocs vo rir demais. Esto usando uma foto minha, antiga. Minha foto velha, t? T novinha na foto, devia ter uns 18, 20 anos. Esto usando essa foto pra fazer, eu no sei se eleio, alguma coisa que tem que votar na ndia! Esto me colocando como indiana pra dar golpe nos outros, gente. Olha que loucura! Que doideira essa que a gente t vivendo?

A um repórter me chamou querendo saber sobre esse trem. Ligou l no salo do meu emprego querendo conversar comigo pra uma entrevista. Eu no respondi, falei pra Tata no passar meu nmero e tal. O cara achou meu Instagram e me chamou por l. Agora, uma outra pessoa que no tem nada a ver com o assunto — uma amiga minha de outra cidade — me manda uma foto. Vou colocar aqui pra vocs verem. Vocs no vo acreditar, gente!”

The same tool, Happyscribe, translated this to English:

“Guys, I’m going to tell you some gossip — you’re going to laugh so much. No, really, I’m going to spill the tea. People are using an old photo of me. It’s an old photo, okay? Look, I look super young in it — like 20, 18 years old. They’re using my photo for, I don’t know, an election or something you have to vote on. And in India. They’re saying I’m Indian to scam people, guys. Look how crazy that is. What kind of madness are we living in?

Then a reporter reached out wanting to know about this thing. He called the salon where I work, wanting to talk to me for an interview, but I didn’t respond. I told Tata not to give out my number and all that. The guy found my Instagram and messaged me there. Now someone else who has nothing to do with it — a friend of mine from another city — sends me a photo. I’m going to put it here for you, down below so you can see. Here. You won’t believe it. Oh, guys.”

advertisement

Translations provided by the other aforementioned tools were more or less consistent with this.

Besides, we also found many recent news reports about Larissa Nery. The hairdresser spoke to various news outlets and none of them featured her opinions about Indian parties and leaders. In fact, in speaking to The Print and The BBC, she only expressed surprise at how things unfolded. An NDTV report about Nery’s video also features a translation that is consistent with the translations we got using various tools.

In another video, she added, “I have absolutely nothing to do with politics in India. My photo was purchased from a stock image platform and used without my involvement. It’s not me. I’ve never even been to India. I’m a Brazilian digital influencer and a hairdresser, and I love the Indian people.”

Thus, it’s clear that the translation of Nery’s video calling Rahul Gandhi a “failed politician” is trumped-up. She said no such thing.

This Uttarakhand uni notice is FAKE,"Sun, 09 Nov 2025 01:33:47 +0530",https://www.indiatoday.in/rss/home,"Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Uttarakhand on November 9 for the silver jubilee celebrations marking the state's formation, a notice allegedly issued by the Dev Bhoomi Uttarakhand University has gone viral. According to it, the university has directed a section of its students to participate in the prime minister’s rally, promising 50 internal marks to them in return. The notice says that the event would be considered under the Bharatiya Gyan Parampara component.

Noted Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan shared a photo of the notice on X, writing, “Dev Bhumi Uttarakhand University to award 50 marks for attending Modi’s rally! And how many for shouting Modi Modi?” Its archive can be viewed here.

India Today Fact Check found that this notice was forged. The university has confirmed that no such notice has been issued.

OUR PROBE

A closer inspection of the viral notice immediately raises several red flags. First, the notice did not feature a date of issue, a common practice for university circulars. Further, the absence of an official signature, stamp, or seal strongly suggests that it was fake.

Next, we searched for recent circulars on the official website of the Dev Bhoomi Uttarakhand University and found a Diwali Holiday notice issued on September 22, which, unlike the viral circular, contained all the necessary official seals and dates.

A comparison between these two makes it evident that the viral one is not authentic.

Aman Bansal, the vice chairman of the University, confirmed to India Today Fact Check that the viral notice was forged. He also said that the university was in the process of filing an FIR with the police. Bansal also shared a copy of the written complaint sent to the police, which can be seen below.

The official Facebook page of the Dev Bhoomi Uttarakhand University also shared a post on the evening of November 8, publicly denouncing the notice as fake.

Thus, it’s clear that the university in Uttarakhand had issued no such notice at all.

Now, a video of hundreds of protesters on a road, with sticks and brooms in their hands, has gone viral on social media.

Those sharing this video claimed illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya migrants are now protesting against the SIR in West Bengal. Captions of such posts read, “See how they have come out against SIR (Special Intensive Revision of Voters’ List) in West Bengal. Illegal Bangladeshis and Rohingyas must be deported.”

advertisement

India Today Fact Check has found that the video is not from India at all. It is from the Faridpur district of Bangladesh and shows locals protesting against constituency demarcation.

OUR PROBE

Reverse-searching keyframes from the viral video led us to the same clip dated September 15, posted by a Facebook user named Biplob Biplob, who’s profile lists his location as Faridpur, Bangladesh. The Bangla caption of this post translates to, “Video clip from today’s protest.”

This makes it evident that the video is unrelated to SIR in West Bengal, as the Election Commission announced the revision exercise on October 27 in West Bengal and 12 other states and Union Territories.

India Today Fact Check reached out to Biplob, who confirmed that the video is from the Bhanga area of Faridpur district in Bangladesh. He mentioned that a series of protests took place in the Bhanga upazila against the Election Commission's decision on constituency demarcation.

We also found several reports published in Bangladeshi outlets like The Business Standard, The Daily Star, and The Dhaka Tribune in September that said the Election Commission of Bangladesh issued a gazette notification redrawing the boundaries of 46 constituencies across the country. This decision led to widespread protests in several districts.

According to Biplob, “This decision has hurt the livelihood of the locals as the distance to the nearest administrative office has now become nearly 40 km. For the time being, we have paused our protest as a case has been registered against this demarcation in court.”

Therefore, it is abundantly clear that the video is not from India and not related to the SIR in West Bengal.

Cut to today: BJP wins Bihar and becomes the single largest party in the state.





What went wrong in 2024





The quick rebound





Haryana: Sweep, stumble, resurge



Maharashtra: Collapse and rebound





Delhi: A victory 27 years in waiting





Bihar - The 'garda uda dia' victory





How did BJP do it?





On June 4, 2024, as the results started trickling in, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was in shock. The party had set the ambitious “400 paar” target for itself in the Lok Sabha elections. However, the party failed to get a majority on its own for the first time since 2014.The scale of the setback raised a fundamental question - was the “Modi‑magic” past its peak? After all, in an electoral career of 22 years, for the first time, PM Modi didn’t have a clear majority.Within a few months of 2024 elections, BJP flipped the script, giving a masterclass on how to win elections. In the key state elections in Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Delhi and now Bihar, the BJP-led NDA has won four states. With 4 out of 6 wins, the party has shown that the 2024 Lok Sabha was merely a one‑off aberration.The BJP’s 2024 setback stemmed largely from internal drift and an unexpected rift with the RSS. JP Nadda’s remark that “the BJP runs itself” unsettled the Sangh and led to reduced booth-level mobilisation, weakening the party’s traditional grassroots strength. This disconnect was compounded by a sense of complacency after years of dominance.BJP's internal assesments suggested eroded last-mile outreach, softer booth activity, and an overreliance on centralised leadership-centric messaging. Pollsters amplified this miscalibration by projecting an inflated performance, leading to misallocated resources and an underestimation of local grievances among communities such as non-Yadav OBCs, Brahmins, and SC/EBC groups.The first big test for BJP after the 2024 setback was the Haryana state assembly elections. Facing a steep 10-year anti-incumbency against Manohar Khattar, the saffron party changed its CM just before the polls and brought in Nayab Saini. The party wooed women voters by launching 'Lado Lakshmi Yojana'.A few months later, in October, as the final test started, BJP registered an impressive win. Where a revival for Congress was expected, BJP secured 48 of 90 seats, with 39.94 per cent vote share versus Congress’s 39.09 per cent.In Lok Sabha polls after UP, if BJP suffered its biggest loss in any state, it was in Maharashtra. In 2019, the BJP‑led alliance had secured 41 of 48 seats (BJP 23). By 2024, the tally plunged - BJP got only about 9 seats, the NDA just 17.But the November state polls brought a sharp reversal. The BJP‑led Mahayuti won 235 of 288 seats, making the alliance more dominant than ever before. The BJP alone won 132, securing 26.78 per cent vote share, its best-ever performance in the state. Analysts attributed the turnaround to a large‑scale revival of booth‑level work, re‑engagement of the RSS structure, and targeted messaging addressing coalition dynamics and local issues. Eknath Shinde's 'Ladki Behin Yojana' once again played a big role.Soon after Maharashtra, it was the turn of Delhi where BJP had been in exile for 27 years. But BJP managed to win 47 of 70 seats, ending the decade‑long rule of the Aam Aadmi Party. After the 2024 Lok Sabha setback, winning a major urban contest became essential for signalling broader bounce‑back and BJP delivered it in Delhi.In all the state elections that followed 2024 elections, Bihar was the most testing, as BJP allied with Nitish Kumar who himself was fighting anti-incumbency of 20 years and voter fatigue. On the other hand, Tejashwi, who had managed to lead RJD as the single largest party the last time in 2020, was named the CM candidate of the Mahagathbandhan.The opposition led the charge while making “vote-theft” and SIR the main attack points against the ruling coalition.But on Friday the NDA recorded its second-best in Bihar with 206 seats. BJP itself almost bested its best performance in the state with 90 seats against 91 from 2010.BJP has mastered the art of deflecting the build-up anti-incumbency against being years in governance, to scratching the social hegemonic memories and using it as a launch pad for presenting themselves and an alternative to it, though already being in power.In Haryana they did it by reminding the masses about the Jaat dominance, and consolidating the non-jaat votes, creating a counter polarisation against the very deeply rooted jaat politics of the state and backed it up by giving a Punjabi Khatri and then an OBC CM.Maharashtra was no different, where despite having a strong Maratha face in incumbent CM Eknath Shinde, BJP played on anti-Maratha plank, creating a wider caste coalition, at a time when Manoj Jarange Patil’s demand for Maratha reservation had a huge resonance in Maratha region of the state. The BJP-led Mahayuti won 37 of the region’s 46 seats.In Bihar, BJP/NDA made concerted efforts to bring back the memories of “jungle raj” that worked effectively.The biggest strength of the party has been its organisational skills and ground workers who effectively mobilise the voters. PM Modi's personal guarantees and the idea of a ""double-engine"" government have also worked in favour of BJP.With Bihar giving an astonishing victory to BJP, the party has yet another state in its kitty. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his victory speech to the BJP workers, has already set the next agenda- 2026 Bengal polls.Will BJP continue its winning streak, keeping 2024 as just a minor setback, we will know in coming months.",2025-11-14T17:29:27.852296

The decline

What went wrong?

What next for Left?

NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan stands dismantled in Bihar — and its constituent parties have fared no better on their own. While the two larger players, the RJD in Bihar and the Congress at the national level, will regroup and continue the fight, the real setback has been for the three Left parties.In 2020, they delivered an impressive 16 seats to the alliance’s tally of 110. This time, however, they could not even reach double digits collectively. The scale of this decline raises a deeper question: where does the Left go from here?Five years ago, it was the Congress that denied RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav a shot at the chief minister’s post. While the grand old party won 19 of the 70 seats it contested, the Left parties performed far better, fielding 29 candidates and winning 16.The CPI(ML) Liberation had delivered the strongest showing, with 12 wins from 19 seats — a strike rate of 63 per cent. The CPI and CPI(M) added two seats each, contesting six and four constituencies, respectively.This time, however, the picture is starkly different. With counting in its final stages, the CPI(ML) Liberation has won only two seats and the CPI(M) just one — neither is leading anywhere else. The CPI, meanwhile, has been wiped out entirely.The drop in vote share, however, is marginal. The Left front has slipped only slightly — from 4.64 per cent in 2020 to 4.18 per cent this time (with counting still underway).The election effectively became a referendum on the 20-year tenure of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar — and the JD(U) chief passed with flying colours. Powered significantly by his core support base of women voters — whose turnout across both phases was nearly nine percentage points higher than that of men — the NDA delivered a performance reminiscent of its sweeping 2010 victory.The Mahagathbandhan’s collapse was also fuelled by its own disunity. With each constituent staking claims to a larger share of seats, the alliance never finalised a formal seat-sharing pact. The CPI(M) and CPI together sought 35 seats — 24 and 11, respectively — six more than what the three Left parties had contested collectively in 2020. Ultimately, the Left fielded 33 candidates: 20 from CPI(ML) Liberation, nine from CPI and four from CPI(M).Despite fighting under a common banner and projecting Tejashwi Yadav as their chief ministerial face, the partners never achieved real coherence on the ground — and each paid the price.Having already lost its traditional strongholds of West Bengal (2011) and Tripura (2018) — states it had governed for decades — the Left Front now remains in power only in Kerala . There too, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who made history by leading the Left Democratic Front (LDF) to re-election in 2021 and breaking the state’s pattern of alternating governments, will have completed a decade in office by the time Kerala votes again in 2026.Ironically, the Left’s main challenger in Kerala will be its current ally in Bihar — the Congress, which heads the opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) in the southern state.",2025-11-14T17:29:29.540411

First-Time Woman Voter in Danapur Explains Why Nitish Kumar Scored Massive Landslide Win in Bihar

The surge that came from women voters

What worked for NDA

Support built on more than a single benefit

Women voters made their weight felt

In the 2025 Bihar election, two headline-grabbing outcomes have captured the spotlight: a sweeping victory for the National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) and a record voter turnout unseen in more than seventy years. Yet, the most defining aspect of this election may well be who turned out to vote and in what numbers.What sets the 2025 election apart is not just the NDA’s big win, but the historic rise in turnout among Bihar ’s women voters.For the first time in Bihar’s history, women not only outnumbered men at the polling booths but also shattered turnout records. While the overall turnout stood at 66.91 per cent, an extraordinary 71.6 per cent of women cast their votes, nearly nine percentage points higher than the 62.8 per cent turnout among men. In sheer numbers, women outvoted men, marking a historic first for the state and signaling a potential to transform Bihar’s political landscape.Women voters took the lead in what the Election Commission of India described as Bihar’s highest-ever voter turnout, with 71.6 per cent of female electors casting their ballots compared to 62.8 per cent of men. In the first phase of voting, 69.04 per cent of women turned out to vote, well above the 61.56 per cent male turnout.The trend strengthened in the second phase, when 74.03 per cent of women voters exercised their franchise, again surpassing the 64.1 per cent turnout among men. Overall, Bihar recorded a 66.91 per cent voter turnout — the highest since the state’s first elections in 1951 — with women driving the surge in participation.Women were the biggest winners of the Bihar elections. Their overwhelming participation tilted the mandate toward the NDA, boosted by welfare schemes for women. One of the most talked-about schemes before the election was the Rs 10,000 assistance for women wanting to start small enterprises.The contrast between the two alliances was simple: the NDA had already delivered the benefit, while the Mahagathbandhan’s offer remained a campaign promise. For many women, that difference, money already in the bank versus a promise of future help, mattered.But the support for Nitish Kumar among women wasn’t built in a single election cycle. It rests on a much longer foundation. Over nearly two decades in power, Nitish’s government has consistently introduced policies aimed at women — from panchayati raj reservations to the Jeevika self-help group movement. These measures expanded women’s economic roles and strengthened their presence in local governance.That background helped the NDA’s 2025 pitch land more strongly. The women employment scheme targeting 22 lakh women, the plan to create one crore ‘Lakhpati Didis’, and the Mission Crorepati push for women-led enterprises all fed into a familiar narrative of economic empowerment. Unlike the opposition’s focus on direct cash transfers, the NDA leaned on a mix of skills, credit access and SHG-driven growth, positioning women as central to Bihar’s development story.The 2025 Bihar election offers one of the clearest instances of women emerging as a defining voting group in the state. With their turnout nearly nine percentage points higher than that of men, women clearly influenced the direction of the mandate.As the dust settles on the 2025 election, one thing is certain: Bihar’s women are no longer silent spectators. They are active, influential, and, for the first time, decisive in shaping the state’s political destiny. The scale of their participation has not only shifted the composition of the electorate but also the direction of Bihar’s future. For the NDA, this historic mandate is as much a victory for its policies as it is for the women who turned out in record numbers to support them. And for Bihar, it marks the dawn of a new era, one where women’s voices are not just heard, but heeded.",2025-11-14T17:29:32.837823

NEW DELHI: Many surprising wins and losses marked Friday's results as Bihar finalised its mandate, delivering a sweeping victory to the NDA and extending its nearly two-decade-long dominance under chief minister Nitish Kumar, who has switched alliances several times over the years very conveniently.What was expected to be a close contest between the ruling NDA and the opposition Mahagathbandhan instead turned into a decisive, one-sided mandate. The NDA is poised to comfortably cross the 200-seat mark in the 243-member assembly, while the Mahagathbandhan has collapsed to under 40 seats.The grand old party -- Congress, once a major force in the state, has been reduced to a near-wipeout, winning hardly about 10 per cent of the 61 seats it contested.The verdict also produced several striking wins and unexpected defeats across Bihar. While JD(U) strongman Anant Singh retained his bastion, many prominent figures in Patna failed to secure victories.Mahagathbandhan’s chief ministerial face and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav eventually retained his family stronghold of Raghopur in Vaishali district after a tense, fluctuating contest. Throughout the day, he alternated between leads and trails, making the outcome far from the comfortable victory his family traditionally enjoyed from this seat.In 2020, Tejashwi had secured Raghopur with ease. He won again this time, but without the dominance that pollsters or supporters expected.JD(U) heavyweight Anant Singh once again proved his unshakable hold over Mokama. Despite being jailed in connection with the recent killing of Jan Suraaj worker Dular Chand Yadav and facing repeated allegations of muscle power, Singh secured yet another victory.Just days before polling, he was taken into custody in the same case, yet voters reaffirmed their trust in him as they have many times before. Known for his trademark sunglasses and brief, punchy remarks to the media, Singh emerged victorious even from behind bars.Folk singer and influencer Maithili Thakur, contesting her first election on a BJP ticket, won comfortably from Alinagar by more than 11,000 votes, defeating veteran RJD leader Binod Mishra. This makes her the youngest MLA in the Bihar assembly.The BJP’s gamble on her reach and cultural appeal paid off—the party has won this seat for the first time since 2008. Alinagar, in Darbhanga district and part of the Darbhanga Lok Sabha constituency, saw a three-way contest involving Thakur, Mishra, and Jan Suraaj’s Biplaw Chaudhary.Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav, fielded by the BJP from Chapra in Saran district, failed to convert his popularity into votes. Unlike other film stars who transitioned successfully into politics—such as Ravi Kishan, Manoj Tiwari, or Dinesh Lal “Nirahua” Yadav—Khesari struggled from the beginning.He eventually lost by over 10,000 votes to BJP’s Chhoti Kumari. For the RJD, which had backed him despite his limited political experience, his defeat was a major embarrassment.Tej Pratap Yadav, son of former CM Lalu Prasad Yadav , estranged from the RJD, and founder of the Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD) suffered a significant defeat in Mahua. Contesting from the same district as his brother Tejashwi and from a seat he once held, Tej Pratap was unable to mobilise support for his new party, resulting in a heavy loss.In Simri Bakhtiarpur, RJD leader and sitting MLA Yusuf Salahuddin, son of veteran politician and former parliamentarian Mehboob Ali Kaiser, was defeated by Sanjay Kumar Singh of the Chirag Paswan-led LJP (RV). Sanjay won by more than 7,000 votes, marking another high-profile setback for the RJD.",2025-11-14T17:29:34.487571

Six Ways Nitish Kumar Proved 'Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai' As NDA Registers Big Win in Bihar Assembly Polls

In Bihar, 'Nitishe' Kumar!

AIMIM dents Mahagathbandhan

What went for the opposition?

NEW DELHI: The Bihar election results on Friday upended every forecast and humbled every pollster as Magadh delivered a sweeping mandate to the Nitish Kumar-led NDA. The verdict was so emphatic that it pushed the oppositionto the brink of Bihar's political canvas, redrawing the state’s electoral landscape in a single stroke.When the results began trickling in the morning, the contest seemed neck-to-neck in the early trends.However, what seemed like the contest soon started fading before turning into a race in the opposite direction, with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) scaling upward and the Mahagathbandhan dipping downward.The mandate in NDA’s favour was so overwhelming that it effectively redrew Bihar’s political map.Constituencies that glowed green in 2020, when the RJD was the single largest party, were this time engulfed by the NDA's hue.NDA did not just win. It delivered a demonstration of how disciplined coalitions, targeted welfare, and carefully stitched caste alliances can overwhelm fragmented opponents in India’s first-past-the-post system.At the centre of this churn stands Nitish Kumar , once again proving his unmatched durability. With the NDA sweeping more than two-thirds of the assembly, Kumar looks set for a tenth term, reinforced by the same formula of clean governance that has defined his political longevity.What many dismissed as voter fatigue turned out to be misplaced. Prohibition, policing reforms, and a long arc of women-focused welfare ensured his personal goodwill remained intact. Modi-Nitish, often dismissed as old warhorses, outmanoeuvred the younger pairing of Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav with ease.As OBC and EBC voters consolidated behind Nitish Kumar, Prime Minister Modi’s high-octane campaign energised women, youth and swing voters, creating a broad coalition that decisively tilted the mandate in the NDA’s favour.Women voters, in particular, played a decisive role. Higher female turnout in regions like Mithila, Kosi and Magadh translated into clear gains for the NDA. Free ration assurances, Jeevika linkages and the bicycle-to-scooter progression for girls resonated more strongly than the Mahagathbandhan’s job promises.In rural pockets, elderly women openly credited these schemes for their loyalty, strengthening JD(U)’s hold over EBC and Mahadalit segments.The NDA’s cohesive social arithmetic sharply contrasted with the opposition’s fragmentation. The alliance’s vote consolidation reduced the effective number of competing parties to under 2.7, helping convert a moderate vote lead into a towering seat advantage. Chirag Paswan’s mobilisation of Paswan voters and the BJP’s outreach to non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs tightened this consolidation further.Meanwhile, the Mahagathbandhan’s once formidable caste equation cracked. The RJD held on to its Yadav-Muslim nucleus but failed to break into the wider OBC base that powered Nitish’s coalition.Even in Seemanchal, long regarded as an opposition stronghold, the NDA carried several Muslim-majority seats with Muslim candidates, eroding the bloc’s monopoly claim. AIMIM’s 5-6 seats and strong vote shares in others further splintered the minority vote, costing the alliance several close contests.The Congress emerged as the weakest link. With barely four wins from 61 seats and a dismal strike rate, the party dragged the entire coalition downward. Poor coordination, ineffective candidate selection, and limited campaign visibility reduced it to a burden rather than a partner, raising tough questions about its usefulness in future INDIA bloc formations.Smaller players compounded the opposition’s troubles. Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj secured a respectable 3.5 percent vote share but translated it into zero victories, acting inadvertently as a spoiler in multiple seats. Kishor’s ambitious padyatra created noise but failed to pierce the state’s deeply embedded caste-welfare ecosystem.The Mahagathbandhan’s campaign struggled to present a credible governance alternative. Its messaging leaned heavily on unemployment, voter list controversies and anti-establishment rhetoric while failing to counter the NDA’s development narrative rooted in central schemes and Nitish’s sushasan imprint.Tejashwi Yadav’s rallies drew enthusiasm, particularly from young voters, but the alliance’s lack of narrative coherence and credibility gaps on governance kept it on the defensive.The Bihar verdict is more than an electoral outcome. It is a reminder that political storytelling means little without organisational discipline, credible leadership and a welfare apparatus that reaches the last voter.Nitish Kumar’s NDA succeeded because it understood the state’s social circuitry better than its rivals and turned that understanding into a finely tuned electoral machine. The Mahagathbandhan, weighed down by internal confusion and an eroding caste coalition, simply could not keep pace.For the INDIA bloc, Bihar is not just a setback. It is a flashing red signal. Unless the alliance repairs its credibility deficit, rebuilds grassroots networks and speaks in one coherent voice, it risks becoming electorally irrelevant long before the next electoral test arrives.",2025-11-14T17:29:36.131246

Six Ways Nitish Kumar Proved 'Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai' As NDA Registers Big Win in Bihar Assembly Polls

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday took a sharp dig at the Congress, remarking that the party had turned into “MMC” — the “Muslim League Maowadi Congress.”He made the comment during his victory address at the BJP headquarters after the Bihar assembly election results were declared. The BJP-led NDA registered a sweeping win over the Mahagathbandhan, of which the Congress is a key constituent.“I say this with full seriousness — the Congress has now become the Muslim League Maowadi Congress, or MMC,” the prime minister said, adding that ""internal divisions"" would soon lead to a ""split"" within the party.""A faction within the Congress is uncomfortable with the party's negative politics. Anger is brewing against the 'Naamdaar' (a reference to Rahul Gandhi) for the path he is taking the Congress on.Therefore, I fear that there could be another major split in the Congress,"" PM Modi added.PM Modi further remarked that even the Congress’s allies have begun to realise that its “negative politics” is damaging them as well.“Earlier as well, from this very stage, I had cautioned Congress’ allies that it is a 'liability' — a parasite that tries to absorb its partners’ vote bank for its own gain. That is why they should remain vigilant,” he stated.In the Bihar assembly elections held on November 6 and 11, the BJP and its NDA allies swept more than 200 of the state’s 243 constituencies. The saffron party is now poised to emerge as the single largest party in Bihar for the first time.In sharp contrast, the Congress and its Mahagathbandhan partners struggled to cross even the 50-seat mark. As counting neared completion, the Congress had not won a single seat and was leading in only six constituencies.",2025-11-14T17:29:37.776401

Six Ways Nitish Kumar Proved 'Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai' As NDA Registers Big Win in Bihar Assembly Polls

JD(U) posts solid gains, maintains relevance in NDA fold



Mahagathbandhan falters despite broad base



NEW DELHI: The National Democratic Alliance registered a resounding victory in the Bihar assembly elections on Friday, securing a combined tally of 202 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party alone accounted for 90 seats, reaffirming its expanding political footprint in the state. The results mark one of the strongest showings for the NDA in recent cycles, reshaping the political map and dealing a major blow to the Mahagathbandhan.The BJP delivered the most decisive performance of the election, winning 76 seats and leading in 14, bringing its total to 90. With a strike rate of nearly 90 per cent across the seats it fought, the party significantly outperformed all alliances and allies, further strengthening its influence in regions where it has traditionally been competitive and expanding into pockets where it previously faced stiff contest.Its strong showing is expected to reshape leadership negotiations within the NDA, given its numerical dominance.Despite a tough electoral battle, Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) emerged with a respectable tally, winning 61 seats and leading in 24, totalling 85. Its strike rate indicates that the party managed to hold on to its core support base across rural and semi-urban belts, particularly among EBC, Kurmi and Koeri communities.The JD(U)’s performance ensures it remains a significant player within the coalition, even as the BJP takes a larger share of the NDA’s mandate.The Mahagathbandhan, comprising the RJD, Congress, VIP and Left parties, fell sharply behind the NDA despite contesting a larger share of seats.The RJD, leading the alliance and contesting 143 seats, managed to win only 24, marking one of its weakest electoral outcomes in recent years. The Congress, which fought for 61 seats, secured just 6 wins.The VIP, contesting 14 seats, failed to win a single constituency, while the Left parties contested 24 seats but managed only a marginal impact on the overall tally.Taken together, the Mahagathbandhan recorded a dramatically lower strike rate, highlighting widespread voter shift away from the coalition.The numbers underline a sweeping approval for the NDA’s campaign strategy and leadership messaging. The BJP’s high success rate across regions, coupled with JD(U)’s durable local networks and the support base of smaller allies, helped the alliance break through caste-driven barriers that traditionally shape Bihar elections.The Mahagathbandhan’s inability to convert its seat-sharing advantage into wins indicates fragmentation in vote transfer, lower mobilisation and erosion of core constituencies.The NDA’s emphatic win reshapes Bihar’s political balance, potentially redefining governance priorities and leadership equations in the coming months. As the alliance prepares to form the next government, the overwhelming mandate also raises questions about power-sharing, especially within the JD(U) – BJP dynamic, which has historically been sensitive to seat tallies.",2025-11-14T17:29:39.511164

Why Voter Adhikar Yatra failed to garner votes for Congress?







The road well walked: Three yatras, one message



The high points: South and the hills



The flat roads: Hindi heartland woes



Walking, talking, but still searching



1,300 kilometres, 25 districts, 110 seats. Rahul Gandhi marched through Bihar echoing “vote chor, gaddi chhod,” but voters clearly took a different route - straight to the polling booth, but away from him.The gamcha, the Bhojpuri, the makhana, the fishing and the bike rides - the Nehru-Gandhi scion threw in every flavour of Bihari charm he could muster. But the performance fell flat. Once again, his attempt to slip into the state’s cultural skin didn’t quite land, and the Congress now finds itself staring at one of its bleakest showings, with the party struggling to even hit double digits.Back in 2020, Congress bagged 19 seats. This time, the slide has only steepened.Despite hammering national narratives, the party’s messaging was drowned out by local realities that it failed to read, let alone ride.The Voter Adhikar Yatra began with strong crowds and genuine enthusiasm, briefly hinting at a revival for the Congress. But as the campaign moved forward, that initial spark faded. The party leaned too heavily on the yatra’s symbolism while offering little sustained presence on the ground.With only scattered appearances from senior leaders, Congress couldn’t maintain momentum or build a deeper connection with voters.This slowdown was worsened by the MGB's internal rifts and muddled coordination. Resentment within the RJD, confused candidate choices, and weak organisational synergy blunted whatever gains the yatra had created. At the same time, shifting local dynamics, such as the BSP’s rise and the NDA’s strategic recalibration, cut further into Congress’s appeal. In the end, local realities overpowered the early hype, leaving the yatra unable to pull voters towards the party.Rahul Gandhi’s three nationwide yatras — Bharat Jodo (2022–23), Bharat Jodo Nyay (2024), and Vote Adhikar (2025) — were crafted to reposition him as a people’s politician. Each march carried a distinct political thesis: the first called for unity against divisive politics, the second championed justice through caste census and welfare, and the third sought to reform electoral practices and mobilize allies under the Mahagathbandhan banner.While the yatras succeeded in transforming Rahul’s image from a detached leader to an engaged campaigner, they also revealed the limits of symbolic politics. They revived enthusiasm among cadres and built narrative energy, but translating that emotional momentum into votes has remained elusive.If the yatras gave Rahul a platform, victories in Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana gave him proof of concept. In Himachal, the Congress’s return to power followed a textbook anti-incumbency swing backed by the Old Pension Scheme. In Karnataka, anti-corruption sentiment and strong local leadership under Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar delivered a resounding 136-seat win. And in Telangana, Revanth Reddy’s aggressive campaign unseated KCR after a decade in power.These wins established Congress as a southern powerhouse and briefly revived its national narrative. The results helped restore morale, re-energize its workers, and suggested that Rahul’s “connect with the people” strategy could still pay dividends — at least in states with strong regional leaders and disciplined organization.Beyond those isolated victories, Congress’s struggles in the Hindi belt continue. Despite a promising 2024 Lok Sabha performance, the 2025 assembly results in Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Delhi exposed deep organizational decay. In Haryana, the Congress came agonizingly close but fell short due to factionalism and lack of a decisive local face. In Maharashtra, alliance fatigue within the MVA cost it dearly. In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, BJP’s disciplined machinery and Modi’s enduring appeal crushed Congress’s hopes. And in Delhi, the party failed yet again to open its account.The only exception was Jharkhand, where the Congress-JMM alliance retained power by focusing on welfare delivery and regional identity politics — proof that Congress still performs best when piggybacking on strong local allies.Rahul Gandhi’s press conferences over the past year, from alleging “vote chori” in Haryana to calling out “hydrogen bomb” voter fraud, have ensured constant media attention. But critics argue that they’ve done little to change electoral outcomes. His messaging resonates with idealists, yet Congress’s electoral machinery remains sluggish, fragmented, and overly dependent on his charisma.Five years, three yatras, and multiple campaigns later, Rahul has successfully crafted a new moral vocabulary for Indian politics — but not yet a winning formula. His journey across India has earned him empathy and visibility, but politics demands more than footprints and soundbites. Unless Congress learns to turn Rahul’s moral momentum into organizational muscle, his yatras may remain grand spectacles of purpose without political payoff.",2025-11-14T17:29:41.184564

Exit polls predicted victory — but not a political earthquake



Axis My India had predicted NDA’s share to land at 121 to 141 seats, expecting the Mahagathbandhan to get anywhere from 98 to 118 seats.

Today’s Chanakya went a little further, offering a bullish 160 (+/–12) for the NDA, with the opposition capped at 77 (+/–13).

Matrize projected 147–167 seats for the ruling alliance while Mahagathbandhan was expected to land at 70-90 seats.

People’s Pulse gave NDA 133–159 seats and 87 to 102 seats for the Mahagathbandhan.

JVC, DVC Research, Polstrat and People’s Insight all held the NDA somewhere between the mid-130s and mid-150s.

Exit polls underestimate NDA wave



NEW DELHI: Bihar’s assembly election results have delivered a sweeping win for the NDA government. The victory itself was no surprise, with exit polls already predicting a clear return to power for the National Democratic Alliance.What truly stood out, however, was not the win but the massive scale of the political shakeup that gave NDA a landslide victory, pushing its tally to a whopping 206 seats, in the 243-member assembly.The final numbers soared well beyond every exit poll estimate, highlighting once again how unpredictable Bihar can be.It also brings back a familiar question: just how accurate are exit polls?A poll of polls offered an averaged estimate of 148 seats, almost 60 seats less than the actual figures for NDA.Across surveys, the NDA’s lead looked strong, but bounded. Even most of the optimistic figures fell short of the whopping 200 mark that the NDA comfortably crossed.Ahead of counting, most agencies were united on one point: the NDA would return to power. But the thing with Bihar is that the exit polls are often proved wrong.Five years ago, in the 2020 elections, almost every exit poll predicted a clear victory for the Mahagathbandhan.But the final result told a very different story as the NDA crossed the majority mark with 125 seats. Meanwhile Mahagathbandhan ran out of green signals after winning 110 seats, an outcome that only a handful of agencies had anticipated.Go back 10 years and the picture gets more complex.In the 2015 elections, Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav fought side by side as a part of the Mahagathbandhan. At the time most of the polls predicted a comfortable 155 seat win for the NDA while Mahagathbandhan was expected to land at just 83.However, the actual results completely reversed the trend, raising questions about the accuracy of the polls. Mahagathbandhan swept the state with 178 seats while NDA candidates won just 58.The 2025 results extend this legacy. Pollsters got the direction right, but the magnitude wildly undermined.",2025-11-14T17:29:47.560867

LJP (RV)'s previous performances

Chirag vs Tejashwi in 2030?

NEW DELHI: The two senior Bihar NDA constituents — the BJP and chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) — may have swept the assembly elections between themselves. But it was Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which brought in the extra seats and powered the coalition’s march beyond the 200-seat mark.Though the counting of votes is still underway and results are still being declared, the LJP (RV) has won or is leading in 19 constituencies. If it wins all those seats, it would end with a strike rate of 68 per cent and would have a won a whopping 1800 per cent more seats than in 2020.The NDA’s decision to allocate 29 constituencies to the LJP (Ram Vilas) had drawn attention — and some unease — within the alliance. The two smaller partners, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and the Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLP), were each given six seats to contest.The LJP (RV) was allotted the following assembly constituencies: Govindganj, Simri Bakhtiarpur, Darauli, Garkha, Sahebpur Kamal, Bakhri, Parbatta, Nathnagar, Paliganj, Brahmapur, Dehri, Balrampur, Makhdumpur, Obra, Sugauli, Belsand, Marhaura, Sherghati, Bodhgaya, Rajauli, Govindpur, Bochha, Bakhtiarpur, Fatuha, Bahadurganj, Mahua, Chenari, Maner and Kasba.However, the party ultimately contested 28 seats, as the nomination of its Marhaura candidate, Seema Singh, was rejected.The LJP (RV) chose not to field a replacement, and the NDA instead extended support to independent candidate Ankit Kumar.The party was established in 2021 following a power tussle between Chirag Paswan and his uncle, Pashupati Kumar Paras, which resulted in the split of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) into two factions. The faction led by Paswan was named the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) in memory of his late father, Ram Vilas Paswan, who passed away in 2020, while the group headed by Paras came to be known as the Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party.Also read: 'Gamcha' in the air: PM Modi leads celebrations after NDA secures sweeping victory in Bihar elections- Watch Formed in 2000 by Ram Vilas Paswan, the original LJP made a strong debut in the February 2005 Bihar assembly elections, winning 29 seats (178 contested) in a contest that produced a fractured verdict. However, its tally dropped to 10 (202 contested) in the re-election held in October the same year. The party’s strength further declined to three seats in 2010 and just two in 2015. In the 2020 assembly polls, despite being an NDA ally, the LJP contested 134 seats independently, winning only one — but inflicting considerable damage on the Janata Dal (United).The success of the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) has vindicated what was once seen as a risky move, firmly consolidating Chirag Paswan’s standing within the NDA. The outcome is likely to further endear the Hajipur MP to the BJP leadership — particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi — whom Paswan has described himself as being “Hanuman” to. The young actor-turned-politician’s rising influence could also set the stage for a future political face-off with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav for Bihar’s chief ministerial post in the 2030 assembly elections.",2025-11-14T17:29:49.334062

‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

NEW DELHI: Bihar assembly election results have left the Congress-led Mahagathbandhan limited to 32 seats, with Congress winning just 6 seats, leading to calls of introspection from within Congress and the opposition parties.Mumtaz Patel, daughter of late Congress veteran Ahmed Patel, said the leadership of the party is concentrated in the hands of a few leaders who are disconnected from the ground. She wrote that loyal workers have stayed with the party through every setback, yet continue to wait for success, and are not given importance.In a post on X, she said, ""The Congress party has such workers across the country who, regardless of victory or defeat, I always say are Congressmen at heart. But no one asks them, no one acknowledges them, and they are not given any position or authority.""Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said the party would study the results seriously and look into organisational issues. He added that he was not invited to campaign in Bihar, but stressed that the RJD, as the senior partner, must also examine its performance.Former state chief Akhilesh Prasad Singh echoed the need for introspection and said there should not have been “friendly fights” within the alliance.Other opposition voices also reacted to the defeat. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi asked opposition parties to speak more directly to women voters, saying an alternative vision cannot be built without them.The Congress party, which won 19 seats in the 2020 election, has fallen to just 6 seats this time. Despite raising allegations of “voter chori” against the Centre and the Election Commission, and campaigning through the Special Intensive Revision drive and the Voter Adhikar Yatra, the Congress failed to build real momentum on the ground.",2025-11-14T17:29:51.002673

Top quotes from PM Modi's speech:



Jai Chhathi Maiya, yeh prachand jeet, atoot vishwas, Bihar ke logo ne bilkul garda uda diya hai.

Some parties in Bihar had created the appeasement formula of MY. But today's victory has given a new positive MY formula, and that is Mahila and Youth. Today, Bihar is among those states of the country which have the highest number of youth, and this includes youth from every religion and every caste. Their desire, their aspiration and their dreams have completely destroyed the old communal MY formula of the Jungle Raj people.

This election has further strengthened the public's trust in the Election Commission of India. The consistently high voter turnout over the past few years, the increased turnout by the deprived and the exploited, is a significant achievement for the Election Commission.

Today, the Congress has become MMC- Muslim League Maoist Congress and the entire agenda of the Congress now revolves around this, and therefore, within the Congress as well, a separate faction is emerging that is uncomfortable with this negative politics...I fear that there could be another major split in the Congress.

Ganga flows through Bihar and reaches Bengal. Bihar has also paved the way for the BJP's victory in Bengal. I also congratulate the brothers and sisters of Bengal. Now, together with you, the BJP will uproot jungle raj from West Bengal as well.

This is the same Bihar that was once dominated by Maoist terror. Voting used to end at 3 pm in Naxal-affected areas. But in this election, people in Bihar have voted without fear, with enthusiasm and excitement. You also know what used to happen in Bihar during the times of jungle raj. Violence used to occur openly at polling stations. Ballot boxes were looted. Today, the same Bihar is seeing record voter turnout. It is voting peacefully. Everyone's vote has been recorded. Everyone has cast their vote as per their choice.

We are the servants of the people. We keep making the people happy with our hard work and we have stolen the hearts of the people. And that is why the entire Bihar has said 'Phir ek baar NDA Sarkar'.

When I used to speak about Jungle Raj and Katta Sarkar in Bihar elections, the RJD party raised no objections. But it hurt the people of Congress. Today, I want to reiterate that Katta Sarkar will never return to Bihar...The people of Bihar have voted for Viksit Bihar.

Our government is striving to include Chhath in the Unesco heritage list. The goal is to connect the entire country and the world with this culture through its significance.

NEW DELHI: ""Bihar ke logon ne garda uda diya,"" declared Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his first address after National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured a historic win in Bihar Assembly Elections on Friday. Hailing ""Chhathi Maiyya"", he extended his gratitude to the voters for ""rejecting appeasement politics of the opposition"".Highlighting the high voter turnout in the state, especially that of women, PM Modi said that the people had given a new ""positive MY formula, and that is Mahila and youth"".Referring to the opposition to the Special Intensive Revision in Bihar and ""vote chori"" allegations, PM Modi said that the high voter turnout had ""further strengthened the public's trust in the Election Commission of India"".NDA emerged victorious in the state comfortably crossing 200 seat mark.Hailing the victory, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar extended his gratitude to PM Modi along with the voters.""In the Bihar Legislative Assembly Election-2025, the people of the state have given us a thumping majority, expressing their confidence in our government. For this, I offer my salutations to all the esteemed voters of the state, heartfelt thanks, and gratitude,"" he said in a post on X.""I extend my salutations to the esteemed Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji, along with heartfelt thanks and gratitude for the support received from him. The NDA alliance has demonstrated complete unity in this election and secured a thumping majority. For this resounding victory, I also express thanks and gratitude to all our N.D.A. alliance partners—Shri Chirag Paswan Ji, Shri Jitan Ram Manjhi Ji, and Shri Upendra Kushwaha Ji. With everyone's support, Bihar will advance even further and join the ranks of the most developed states in the country,"" he added.",2025-11-14T17:29:52.761220

‘Not Just Congress’: Tharoor Calls Out RJD Amid NDA’s Big Bihar Lead

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav defeated BJP’s Satish Kumar by 14,532 votes from his family bastion Raghopur assembly constituency, which faced a tense battle marked by repeated swings in lead and trails.Tejashwi was trailing by nearly 5,000 votes until the 16th round of voting before bouncing back to maintain a strong lead against Satish Kumar.Raghopur, a key assembly seat in Bihar’s Vaishali district, has long been the citadel of the Lalu Prasad Yadav family and the Rashtriya Janata Dal. The constituency is dominated by the Yadav community, which accounts for nearly 1.25 lakh voters, far outnumbering Rajputs, Scheduled Castes and other OBC groups.This demographic advantage has traditionally ensured a steady flow of support for the RJD and the Lalu family.The hold has been formidable. Lalu Prasad Yadav, former chief minister Rabri Devi and their son Tejashwi Yadav have together won the seat seven times. Tejashwi secured Raghopur comfortably in both 2015 and 2020, reinforcing the family’s deep political roots in the region.The Yadav-heavy caste structure once guaranteed the RJD a near-automatic advantage.This time, a mix of local dissatisfaction, the BJP’s aggressive outreach to Yadav voters and possible anti-incumbency currents, however, failed to dent that comfort zone.Raghopur's political profile has always revolved around the dominance of Yadav voters and their alignment with the Lalu family.Though Tejashwi won the Raghopur battle, his party faced an embarrassing defeat in the Bihar election as the entire Mahagathbandhan could barely manage to win over 34 seats in the 243-seat Bihar assembly.",2025-11-14T17:29:56.089395

The XX-chromosome factor



MP, Maha, Delhi: Lessons from history



In Bihar’s political theatre, irony has always been the opening act, and Nitish Kumar, the master of reinvention, once again turned contradiction into victory.With the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) sweeping the assembly elections by surging past the half-way mark, one wonders what could have been the X-factor that made the people of one of the poorest states vote in favour of the incumbent government.Not long ago, Kumar had mocked the politics of freebies, declaring that “electricity will not be given for free” — a thinly veiled jibe at Arvind Kejriwal’s Delhi model. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, had warned against the “revadi culture,” accusing rival parties of trying to “buy out people” with giveaways instead of building lasting infrastructure. Yet, a year later, the same duo leaned on what they once derided.From tablets for Vikas Mitras to cash allowances for unemployed youth, the NDA’s campaign brimmed with giveaways. Nitish Kumar, once the critic of populism, turned practitioner, rolling out sops for women, students, and workers, blurring the line between welfare and wooing. The alliance that once swore by roads and railways now found its rhythm in revadis.Also read: Bihar election results 2025: 5 reasons behind NDA's historic win In the run-up to the Bihar polls, the chief minister doubled down with a cascade of cash allowances, gadgets, and welfare sops: unemployment benefits for the youth, tablet grants for Vikas Mitras, smartphones for educators, and enhanced pensions for the elderly and widows.The NDA’s campaign, once anchored in governance and growth, found itself powered by the very handouts its leaders had once scorned.Ironically, the strategy worked. As the results rolled in, the NDA’s mix of welfare and wooing delivered a decisive win, especially among women and first-time voters. The same “revadis” once dismissed as dangerous to democracy had turned into the secret sauce of Nitish Kumar’s survival — proof that in Indian politics, even the fiercest critics of freebies eventually learn to serve them sweet.In Bihar, the NDA’s women-centric schemes emerged as the X-factor in its electoral strategy, mirroring the impact of similar programs in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, offering seed funding and follow-up support for women entrepreneurs, gave the coalition a tangible connection with a crucial voter base. Just as the Ladli Behna scheme in MP and the Majhi Ladki Bahin program in Maharashtra boosted turnout and loyalty among female voters, Bihar’s initiative strengthened the NDA’s appeal in rural and semi-urban areas.Beyond women’s schemes, the coalition combined broad welfare measures with targeted grassroots support. Free electricity for the first 125 units, tablet and smartphone grants for Vikas Mitras and Shiksha Sevaks, and increased pensions for senior citizens and the disabled created a multi-layered support network across communities. These measures ensured that both household-level and institutional influencers felt directly invested in the government’s success.Frontline and working-class groups were also courted through clothing allowances for construction workers and raised honorariums for ASHA, Anganwadi, and Jeevika workers. Together with the promise of one crore jobs over five years, these interventions built a narrative of inclusive welfare and governance—helping the NDA replicate the formula of women-driven, benefit-backed victories seen in MP and Maharashtra.Across states, the BJP and its allies rode to victory on the strength of aggressive, women-focused welfare schemes. In Madhya Pradesh, the Ladli Behna Yojana became the centerpiece of the campaign, offering monthly cash support that was later promised to rise to ₹3,000. The scheme’s wide reach and direct financial appeal turned women voters into a decisive bloc, helping the BJP secure a clear edge over the Congress.Maharashtra saw a similar pattern. The Mahayuti alliance’s Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana reshaped the electoral map, with beneficiary-heavy districts delivering some of the coalition’s strongest results. A marked rise in women’s turnout underscored how deeply these cash transfers influenced voting behaviour, particularly in regions facing economic strain.Even in Delhi, the election became a contest of competing welfare promises. While all parties offered free electricity, water, transport and financial aid, the BJP ultimately benefited from a perception that welfare needed to be backed by credible governance. Taken together, these results show a clear trend: targeted freebies—especially for women—didn’t just shape the narrative, they shaped the outcome.",2025-11-14T17:29:57.779890

The shadow of '

jungle raj

'

'Jab tak samose mein aalu rahega ... '

Tejashwi benefits & suffers at the same time

Rejected & revered, yet always relevant

NEW DELHI: Lalu Prasad Yadav was not on the ballot in the 2025 Bihar elections. His health is fragile, his legal battles continue and under his son Tejashwi Yadav 's leadership, their party RJD delivered one of its worst performances and was leading in just 25 seats.Lalu was far away from rallies and campaigns, yet across Bihar's political battleground, one truth remains unchanged: Lalu remains relevant even today in the state politics.Lalu’s tenure as chief minister in the 1990s continues to define Bihar’s electoral narrative. For critics, especially within the NDA, that era remains shorthand for jungle raj — a period associated with lawlessness, gang violence and administrative collapse.Throughout 2025 election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar repeatedly invoked Lalu's ""misrule"", warning voters that a Mahagathbandhan government would drag Bihar back into those ""dark days.""But the shadow of jungle raj is not just rhetorical, it is rooted in a period between 1990 and 2005 that many still describe as Bihar's darkest phase. Kidnappings, extortion, and caste-based violence surged.Governance eroded, infrastructure crumbled, and the state’s economy stagnated. The infamous fodder scam further cemented Lalu’s reputation for systemic corruption and misuse of power.For a large section of voters, especially the young and aspirational, this legacy remains an indelible cautionary tale.Yet for millions among the backward castes, Dalits and minorities, the same era symbolises dignity and representation. Lalu’s supporters maintain that he broke the dominance of the traditional elite and spoke for the marginalised in a way no leader had before.Few political slogans have captured Bihar’s emotions like the iconic line: ""Jab tak rahega samose mein aalu, tab tak rahega Bihar mein Lalu.” It compares the potato in a samosa, indispensable and familiar, to Lalu's unshakeable political relevance.Even in 2025, the slogan appears at rallies, on posters, memes, and WhatsApp forwards, underscoring that Lalu is not just a politician, he is a cultural presence.Tejashwi Yadav found himself at the power centre of an already well-established party, courtesy his father Lalu Yadav. His political pitch leans heavily on his father’s legacy of social justice and backward caste empowerment and the familiar Muslim-Yadav vote bank.But Tejashwi also bears the burden of Lalu’s past.Despite his attempts to project a governance-focused message, he struggled to shake off the negative connotations of jungle raj. Many voters were unsure whether he represented a break from chaos or a continuation of old patterns. This ambiguity diluted his appeal, especially among voters seeking stability and development.The NDA exploited this effectively, framing the Mahagathbandhan as a return to disorder and misgovernance. Their messaging resonated deeply with upper castes and governance focused voters who fear a repeat of the 1990s.Internal friction within the RJD further complicated Tejashwi’s task. His elder brother Tej Pratap’s separate political front risked splintering the Yadav vote, while factionalism within allied parties weakened the perception of a disciplined, ready-to-govern alternative.What makes Lalu’s relevance extraordinary is that both alliances need him: RJD invokes him to consolidate backward caste and minority votes; NDA invokes him to warn voters against the return of lawlessness.This election once again proved that Lalu remains the pivot of Bihar politics, even in physical and political absence.The verdict of Bihar elections 2025 - Lalu still defines Bihar’s political vocabulary.This election proves a paradox: Lalu Prasad Yadav did not contest, he did not campaign, he barely appeared in public.And yet, no election speech was complete without his name, no NDA rally avoided invoking his legacy (even if in negative context) and no MGB strategy could ignore his symbolism.Loved by some, feared by others, but ignored by none, Lalu still remains central to Bihar’s political theatre.",2025-11-14T17:29:59.506478

This is expected to support exporters contending with elongated order and payment cycles.Exporters who availed packing credit on or before August 31, 2025, but could not dispatch goods, may now liquidate these facilities through legitimate alternative means. These include domestic sales or proceeds from substitute export contracts — a flexibility meant to prevent working-capital stress from stalled shipments.",2025-11-14T17:30:06.533765

India has asked Russia to fast-track approvals for Indian exporters --including expedited listing of domestic establishments and quicker registration of marine and pharmaceutical products -- as part of a broader push to expand two-way trade, the commerce ministry said on Thursday.Commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal, currently in Moscow, stressed the need for “confidence-building measures to unlock market access” during discussions with Russian officials at the 26th Meeting of the India-Russia Working Group on Trade and Economic Cooperation, reported ET.“The issues included expedited listing of Indian establishments and a systems-based approach with FSVPS in agriculture, especially marine products and a time-bound pathway in pharmaceuticals covering registration, regulatory reliance and predictable timelines,” the official statement said, quoted ET.FSVPS is Russia’s Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Supervision.Agrawal and Russian deputy minister of economic development Vladimir Ilyichev finalised and signed a forward-looking protocol covering multiple sectors aimed at strengthening economic ties. Bilateral trade currently stands at $25 billion, with both sides committed to raising it to $100 billion by 2030.The working group identified opportunities across engineering goods, chemicals and plastics, electronics, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, leather and textiles.It also mapped areas where Indian strengths --including smartphones, motor vehicles, gems and jewellery, organic chemicals, textiles and leather -- can support Russia’s trade diversification and de-risking strategy.In services, India encouraged Russian entities to increase procurement of Indian IT-BPM, healthcare, education and creative services. It also pushed for predictable mobility for Indian professionals amid growing labour shortages in Russia.India highlighted its global capability centre (GCC) ecosystem -- over 1,700 centres employing nearly 1.9 million professionals -- as a ready platform for Russian firms to enhance business continuity, cybersecurity, design, analytics and shared-services support, bolstering supply-chain resilience.The Indian side acknowledged Russia’s interest in concluding a bilateral investment treaty.

India has slipped into the “reverse AI trade” category within emerging markets after an unusually weak year, even as strong domestic inflows prevented a sharper slide, ET reported, citing Chris Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies.In his Greed & Fear note, Wood pointed out that India has lagged the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 27 percentage points so far in 2025 — the steepest underperformance among major EMs — while the rupee has eased 3.4% to Rs 88.7 against the dollar. The contrast, he said, stems from the dominance of AI-driven valuation surges in Taiwan, Korea and China, which together represent 61.8% of the EM index, compared with India’s 15.3% weight.“India has become the reverse AI trade,” Wood wrote, arguing that any correction in AI-heavy markets would likely favour India, “which is another way of saying it should outperform if the AI trade suddenly unwinds.”Wood warned that constraints on power availability are beginning to curb the pace of global AI expansion, despite colossal investment plans by US hyperscalers: $360–370 billion in capex expected in 2025 and around $470 billion in 2026.He cited comments from Satya Nadella, Andy Jassy and Jensen Huang, with Huang cautioning that “China is going to win the AI race” because it has access to cheaper energy.India may be the worst EM performer on a relative basis, but it avoided a full-blown selloff because local investors have continued to buy aggressively:Foreign investors, meanwhile, have withdrawn $16.2 billion this year — near record levels — yet markets avoided the kind of heavy correction typically associated with such outflows.Wood and Mahesh Nandurkar, Jefferies’ India research head, said several macro indicators suggest the rupee has likely stabilised near the 89 mark. They expect monetary easing, credit growth and the GST rate reductions effective September 22 to lift activity and nominal GDP in coming quarters.The AI shift has hit Indian IT services the hardest:Wood noted that while IT services have cooled, India-based global capability centres (GCCs) are becoming more central to India’s services export engine. GCC-related exports within the $388 billion services basket gained prominence last fiscal year.Indian real estate developers were flagged as “positively attractive” by Wood, as many are trading below long-term valuation benchmarks. Pre-sales for seven listed players are projected to rise 22% in FY26, while net debt across these companies has dropped sharply from Rs 520 billion in FY19 to a projected Rs 28 billion by FY26-end.Wood flagged state-level populism — especially in election-bound Bihar — as a major risk for the rupee and bond markets. Bihar’s parties promised cash transfers of Rs 10,000–30,000 to women under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana.Even with the Centre’s deficit expected at 4.4% of GDP, the combined Centre–state gap remains elevated at 7.5%. Bihar, with a per-capita GDP of Rs 69,321 and a population of 131 million, was cited as a stress test for fiscal discipline.Despite the year’s drawdown, Wood argued India’s structural story remains compelling — and could become more attractive if the AI rally in North Asia cools.",2025-11-14T17:30:10.414341

An ET analysis of HSBC and S&P Global Market Intelligence data shows that the jobs component of the seasonally adjusted HSBC India PMI rose to 53.8 during January–October 2025, up from 52.5 in the same period last year.Executives at large conglomerates including Vedanta Group and RPG, along with senior economists, affirmed that the hiring environment has strengthened. Lower GST rates, easing inflation and softer interest rates have lifted consumer activity across sectors, prompting companies to expand their workforce.KEC International, part of RPG, said its hiring has been closely aligned with its growth trajectory. “We have seen stronger hiring momentum through 2025. Between January and September, our recruitment has remained robust,” said Vimal Kejriwal, MD & CEO, KEC International. “Our overall workforce has grown by around 13% compared to last year’s H1.” The company added more than 1,500 professionals in the first half of FY26.Economists said the improvement is driven largely by larger enterprises. “Hiring is taking place at larger companies, which is a positive sign and hopefully this can be retained,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda.Vedanta said its own recruitment has risen 15–18% from last year. “Vedanta’s hiring momentum continues to rise in tandem with our business growth, driven by large-scale project execution and new investments across our aluminium, zinc, silver, and copper verticals,” a spokesperson said, adding that the company is strengthening talent pipelines as it expands across new sectors.Sector-wise PMI data shows a similar trend. Within manufacturing, the employment index reached 53.8 this year compared with 52.4 in 2024, while services rose to 53.8 from 52.5. “The strength of job creation...reflects robust sales performances, planning ahead of anticipated demand growth and efforts to ensure sufficient capacity,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director, S&P Global Market Intelligence.Official indicators also reflect the pick-up. The labour force participation rate (LFPR) rose to a five-month high of 55.3% in September from 55% in August.Economists expect momentum to continue as tax cuts and healthy consumption trends filter through. “With GST and income tax cuts, urban demand will pick up, leading to positive improvement in employment,” said Gaura Sengupta, chief economist, IDFC First Bank.KEC said the outlook remains strong, supported by a healthy order book, infrastructure spending and traction in the Middle East. Vedanta attributed its hiring gains to diversification into green energy and digital technology, greater local sourcing that drives indirect jobs, AI-led recruitment efficiencies and an expanded talent pool including global experts and advanced manufacturing specialists.",2025-11-14T17:30:13.747297

India’s move to scrap Quality Control Orders (QCOs) on a wide basket of raw materials across textiles, plastics and mining has brought immediate relief to manufacturers, even as the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has urged the government to keep a tight watch on possible import surges, ANI reported.The withdrawal, notified on November 13, eliminates mandatory BIS certification for 14 products under the Chemicals & Petrochemicals Ministry and six under the Mines Ministry. The list includes widely used inputs such as PTA, MEG, polyester fibres, polypropylene, polyethylene, PVC resin, ABS, polycarbonate, and metals such as aluminium, lead, nickel, tin and zinc.The reforms flow from the Gauba Committee’s findings, which noted that QCOs grew from fewer than 70 a decade ago to nearly 790, many covering raw materials without direct safety implications.Industry groups had long argued that mandatory certification on industrial inputs created delays, raised costs and often did not enhance product quality.According to GTRI, the rollback will immediately ease sourcing pressures in textile hubs like Surat, Ludhiana, Tiruppur and Bhilwara, and among plastics processors, nearly 90% of whom are MSMEs. Earlier requirements led to long queues at BIS labs, port detentions and demurrage charges, frequently crippling small units.Exporters are also expected to benefit as easier access to globally certified intermediates improves competitiveness in technical textiles, moulded plastics, engineering goods and synthetic garments.The withdrawal of QCOs for metals such as aluminium, zinc, lead, nickel and tin restores supply flexibility for downstream sectors including auto components, electronics, batteries, construction and defence. India has no primary nickel production, and limited domestic output in several specialised grades, meaning the earlier regime risked choking critical imports.That relief, however, comes with a caution. GTRI says MSMEs are now looking for similar reforms in steel, where QCOs continue to distort availability and pricing. In stainless-steel flats, for example, domestic capacity remains inadequate, while foreign suppliers stay away from BIS certification due to cost and scale constraints. Other product lines — including fasteners, auto hinges and telescopic channels — face comparable bottlenecks, with small manufacturers alleging that current rules favour a handful of large players.GTRI also flags the need for “daily monitoring” of import trends to prevent the absence of QCOs from becoming an opportunity for dumping low-grade or excess stocks into India. If injury is detected, policymakers may need to rely on anti-dumping duties, safeguard actions or tariff-rate measures to protect domestic producers.The think-tank added that while the government’s decision marks a major, globally aligned shift — removing QCOs where they add friction rather than safety — strong surveillance architecture will be essential to ensure MSMEs remain shielded and competition stays fair.",2025-11-14T17:30:15.474001

Andhra Pradesh is set to see another major AI boost, months after Google announced its AI data centre investment. This time, Reliance Industries has announced setting up a 1 GW AI-focused data centre in the south Indian state. The upcoming Reliance facility will be built as a modular unit equipped with graphic processing units, tensor processing units and other AI processors, according to ET. It is being designed as a counterpart to the company’s data centre in Jamnagar.Andhra Pradesh has been working to position itself as a large data centre hub, and had recently signed an agreement with Google. In an earlier conversation with ET, state IT and electronics minister Nara Lokesh had said the government is aiming for a total of 6 GW in data centre capacity.So far, Andhra Pradesh has closed deals for 1 GW with Google and 500 MW with Sify. The addition of Reliance Industries’ proposal moves the state closer to its target. Sources told the agency that the company also plans to set up a 6 GW solar power project to supply energy for the new data centre.Reliance Industries executive director PMS Prasad is scheduled to sign an MoU with chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday. The agreement will also include the company’s greenfield integrated food park planned at Kurnool across 170 acres.The park will manufacture beverages, packaged drinking water, chocolates, snacks and atta, a plan Naidu reaffirmed in an interview to ET, earlier.The announcements coincide with the CII Partnership Summit being held in the state, during which the government expects to formalise over 400 MoUs with major companies. These include proposed investments from Brookfield (Rs 1.08 lakh crore), ReNew (Rs 82,000 crore), SAEL Industries (Rs 22,000 crore) and Hero Future Energies (Rs 15,000 crore), to be signed across Friday and Saturday.Responding to concerns about agreements not materialising into real projects, Naidu said, “These MoUs are not on paper. Each investment is genuine and will come into the state within the next three and a half to four years.”He added, “I am happy to share that over the last 16 months, my cabinet has cleared investments of up to Rs 9 lakh crore. Over the next two days, we will be signing MoUs for another Rs 9-10 lakh crore. These are all implementable. We will be able to get Rs 20 lakh crore of investments grounded and generate 20 lakh jobs.”",2025-11-14T17:30:17.183806

Large public issues, usually known for testing investor appetite, have emerged as the standout theme of India’s 2025 primary market. Contrary to earlier cycles where big IPOs struggled to draw heavy bids, this year has seen large issues attract some of their strongest-ever subscriptions, supported by abundant institutional liquidity and sharper investor selectivity.According to an ET report, IPOs valued above Rs 5,000 crore have averaged 17.7 times subscription so far this year — the highest since 2021 and far beyond the usual 8–10 times range seen in earlier bull cycles. Four of the six large issues launched in 2025 turned into clear blockbusters: LG Electronics India (38.17 times), Lenskart Solutions (28.35 times), and HDB Financial Services and Groww (17.6 times each). Hexaware Technologies (2.27 times) and Tata Capital (1.96 times) saw more moderate interest.Market watchers attribute the shift to broad-based institutional demand. “Nearly 75–80% of subscriptions are coming from institutions,” said Arun Kejriwal of Kejriwal Research, ET quoted. He added that corporate treasuries and bank treasuries have also been active bidders, often exiting on the day of listing.One big factor boosting appetite is price visibility. Several large 2025 issuers — including Tata Capital and HDB Financial Services — had long been active in the unlisted market.The gap between their grey-market pricing and IPO valuations created short-term arbitrage opportunities for investors, prompting aggressive bidding in the primary market.Collectively, these six IPOs have mobilised around Rs 62,000 crore this year. Overall, 84 IPOs have raised Rs 1.29 lakh crore in 2025 so far, as per ETIG data.Merchant bankers say the surge underscores a maturing investor mindset. “Risk appetite hasn’t reduced — it has become more intelligent,” said Amit Ramchandani, MD & CEO, Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors. “In 2025, investors are rewarding scale, profitability and brand-led growth, not just narratives. What’s striking is that even large issues are seeing strong institutional and HNI participation.”The contrast with earlier years is sharp. In 2021, excluding Nykaa’s 81-times subscription, several big issues such as Paytm and Sona BLW struggled to cross the 2-times mark. LIC in 2022 drew just 2.65 times interest, while Delhivery was subscribed 1.33 times. There were no mega issues in 2023, and in 2024 the bull market helped Bajaj Housing Finance (49.97 times) and Vishal Mega Mart (20.47 times) draw heavy demand.The 2025 market, analysts say, shows a decisive shift toward category leaders and disruptive business models. “Investors don’t want to back me-too companies unless they are clear leaders,” said Bhavesh Shah of Equirus Capital. While institutional investors continue to dominate allocations, retail participation has also become more consistent and discerning.Industry experts agree that the current IPO cycle is, above all, a reflection of the broader equity market mood. “The IPO market is always a function of a bull market,” said Siddarth Bhamre of Asit C Mehta. “When valuations are rich, liquidity moves to the primary market — and subscription numbers rise as more participants chase allocation.”",2025-11-14T17:30:18.847223

China’s consumer spending lost further momentum in October, with official figures showing the weakest pace of retail growth in more than a year.The numbers, released on Friday highlight the difficulty authorities are facing as they try to lift confidence among households still reluctant to spend.According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), retail sales were up 2.9% year-on-year last month, easing from the 3% rise recorded in September. The performance marked the slowest expansion since August of the previous year and extended a five-month pattern of moderating growth from the 6.4% high reached in May.At a briefing in Beijing, NBS chief economist Fu Linghui acknowledged the strain on the broader economy.“External instability and uncertainty factors remain numerous, domestic structural adjustment pressures are significant, and the stable operation of the economy faces many challenges,"" he told AFP.China has struggled with muted domestic demand since the end of Covid restrictions, while long-running stress in the property market continues to weigh on households. Economists have argued that a shift towards consumption-driven growth will be essential, as infrastructure investment and exports, once the main engines, offer less support.Even so, officials are pressing ahead with a five percent growth target for 2025, which analysts still consider achievable.October’s spending slowdown coincided with efforts by Beijing and Washington to ease their trade dispute. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping reached a one-year truce in October aimed at reducing the damage from the long-running trade war. China’s exports have held up through most of the year despite U.S. tariffs, helped by stronger shipments to markets such as Southeast Asia. However, reviving activity at home has been considerably harder.Last month’s Communist Party meeting on economic planning placed emphasis on boosting demand, with leaders calling for the country to “vigorously boost consumption”. A report issued this week by Moody’s Ratings warned that China’s “domestic demand may be slow to revive”, adding that new priorities include “accelerating innovation in strategic technologies and reinforcing domestic demand through structural improvements in income distribution and social safety nets”.Factory output also missed expectations. Industrial production rose 4.9% in October compared with a year earlier, below Bloomberg’s 5.5% forecast and the slowest increase since August of last year.“A key drag came from weaker external demand -- export values and industrial sales for export both weakened significantly,” said Zichun Huang of Capital Economics in a note on the latest data.She further told AFP that “the economy [is expected] to remain weak over the coming quarter” and said the trade truce with Washington “is unlikely to provide much relief”.The country’s housing market continued to deteriorate. New home prices fell year-on-year in 61 of the 70 major cities tracked by the NBS in October, reflecting the ongoing impact of a debt crisis that has gripped the sector since 2020. “The housing sector still clouds the overall outlook,” wrote Sheana Yue, Senior Economist at Oxford Economics.Investment figures also pointed to softening conditions. Fixed-asset investment declined 1.7% in the January–October period from a year earlier, following a 0.5% drop in September when the measure first turned negative.",2025-11-14T17:30:20.484788

The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) had inched up 0.13% in September and stood at 2.75% a year earlier.The industry ministry said October’s negative print was driven by lower prices of food articles, crude petroleum and natural gas, electricity, mineral oils and basic metals, PTI reported. Food inflation saw the steepest fall, with overall deflation widening to 8.31% from 5.22% in September. Prices of vegetables, pulses and key staples dropped sharply, led by onion and potato.Vegetable prices fell 34.97% in October compared with 24.41% in September, while pulses saw deflation of 16.50%. Potato prices slid 39.88% and onion prices recorded a sharp 65.43% decline.Manufactured product inflation eased to 1.54% from 2.33% in the previous month, while fuel and power remained in deflation for the seventh consecutive month at (-)2.55%, marginally lower than September’s (-)2.58%.Analysts expect wholesale prices to remain subdued for the next few months due to a favourable base and the impact of tax cuts.“A favourable base effect in the rest of FY26 is expected to keep the wholesale index in deflation. We anticipate WPI deflation in November to be under 1%,” said Paras Jasrai, Associate Director at India Ratings and Research.The slide in wholesale inflation comes soon after the September 22 reduction in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates, which brought the four-tier tax structure down to two slabs — 5% and 18% — for several mass-consumption goods. The rate cuts have fed into lower retail and wholesale prices.Retail inflation data released last week showed consumer price index (CPI) inflation dropping to a historic low of 0.25% in October, compared with 1.44% in September, helped by GST rationalisation and a high base effect.The Reserve Bank of India held its policy rate steady at 5.5% in its last review. With both WPI and CPI declining sharply, expectations have risen that the Monetary Policy Committee may consider reducing the repo rate in the December 3–5 meeting.Jasrai noted that while domestic growth trends do not strongly justify monetary easing, the central bank may still opt for a 25–50 basis point rate cut to prevent prolonged economic sluggishness.

Benchmark indices ended their two-week losing streak and are trading firmly higher this week, in line with gains across global markets. Investor confidence has strengthened as the US government shutdown came to an end, with growing expectations of early Federal Reserve rate cuts amid signs of a slowdown in the U.S. job market. Additionally, India’s CPI data came in at a record low, while exit polls from the Bihar election indicating a majority for the ruling NDA further lifted sentiment. Hopes of an India–US trade deal also added to the positive momentum.Market trajectory in the upcoming week is likely to be driven by the outcome of the Bihar election, scheduled for release tomorrow, and key developments surrounding the anticipated India–U.S. trade agreement. Both factors are expected to act as major sentiment catalysts and could trigger heightened volatility across broader indices.Going forward, the broader market structure remains constructive, and we maintain a bullish bias.We recommend utilizing any corrective declines as accumulation opportunities for the next leg of the uptrend, with upside targets placed at 26,100, followed by a potential retest of the all-time high near the 26,277 zone in the coming weeks.In line with expectations, buying demand during last week emerged from the support area of 25,500-25,300. We expect the index to hold above the same being the confluence of the following technical observations.Among the oscillators, the daily 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal thus supports the overall positive bias in the index.Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the range of 57200-58600 for the fourth week in a row and is currently placed around the upper band of the range.Going ahead we expect the index to break above the upper band of the consolidation range and head towards 59,000 and 59,800 levels in the coming weeks being the measuring implication of the last 4 weeks range.On the downside, the lower band of the consolidation range at 57,300–57,100, which coincides with the recent breakout zone and the 20-day EMA, is likely to act as a strong support area.Among the oscillators, the daily 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal thus supports the overall positive bias in the index.CG Power is highly optimistic, driven by structural industry tailwinds (T&D capex, railway modernization, Make in India), aggressive capacity expansion, and a strategic push into semiconductors and services. Company benefits from a diverse customer base, a strong manufacturing foundation, continuous R&D and product development, and rising export opportunities.The company faces challenges from the cyclical nature of the power business, increasing transformer supply in India, and its lack of prior experience in semiconductors. We have valued the company using the P/E valuation method, applying a 57x multiple on FY28E earnings, arriving at a target price of Rs 798.The stock is forming base around the 80% retracement of the previous major up move of October 2025 and has witnessed a shallow retracement of its previous up move signaling overall positive bias in the stock.We expect the stock to resume up move and head towards 7980 levels in the coming month being the confluence of the previous major high and key retracement of the current decline.Among the oscillators the daily stochastic has approached oversold territory and is seen rebounding from the same thus signals pullback in the coming months.",2025-11-14T17:30:36.294935

NEW DELHI: Vaibhav Suryavanshi’s 42-ball 144, studded with a jaw-dropping 15 sixes, lit up the ACC Men’s Asia Cup Rising Stars 2025 as India A bulldozed their way to 297/4 against UAE at the West End Park International Cricket Stadium in Doha on Friday. Suryavanshi scored a century in just 32 balls.What unfolded was a stunning exhibition of brute force, clean hitting and fearless strokeplay, leaving the UAE bowlers shell-shocked and the crowd in disbelief.Sent in to bat, India A were off to a brisk start despite losing Priyansh Arya early for 10 off 6 balls.But what followed was absolute carnage.Suryavanshi walked in with quiet intent but unleashed chaos within minutes.Every over seemed to bring a new flurry of sixes as he targeted every bowler with ruthless precision.His 42-ball 144, packed with 11 fours and 15 towering sixes, came at a scarcely believable strike rate of 342.86.The highlight of his innings was the 163-run partnership off just 57 balls with Naman Dhir (34 off 23), which shifted the momentum completely in India A’s favour.UAE's bowlers looked helpless as Suryavanshi cleared the boundaries at will, with even mishits travelling over the ropes.His dismissal at 195/3 in 12.3 overs finally brought some relief for the UAE side, but the damage was already irreparable.However, India A were far from done. Captain and wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma took over the assault, smashing an unbeaten 83 off just 32 balls.His knock, featuring eight fours and six sixes, ensured that the scoring rate never dipped.Jitesh was clinical with his placements and devastating with his power, stitching crucial stands first with Nehal Wadhera (14 off 9) and later with Ramandeep Singh (6* off 8), adding 65 runs off just 28 balls for the unbroken fifth wicket.UAE’s bowling figures bore a brutal look. Muhammad Farazuddin (1/64), Aayan Afzal Khan (1/42) and Muhammad Arfan (1/57) were the only wicket-takers, but none could contain the fury unleashed by India A’s top order.Jawadullah conceded 64 runs in his four overs, while Harshit Kaushik’s lone over went for 30, epitomizing UAE’s nightmare with the ball.",2025-11-14T17:30:38.257040

Shubman Gill Press Conference: Team India captain opens up about India’s bowling plan for SA Test

NEW DELHI: Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah ’s impressive opening-day spell in the first Test against South Africa at Eden Gardens was overshadowed by a controversial on-field exchange involving South African captain Temba Bavuma that quickly went viral on social media.Bumrah had already removed openers Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton when he believed he had trapped Bavuma leg-before.The on-field umpire turned down the appeal, prompting a discussion between Bumrah and wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant over whether to opt for the Decision Review System (DRS).During the chat, either Bumrah or Pant was allegedly heard referring to Bavuma as “bauna” (short or dwarf), a remark that triggered widespread attention and debate online.The moment in question came after Bumrah struck Bavuma on the pads.While Bumrah pushed for a review, Pant advised against it, predicting the ball would sail over the leg stump regardless of Bavuma’s height.Replays later validated Pant’s judgement, showing the delivery missing the stumps by a narrow margin.Bavuma’s stay at the crease was brief; he was dismissed by spinner Kuldeep Yadav after just 11 balls.Watch the video here Earlier, South Africa won the toss and opted to bat. India made notable selection calls, leaving out Sai Sudharsan and including both Dhruv Jurel and Rishabh Pant in the XI. The team management also went with an unconventional bowling setup, fielding four spinners, while entrusting Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj with the pace duties.Despite a strong bowling effort from Bumrah, the on-field remark dominated discussions on Day 1.",2025-11-14T17:30:41.493885

NEW DELHI: Fourteen-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi produced a breathtaking display of power-hitting, smashing a 32-ball century in the Rising Stars Asia Cup clash against the UAE at the West End Park International Cricket Stadium in Doha. His whirlwind knock not only stunned the opposition but also etched his name among India’s fastest century-makers in T20 cricket history.Suryavanshi’s 32-ball ton makes him the joint-second fastest Indian to reach a T20 hundred, a feat shared with Rishabh Pant, who hammered a 32-ball century for Delhi against Himachal Pradesh in 2018.Only Urvil Patel and Abhishek Sharma, both of whom struck 28-ball hundreds in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (2024–25), sit above him.In the process, the young prodigy also surpassed Rohit Sharma ’s iconic 35-ball T20I century scored against Sri Lanka in 2017.India A opted to bat first, but an early wicket—Priyansh Arya for 10—did little to slow the carnage that was about to unfold.Once Suryavanshi found his rhythm, the UAE bowlers had no answers.

Poll What do you think was the key factor in Jasprit Bumrah's success on Day 1? Patience His skill Wicket conditions

India’s opening day against South Africa at Eden Gardens belonged to Jasprit Bumrah , and the fast bowler was quick to downplay any talk of magic after his decisive five-wicket haul.Instead, he credited patience and discipline for shaping India’s strong position in the first Test. Bumrah ’s 5/27 dismantled South Africa for 159 in 55 overs on a surface offering variable bounce but also quick scoring if bowlers drifted. India finished the day in control, with room left for their batters to take the game by the horns when play resumes on Saturday.Speaking after stumps, Bumrah said his approach was built on resisting the temptation to chase unplanned breakthroughs.“If you want success, you need patience,” he said, adding that the conditions demanded focus rather than searching for miracle deliveries.“Obviously, this is a wicket where the outfield is fast and the wicket is hard. If you're too desperate or you go for a magic ball, the runs come too fast.”He needed time to settle into his rhythm, going wicketless in his first five overs before hitting stride. His first strike came with a seaming ball that sent Ryan Rickelton’s stumps flying, opening the door for India. In his next spell, Bumrah prised out Aiden Markram for 31 with a rising delivery that brushed the glove and carried to a diving Rishabh Pant.Both dismissals shifted momentum firmly India’s way.While India chose four spinners on a pitch expected to take turn later in the match, it was Bumrah who led the attack through three tightly controlled spells. “You need to control your temptation and build pressure and see what are the tough run-scoring options,” he said. “If you continuously bowl in good areas, you'll get wickets.”Despite the dominance, Bumrah kept the larger picture in view. “Feels very good,” he said of his haul, before noting the challenge of making an impact in a spin-heavy line-up. “Very happy with the performance but job is still left in the Test match.”South Africa’s batting coach Ashwell Prince admitted his side had been outplayed. “It was a sensational bowling display, particularly from Bumrah,” Prince said, also acknowledging the contribution of India’s spinners.With Mohammed Siraj and Kuldeep Yadav adding two wickets each, India ended the day well ahead, leaving the second day poised to shape the direction of the Test and potentially take a substantial lead. At stumps on Day 1, India trailed by 122 runs.",2025-11-14T17:30:44.796171

Afghanistan spinner Allah Ghazanfar has expressed admiration for Indian cricket stars Rohit Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah , praising their character and performance while preparing for the upcoming Rising Stars Asia Cup 2025. The young bowler, who was recently signed by Mumbai Indians for the 2025 IPL season, shared his insights about learning from these experienced players through the IPL platform.Ghazanfar's journey in the IPL began when he was picked in the 2023 auction and later joined Kolkata Knight Riders as a replacement for Mujeeb ur Rahman, though he didn't play any matches that season.

Poll Who do you think was the most crucial player released by Punjab Kings ahead of the auction? Glenn Maxwell Aaron Hardie Kuldeep Sen Vishnu Vinod

Punjab Kings have begun their pre-auction reset by parting ways with four players — Glenn Maxwell, Aaron Hardie, Kuldeep Sen and Vishnu Vinod ahead of the IPL auction scheduled for December 16 in Abu Dhabi.The decision marks the franchise’s first major movement since their runners-up finish last season, where Punjab reached the final before losing to Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Despite their strong end to the campaign, the team has opted for a rebalanced squad as they prepare for the next phase.Maxwell’s release follows a difficult season in which the Australian all-rounder struggled for form. He appeared in seven matches, scoring a meagre 48 runs and taking four wickets, before a finger injury ruled him out of the remainder of the tournament.He was later replaced by fellow Australian Mitchell Owen, and the franchise has now chosen to move on.Hardie, who was bought for Rs 1.25 crore at the last auction, did not get a game through the season. His exit was confirmed to news agency PTI by an IPL source, with Punjab Kings looking to free up overseas slots heading into the December auction.Among the domestic names, both Kuldeep Sen and Vishnu Vinod leave without featuring in a single match in IPL 2025.Sen had joined the franchise for Rs 80 lakh at the mega auction but remained on the bench throughout Punjab’s run to the final. Vinod, who arrived ahead of the season, last played an IPL match in 2023 during his stint with Mumbai Indians.Punjab Kings are expected to announce more clarity on their retention strategy as the deadline closes, with the franchise preparing for a competitive auction pool and possible structural changes. Their run last year, which saw moments of inconsistency but ultimately culminated in a late push to the title clash has prompted a reassessment of squad depth in key roles.With several teams entering the auction looking for all-round options and domestic backups, Punjab’s released list adds four notable names to the player pool. The franchise will now look to rebuild around its core as it attempts another deep run in IPL 2026.",2025-11-14T17:30:48.048622

Koneru Humpy Exclusive: Why the Chess legend hasn't played since World Cup loss

Indian Grandmaster P Harikrishna secured a draw against Jose Eduardo Martinez Alcantara, while Arjun Erigaisi drew with Levon Aronian in the fifth round of the FIDE World Cup in Baku on Friday. The matches were part of the prestigious USD 2 million prize money tournament, where only 16 players remain from the initial 206 participants.Harikrishna, displaying his experience, chose the Two Knights variation as black against Martinez's Italian opening. The Peruvian-Mexican Grandmaster, who had previously upset Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Alexey Sarana, couldn't gain much advantage with his white pieces.The middle game saw routine maneuvers with Martinez holding an extra pawn but suffering from a fractured pawn structure. His decision to exchange queens in the middle game indicated he wasn't at his best in this round.Harikrishna, known for his endgame expertise, managed the position well despite being a pawn down. He secured a comfortable draw in 41 moves.Erigaisi, playing with white pieces, attempted to pressure Aronian, but the Armenian-turned-American player maintained solid defense throughout.The game reached a rook and pawns endgame where Arjun had an extra pawn, but the position naturally led to a draw.Most players in the fifth round opted for cautious play, avoiding unnecessary risks. The all-Russian match between Andrey Esipenko and Aleksey Grebnev ended in a draw, as did the game between Armenian Gabriel Sargissian and Uzbekistan's Nodirbek Yakubboev.Alexander Doncheko of Germany and Liem Le Quang of Vietnam also agreed to a peaceful result in their encounter.The tournament has significant implications for the upcoming Candidates tournament, which will determine the challenger for D Gukesh in the next world championship.Caruana Fabiano of United States, Anish Giri of Holland, and Matthias Bluebaum of Germany have already secured their spots in the Candidates tournament. Indian player R Praggnanadhaa is nearly assured of his place among the eight qualifying positions.American player Hikaru Nakamura is also virtually guaranteed a spot, with three remaining positions to be determined from the current World Cup.The fifth round's first game results showed Javokhir Sindarov facing Frederic Svane, while several matches ended in draws: Arjun Erigaisi versus Levon Aronia, Sam Shankland against Daniil Dubov, Alexander Donchenko versus Liem Le Quang, Gabriel Sargissian against Nodirbek Yakubboev, Andrey Esipenko versus Aleksey Grebnev, Sevian Samuel playing Wei Yi, and Jose Eduardo Martinez Alcantara drawing with P Harikrishna.The tournament continues with heightened competition as players aim to secure one of the top three positions to qualify for the Candidates tournament next year.",2025-11-14T17:30:49.690016

Poll Which bowler's performance impressed you the most on Day 1 of the Test? Mohammed Siraj Jasprit Bumrah Kuldeep Yadav Marco Jansen

India’s seamers enjoyed a dominant opening day at Eden Gardens, and Mohammed Siraj said the surface made run-scoring difficult after South Africa were dismissed for 159 in the first Test on Friday.Jasprit Bumrah led the charge with a decisive five-wicket haul, while Siraj and Kuldeep Yadav chipped in with two each to break South Africa’s early momentum.Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton had given the visitors a steady start, but the innings fell away quickly once the new-ball movement eased and the pitch began to behave unpredictably.Siraj said the conditions demanded discipline, especially once the shine came off.“The new ball was coming on nicely to the bat, but when the ball went soft, the bounce became low as well,” Siraj said after stumps.He added that the plan was to stay full and attack the stumps because the pitch kept offering something to bowlers willing to aim straight. “There has been some reverse swing on offer, if you bowl stump-to-stump, you'll get options to take wickets and it isn't easy for batters to score runs,” he said.He also pointed out the contrast between the two ends. “One end is fine to bat, the other end - the bounce is variable and it's tough to score,” Siraj said, summing up the challenges the bowlers exploited through the day.The right-arm quick explained that Bumrah’s inputs helped him fine-tune his approach during a key phase of the innings. “Jassi bhai just told me that the wicket-taking option was if you bowl at the stumps, you've LBW, bowled and even catches coming to play when the line is accurate,” he said, crediting the senior pacer’s guidance during the spell.South Africa’s innings, which began with promise, unravelled rapidly after the first hour. A collapse of ten wickets for 102 runs left India in control before their own batters faced the fading light.India closed on 37/1, with KL Rahul and Washington Sundar ensuring there was no late damage after Yashasvi Jaiswal fell to Marco Jansen.Siraj said the team was satisfied with its position at stumps. “We are in a good position having lost just one wicket. (Earlier) Markram and Rickelton put on a good stand, we did well to comeback and I think we're ahead in the match at the moment,” he said.The hosts trail by 122 runs heading into day two, with the pitch expected to keep testing both sides.",2025-11-14T17:30:52.991445

NEW DELHI: Fourteen-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi produced a stunning display of power-hitting, smashing a 32-ball century to light up India A’s opening clash against the UAE in the Rising Stars Asia Cup in Doha on Friday. His explosive knock set the tone for a massive total of 297/4.Suryavanshi, widely regarded as India’s next big batting prodigy, brought up his hundred in just 32 deliveries, hammering 10 fours and nine sixes by that point. With this milestone, he also became the first player ever to score a T20 century for India A.The young left-hander eventually departed for 144 in the 13th over, caught at deep cover, after a jaw-dropping assault featuring 15 sixes and 11 boundaries.His innings now stands as the joint third-fastest T20 century by an Indian, behind Urvil Patel and Abhishek Sharma, and alongside Rishabh Pant. He raced to his half-century in only 17 balls before accelerating even more brutally, taking just 15 deliveries to score the next 50. UAE’s bowlers had no answers to his relentless aggression.At just 14, he has already achieved a historic feat—becoming the first cricketer ever to score two T20 centuries in 35 balls or fewer.His 15 sixes also make him joint holder of the second-highest sixes hit by an Indian in a T20 innings, matching Punit Bisht, Shreyas Iyer and Bhanu Jagdish Pania.Earlier, India A won the toss and opted to bat. Suryavanshi opened alongside Priyansh Arya, who contributed a quick 10 off 6 before falling early. Naman Dhir then joined Vaibhav at No. 3 and played a steady hand, scoring 34 off 23 balls with three fours and two sixes.While Dhir anchored, Suryavanshi launched a ferocious counterattack, completely taking over the innings. After Dhir’s dismissal, captain Jitesh Sharma stepped in and continued the charge, but Vaibhav fell for a breathtaking 144 off just 42 balls, having struck 11 fours and 15 sixes.",2025-11-14T17:30:54.649749

'Control your temptations': Jasprit Bumrah reacts after stunning fifer against South Africa in 1st Test

Poll Who was the standout performer for India in the first Test? Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Siraj

NEW DELHI: India suffered an early setback on the opening day of the first Test at Eden Gardens in Kolkata when Yashasvi Jaiswal, looking scratchy from the outset, fell cheaply to South Africa pacer Marco Jansen. Jaiswal never appeared fully settled at the crease, and Jansen capitalised by targeting the awkward length just short of a driveable zone.The breakthrough came when Jansen dragged his length back and cramped the left-hander for room.Jaiswal, attempting to cut off the back foot despite limited space, only managed a thick inside edge. The ball ricocheted onto his leg stump, sending it cartwheeling.The stadium fell silent as Jaiswal stood momentarily in disbelief before trudging off for 12 off 27 balls, an innings that included three boundaries.It was the wicket Jansen had been relentlessly searching for, and it gave South Africa an early lift.Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir also appeared visibly miffed in the dressing room, and the cameras caught his reaction the moment Jaiswal threw away his wicket.However, the day belonged overwhelmingly to India’s fast-bowling spearhead Jasprit Bumrah , who produced a devastating spell to rip through South Africa’s batting lineup and finish with exceptional figures of 5 for 27.After winning the toss and electing to bat on a surface offering variable bounce, South Africa made a promising start, reaching 57 without loss in the 11th over. But once Bumrah found his rhythm and removed both openers in quick succession, the visitors spiralled into a dramatic collapse.Under relentless pressure, South Africa lost all ten wickets for just 102 runs. Their middle order struggled to cope with Bumrah’s precision, sharp movement, and sustained hostility as he claimed his 16th five-wicket haul in Test cricket. Supporting him effectively, Mohammed Siraj and Kuldeep Yadav picked up two wickets each, while Axar Patel added one.A crowd of around 35,000 roared Bumrah on during his fiery post-tea burst, and their anticipation peaked when he completed his five-wicket haul. South Africa were eventually bundled out for 159— their second-lowest first-innings total against India — squandering the advantage of winning the toss and handing India early control of the Test.",2025-11-14T17:30:58.033585

Shubman Gill Press Conference: Team India captain opens up about India’s bowling plan for SA Test

NEW DELHI: Fast-bowling spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was at his devastating best on Friday, producing a sensational spell of 5 for 27 to bowl out South Africa for just 159 on the opening day of the first Test at Eden Gardens.On a two-paced surface offering variable bounce, South Africa looked set for a strong total after winning the toss and reaching 57 for no loss in the 11th over. But the moment Bumrah broke through by removing both openers in quick succession, the visitors’ innings unraveled completely.South Africa went on to lose all ten wickets for just 102 runs, with their middle order crumbling under Bumrah’s unrelenting accuracy and movement off the pitch.This five-wicket haul was Bumrah’s 16th in Test cricket, a landmark that places him alongside Bhagwat Chandrasekhar on India’s all-time list.Among Indian bowlers, only legends like R Ashwin (37), Anil Kumble (35), Harbhajan Singh (25) and Kapil Dev (23) have more five-wicket hauls, highlighting Bumrah’s rapid rise in the longest format despite playing far fewer matches.Bumrah’s 5/27 also etched his name into the record books for a different reason.He became the first fast bowler since Ishant Sharma—during the day-night Test against Bangladesh at the same venue in 2019—to claim a five-wicket haul on the opening day of a Test in India.The last pacer to do so in a traditional red-ball Test was South Africa’s Dale Steyn in Ahmedabad back in 2008.Notably, Matt Henry also picked up a five-wicket haul on what officially became the second day of the Bengaluru Test last year, after the first day was washed out.Supporting Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Kuldeep Yadav struck twice each, while Axar Patel chipped in with a wicket to complete India’s dominant bowling performance.",2025-11-14T17:30:59.705566

KKR IPL 2026 trades, retentions, releases, squad update: Are they missing Gambhir?

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Suresh Raina believes KL Rahul is “the backbone” of Delhi Capitals, making it highly unlikely that the franchise will release him ahead of the IPL 2026 retention deadline.Rahul, who joined Delhi before IPL 2025, has been one of the standout performers of the season. With 539 runs in 13 innings at a strike rate close to 150—including a century and three fifties—he became the fastest player to reach 5,000 IPL runs. Raina emphasised that Rahul’s dual role as a wicketkeeper-batter makes him indispensable for the franchise.“He got a good price in the last auction and performed really well,” Raina said.“As a batter in T20 cricket, he gives you both a solid batter and a wicketkeeper. I don’t think Rahul will leave Delhi; he’s the backbone of the team. Even Axar has played really well in T20Is and ODIs over the last few years. So, I think he should definitely lead the team. The big question is whether they will retain Faf du Plessis or not.”While Delhi’s retention plans appear relatively clear, Royal Challengers Bengaluru face some tough decisions, according to JioStar expert Irfan Pathan.Speaking about Liam Livingstone, Pathan said: “RCB bought Liam Livingstone for a hefty price, but he scored only 112 runs and played at a strike rate of 133. His strike rate should have been higher. His performance of 112 runs in 10 matches doesn’t justify such a big price.”He further noted that financial considerations may force RCB to rethink Rasikh Salam’s position. “Bowler Rasikh Salam does have a place in this team, but his price is 6 crores. So, can RCB put Rasikh Salam back in the auction and try to take him again for a lower price? Because such a player is needed in the middle overs.”Raina, however, feels RCB are largely settled heading into 2026.“RCB’s bowling unit played really well last season, and even the batters did well. It was good to see a new IPL winner. The way Virat and Rajat Patidar have shaped the atmosphere of the team is good to see. They won’t make many changes… they will go with more or less the same squad. So, I think RCB is sorted. They can try to get a spinner, maybe someone who can play alongside Krunal Pandya.”Sunrisers Hyderabad, who started strongly last season before fading midway, are also reassessing their middle order and bowling attack.Raina highlighted the need for stability in the middle order: “SRH need a sensible middle-order batter. Ishan Kishan did very well initially; he made a few runs in the first two matches and has a different, aggressive batting approach. Then they have players like Heinrich Klaasen. I think Nitish Kumar Reddy will have to improve his performance because the team and the owners are banking on him a lot.”Matthew Hayden, meanwhile, pointed to the bowling unit as a key area requiring overhaul.“The big problem for SRH is their bowling attack. It’s a very good batting wicket in Hyderabad, so SRH need to find good bowlers. Some potential big releases are Mohammed Shami, Abhinav Manohar, and Rahul Chahar as well. They’ll be on the hunt for fast bowlers with variations in the mini-auction. They will need such bowlers on that track because it’s a pure batting pitch.”",2025-11-14T17:31:01.350987

Bishnoi, Miller likely to be released

NEW DELHI: In a bold move, Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) are likely to retain young fast bowler Mayank Yadav and buy India’s out-of-favour pacer Mohammed Shami from Sunrisers Hyderabad.The deadline for announcing the retentions for next year’s IPL is on Saturday. Retaining pace sensation Mayank Yadav is a major leap of faith since the speedster has been struggling with injuries and is currently undergoing rehab after a major surgery on his back in June. Mayank was retained last year for Rs 11 crores.LSG have invested heavily in Mayank for the last four years. Sources close to the development say that the franchise didn’t want to let go of the 23-year-old when he was going through bad time so early in his career.Mayank burst on to the scene in IPL 2024 when he consistently bowled above 150 kmph before getting injured after three games. The national selectors also handed him T20I cap against Bangladesh last Oct.“Mayank is seen as a generational talent. The franchise has groomed him and now that he is going through a rough patch, retaining him can give him more confidence. His recovery is on track. He has already resumed bowling fromOct end.He is likely to be fit for competitive cricket by the first week of Jan,” a BCCI source told TOI.As for Shami, TOI understands the franchise is trying to add as much experience to its bowling as possible. If the deal is finalised, it could be an all-cash deal worth approximately Rs 10 crore. LSG’s pace bowling resources were badly exposed last season. With former India bowling coach Bharat Arun in the ranks, the franchise hopes to rebuild its fast-bowling resources around Shami. One can’t expect too many good fast-bowling options at the mini-auction to be held in mid-Dec.TOI has also learnt that LSG are likely to release wrist-spinner Ravi Bishnoi and David Miller. Bishnoi endured two consecutive bad IPL seasons. His bowling has lacked penetration besides leaking runs at a high economy rate. David Miller too is likely to be released into the auction pool after he struggled to get going at the franchise last season. Unlike last season, one may expect captain Rishabh Pant to bat up the order.",2025-11-14T17:31:04.706392

Poll Which player do you think had the greatest impact on Bangladesh's victory? Mahmudul Hasan Joy Najmul Hossain Shanto Hasan Murad Taijul Islam

Bangladesh secured a commanding innings-and-47-run victory over Ireland in Sylhet, with the first Test match concluding on day four. The win was powered by Hasan Murad's four-wicket haul and centuries from Mahmudul Hasan Joy and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, with Bangladesh declaring at 587 for 8.Ireland managed to extend the match into the fourth day despite losing half their side the previous evening. Andy McBrine's resilient half-century provided some resistance for the visitors.The morning session of day four was marked by several DRS reviews that went in Ireland's favor. Matthew Humphreys successfully overturned a decision before falling to Taijul Islam, while McBrine survived two close reviews against Mehidy Hasan Miraz.McBrine's partnership with captain Andy Balbirnie, who batted at number eight due to a finger injury, produced 66 runs for the seventh wicket. Their stand offered brief hope for Ireland.The post-lunch session saw quick action as Nahid Rana dismissed McBrine for 52 off 106 balls, including five fours. The dismissal came from a short delivery that McBrine pulled to Murad at midwicket.Barry McCarthy and Jordan Neill mounted a late resistance with a 54-run partnership for the ninth wicket.Neill scored 36 with seven boundaries, while McCarthy contributed 25, including a six and two fours.Ireland's second innings began with a 301-run deficit. Paul Stirling showed some fight with 43 runs, including seven boundaries, before a hesitant run attempt led to his dismissal.The visitors' collapse continued as Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker fell lbw to Taijul and Murad respectively. Curtis Campher's departure, caught by Shadman Islam at cover, further deepened Ireland's troubles.Bangladesh's dominant first innings was highlighted by Mahmudul Hasan Joy's 171 and Najmul Hossain Shanto's 100. Ireland's Matthew Humphreys claimed five wickets for 170 runs.In the final analysis, Bangladesh's 587 for 8 declared proved too much for Ireland, who managed 286 in their first innings and 254 in their second. Hasan Murad finished with figures of 4-60, while Taijul Islam took 3-84.The second and final match of the series will begin on Wednesday in Dhaka.",2025-11-14T17:31:09.946986

Taking to X on Friday after it became clear that the Mahagathbandhan as a whole would not cross 40 seats while the NDA managed to win over 200 in the 243-member Assembly, Gandhi said the result was surprising and the bigger fight is for ""the protection of the Constitution and democracy"".

Without explicitly speaking about 'vote theft', over which he had also taken out a Voter Adhikar Yatra in Bihar, Gandhi wrote, ""I express my heartfelt gratitude to those millions of voters in Bihar who expressed their trust in the Mahagathbandhan. This result in Bihar is truly surprising. We could not achieve victory in an election that was not fair from the very beginning.""

""This fight is for the protection of the Constitution and democracy. The Congress party and the INDIA alliance will deeply review this result and make their efforts to save democracy even more effective,"" he added.

The Congress, which was blamed for underdelivering for the Mahagathbandhan when it won only 19 of the 70 seats it contested in 2020, managed to emerge victorious in a measly six out of 61 this time around. The RJD, the other main party in the alliance, fared even worse, winning only 25 of the 143 seats it was allotted, down from 75 out of 144 last time.

Allegations of misusing ""constitutional institutions"" were also made by Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge around the same time as Gandhi.

""We respect the decision of the people of Bihar and will continue our fight against those forces that are engaged in weakening democracy by misusing constitutional institutions. We will conduct a thorough study of the election results and will present a detailed perspective after understanding the reasons for the outcomes,"" Kharge wrote on X.

""I want to tell every Congress worker that there is no need for you to feel discouraged. You are our pride, honor, and glory. Your hard work is our strength. We will leave no stone unturned in raising awareness among the people. We will continue the struggle to save the Constitution and democracy by staying among the people. This fight is long - and we will fight it with complete dedication, courage, and truth,"" he added.",2025-11-14T17:31:12.830135

Having crossed the 200-seat mark in the 243-member House, the NDA has not only consolidated its position but also surpassed its strong 2010 performance.

Here is a look at the major winners and losers:

Big Winners

Nitish Kumar

After nearly two decades in power, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has successfully overcome anti-incumbency pressures. His Janata Dal (United) is leading in over 80 seats, contributing significantly to the NDA's sweeping mandate.

The outcome secures Kumar a fifth term as Chief Minister and halts the Opposition's attempt -- especially that of Tejashwi Yadav -- to project a ""youth versus experience"" narrative in Bihar.

Chirag Paswan

One of the biggest comeback stories of this election is Chirag Paswan. After winning only one seat in 2020, his Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) converted its nearly 6 per cent vote share into a remarkable performance, winning 22 of the 29 seats it contested.

A strong consolidation of the Paswan vote, coupled with Chirag's appeal among Dalits and young voters, has significantly boosted his political stature within the NDA.

Asaduddin Owaisi and AIMIM

The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), led by Asaduddin Owaisi, has delivered another strong performance in the Seemanchal region, a pocket where it has steadily expanded influence.

AIMIM won five seats -- Jokihat (Araria), Kochadhaman (Kishanganj), Amour (Purnea), Bahadurganj and Baisi (Purnea). These are the same constituencies it had secured in the 2020 elections, reflecting a firm hold on its support base.

HAM and RLM

Smaller NDA allies have punched above their weight. Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) of Jitan Ram Manjhi won five of the six seats it contested, while Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) of Upendra Kushwaha led in four seats.

The strong performance of these partners played a crucial role in the NDA crossing the 200-seat threshold.

Big Losers

Tejashwi's RJD

Despite being projected as the Opposition's chief ministerial face, Tejashwi Yadav failed to convert anti-incumbency into electoral gains -- even though he comfortably retained his Raghopur seat.

The RJD's tally of just 25 seats is slightly better than its performance in 2010, when it won only 22 seats.

After gaining momentum in 2020, the party's slide in 2025 dealt a major setback to Tejashwi's political career.

Rahul Gandhi and Congress

The Congress once again failed to make an impact in Bihar, ending with single-digit seats.

Despite Rahul Gandhi's ""Voter Adhikar Yatra"", allegations of ""vote chori,"" and criticism of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise, the party struggled to connect with voters.

This outcome continues the decline seen in 2020, when the Congress contested 70 seats but won just 19, weakening the Mahagathbandhan's prospects.

This time it contested 61 seats and has won three, and is ahead in three only.

Prashant Kishor

Political strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor, who is credited with helping several political parties win elections, finds himself among the most prominent losers.

Despite a two-year padyatra and high visibility, his Jan Suraaj platform failed to register any electoral impact -- polling fewer votes than NOTA in several seats.

His development-centric pitch failed to resonate, and his choice not to contest seats created confusion about the movement's direction.

Mukesh Sahani

Projected as a key player in the Seemanchal region, Mukesh Sahani -- named a deputy CM face of the Mahagathbandhan after hard negotiations -- failed to deliver. His Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) could not convert caste-based mobilisation into tangible gains.

The Nishad (fisherman) vote, which he sought to consolidate, appears to have swung decisively toward the NDA, attracted by targeted welfare assurances.

Kumar is the state's longest-serving chief minister. Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav won by over 11,000 votes in Raghopur.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing party workers and supporters at the BJP headquarters in Delhi after the NDA's landslide win in Bihar, congratulated people for reposing faith in democracy and the Election Commission by voting in record numbers in the assembly elections.

In a scathing attack on the Congress, PM Modi said it has no positive vision for the country and he had warned the Congress' allies that the party is a parasite and a liability for them.

He said the Bihar assembly win is the beginning of a new era and the state will progress faster in the next five years.

The trends showed the NDA had surpassed its 2020 results, when it secured 122 seats. The Mahagathbandhan, on the other hand, was leading in 33 seats while Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj party failed to open an account.

Besides Yadav, prominent candidates of both alliances include Deputy Chief Ministers Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha, Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD)'s Tej Pratap and Bihar Congress president Rajesh Kumar

The counting of votes began at 8am. Most exit polls have predicted a clean sweep for the NDA, of which the JD(U) is a part. Tejashwi Yadav has dismissed the predictions and claimed the Mahagathbandhan would form the government with a thumping majority.

The state registered a historic voter turnout of 67.13% in the two-phase elections to the 243-member assembly that was held on November 6 and 11.

Advocate Prashant Bhushan claimed before the top court that according to his information, ""the message came from the Chief Justice of a high court"" to the judicial member of the company's appellate tribunal.

Taking note of the sensational claim, a bench comprising Chief Justice of India-designate Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi transferred the case, in which the said judicial member has recused itself from hearing, from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) bench at Chennai to the NCLAT, principal bench at New Delhi.

""The larger issue raised in the matter is of vital importance and will be dealt with by the Chief Justice of India on the administrative side,"" the bench told Bhushan, appearing for a private firm AS Metcorp Private Ltd, in whose matter the judicial member of the NCLAT, Chennai recused himself.

It requested the NCLAT Chairperson Justice Ashok Bhushan to hear the matter in a bench headed by him and adjudicate the dispute at the earliest.

The top court also directed the interim resolution professional (IRP) appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal at Hyderabad to proceed in the insolvency dispute.

According to the bench, the said judicial member has recorded the incident in his order before recusing himself from hearing the matter, is enough for looking at the issue on the administrative side.

""Consequently, we direct that the company appeal pending before NCLAT, Chennai be transferred alongwith all records to the Principal bench, NCLAT at New Delhi in the peculiar facts of the case. We request the President, NCLAT to list the company appeal before his bench and decide the same after notice to the contesting party at the earliest,"" the top court ordered.

It further said that there can be no qualm that all other issues are of vital public importance and the competent authority must have examined the available material and taken necessary steps as may be required.

""In any case, all these issues can be effectively dealt with by the Chief Justice of India on the administrative side. We thus deem it appropriate to keep this writ petition as a representation bringing on record information for consideration by CJI. Let the law take its own course,"" the top court said.

Bhushan said that based on the material, it is evident that it is an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) and an appropriate course would be to lodge the case against the senior judicial officer who approached him.

He submitted that according to his information, ""the message came from the Chief Justice of a High Court"".

Bhushan further said the judicial member of the NCLAT has kept the screenshot of the WhatsApp message and shown it to the party in the insolvency dispute, saying he was approached by one of the most revered members of the higher judiciary seeking an order favouring a particular party.

The bench said it would not like to comment any further as it has ordered the matter to be placed before the Chief Justice of India, who will look into the issue on the administrative side.

The petition, filed by AS Met Corp Private Ltd, arises from proceedings before the NCLAT Chennai relating to the insolvency of KLSR Infratech Ltd.

On August 13, 2025, during the hearing in the NCLAT, Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma created a sensation by stating in an open court that he had received messages from a senior member of the higher judiciary pressing him to rule in favour of a particular party.

He also showed the messages on his phone to one of the counsels present and immediately recused himself.

According to the petitioner private firm, the approach was allegedly made to favour the other party. Justice Sharma recorded in the order, which was uploaded later the same day, that he was approached by ""one of the most revered members of the higher judiciary"" but did not mention on whose behalf the approach was made.

The writ petition before the top court sought registration of an FIR for offences under the PCA disclosed by the incident, including provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).

It said the top court's earlier ruling had held that a criminal investigation into alleged judicial corruption cannot be substituted by any internal ""inhouse"" fact-finding.

The private firm has also sought a court-monitored probe by an independent agency after preserving the electronic evidence, including video and audio of the August 13, proceedings, which the NCLAT registrar has refused to share, citing a lack of enabling rules.

""I am certain that the NDA will register its biggest-ever victory in Bihar this year. Prepare for a Vijayotsav (grand celebration) on November 14,"" PM Modi can be heard saying in the viral video.

He made the assertion in one of the many political rallies that he addressed in the run-up to the Bihar assembly elections. This evening, he will address the BJP workers at the party's office in the national capital over the landslide victory.

With leads and wins in 202 seats, the NDA has failed to break its 2010 election record, in which it secured 206 seats.

In the 243-member Bihar assembly, the BJP has emerged as the single largest party with wins and leads in 89 seats. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JDU is leading in 85 seats, Union Minister Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) in 19, Union Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha in five, and Rajya Sabha MP Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcha in four, as per the data from the Election Commission (EC).

The 2010 elections saw the NDA winning 206 seats with the JD(U) winning 115, and the BJP 91.

""Bihar's mandate is clear. The people have made it clear - now development is the identity. Not jungle raj, good governance is needed,"" said the BJP on X.

Political analysts have said one of the key factors in the Bihar election was the role of women voters. Their unprecedented turnout is said to have handed the victory to the Nitish Kumar government on a platter.

The BJP transferred Rs 10,000 each into the bank accounts of 75 lakh women - a total of Rs 7,500 crore - just before the elections.

Bihar registered a historic voter turnout of 67.13 per cent, the highest-ever in the state. Women's voter turnout was 71.78 per cent, while men's was 62.98 per cent.

The state voted in two phases on November 6 and November 11.

The Bihar assembly election result, with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) winning over 200 of the 243 seats, reveal not just numbers but a nuanced narrative of aspiration, identity, and hope. What we see in these results is not merely a political sweep but a profound reflection of the electorate's evolving consciousness. Nitish Kumar's party, JD(U), leads in 85 seats, in an extraordinary doubling of the 43 seats won in 2020.

The Resonance Of Historical Patterns

To understand the magnitude of this moment, we must reflect on the past. The NDA's resurgence evokes memories of the 2010 elections, when political fortunes shifted dramatically. The ""Miracle of 2010"" saw the NDA winning 206 seats (115 for the JD(U) and 91 for the BJP), harnessing the aspirations of the common people and capturing the imagination of the electorate with promises of development and stability. Fast forward to 2025, and we see the reverberations of that historic moment playing out once more, as the Modi-Nitish ""jugalbandhi""—a harmonious partnership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar—proves potent yet again.

The magic of this collaboration lies not just in its strategic alignment but in its genuine outreach to diverse voter segments. Their alliance signals a commitment to governance that resonates with both urban and rural constituents. This symbiotic relationship, akin to the rhythm of a well-rehearsed duet, amplifies the voices of a multitude, framing political discourse within the realms of progress and unity.

Women Voters: The Unsung Heroes

As we delve deeper into the narrative, the role of women voters emerges as a pivotal theme. Their unprecedented turnout was a testament to the transformative power of political engagement. In the heart of Bihar's villages and cities alike, women have long been marginalised, their voices often drowned out in the cacophony of political rhetoric. Yet in these elections, they have risen, asserting their presence and demanding recognition.

The surge of women voters played a crucial role in the Nitish wave phenomenon, characterized not just by numbers at the polls but by a collective aspiration for change. The attention to issues such as infrastructure (roads, electricity, and water) and women's safety reflects a broader societal shift, where the electorate is not just voting for a candidate but for a vision that intertwines their hopes with the promise of a better future. The NDA's focus on women-centric policies, plus prohibition, coupled with grassroots engagement, resonated deeply, thereby shaping the electoral narrative. Women voters, across castes and across regions, have voted overwhelmingly for the Nitish Kumar-led government and PM Modi.

A New Chapter in Bihar's Political Saga

The results of the Bihar assembly elections extend beyond the immediate triumph of the NDA. They forecast a new chapter in Bihar's political saga, one poised on the cusp of transformation. The substantial victory signifies not just party loyalty but speaks to the electorate's desire for continuity amid change—a paradox that defines contemporary Indian politics.

As we analyze the numbers, the contrast with the Mahagathbandhan's downfall—now reduced to 64 seats—brings into sharp relief the challenges faced by opposition alliances. The RJD, the single largest party in the past, has been reduced to number three today, behind the JD(U) and the BJP. While the Mahagathbandhan sought to craft a narrative of unity and collective strength, the result suggests a disconnect with the aspirations of a significant voter base. In the political arena, where narratives are shaped by the perceptions of the moment, the inability to resonate with the electorate has led to their retreat, underscoring the complexities of coalition politics in India.

While the NDA's campaign was based on hope and optimism for a better future for Bihar, the Mahagathbandhan fought on the basis of despair and a negative picture: vote theft, unemployment, corruption, and economic stagnation.

Echoes of Hope and Change

In the final analysis, the 2025 Bihar assembly elections underscore the dynamism of Indian democracy, where the interplay of strategy, identity, and aspirations shapes electoral outcomes. The NDA's sweeping victory is not merely an electoral mandate; it is an affirmation of the electorate's hunger for progress, inclusivity, and governance that acknowledges their lived realities.

As we look to the future, the challenge will lie in sustaining this momentum, ensuring that the aspirations of all—especially women and marginalized communities—are not only heard but valued. In this vibrant mosaic of political engagement, the ethos of Bihar, like the vibrant colours of its festivals, will continue to evolve, reminding us that in the heart of democracy lies the timeless pursuit of hope, change, and a better tomorrow.",2025-11-14T17:31:24.920603

The Congress party registered crucial wins in two separate states. In Rajasthan's Anta, Pramod Jain ""Bhaya"" defeated the BJP's Morpal Suman and Independent Naresh Meena, securing 69,571 votes and winning by a margin of 15,612 votes. The party also celebrated a victory in the Telangana's Jubilee Hills by-poll, where Naveen Yadav was declared the winner.

The BJP marked its dominance in two key areas. In Jammu & Kashmir's Nagrota, Devyani Rana secured a massive victory, winning by a substantial margin of 24,647 votes. Similarly, in Odisha's Nuapada, the BJP's Jay Dholakia achieved a landslide victory, securing over a lakh votes and winning by a margin of 83,748.

Regional parties proved their resilience in their respective strongholds. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) secured a significant victory in J&K's Budgam, where Muntazir Mehdi won with 21,576 votes, defeating the National Conference and an independent candidate by a margin of 4,478 votes. The BJP's candidate, Mohsin Mosvi, finished sixth with a low count of 2,619 votes.

In Jharkhand, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha successfully retained its stronghold in the Ghatsila constituency, with Somesh Chandra Soren securing a total of 1,04,936 votes and defeating the BJP's Babu Lal Soren by a margin of 38,601 votes.

In Mizoram, the Mizo National Front (MNF) successfully retained the Dampa constituency with Dr R Lalthangliana winning by a narrow 562 votes.

Furthermore, the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab successfully defended the Tarn Taran Assembly seat in the by-elections.

""The Congress criticises the Election Commission, makes frivolous complaints about baseless issues like 'vote chori', divides people on basis of religion and caste... The Congress has no positive vision for the country,"" he said in his address to BJP workers and supporters at party headquarters in Delhi.

""The truth is that today, Congress, and I say this very seriously, today Congress has become the Muslim League Maoist Congress... And the entire agenda of Congress now runs on this. And because of this, even within Congress, a new branch is emerging, which is even worse than this negative politics,"" he said.

The emergence of this section, he said, has created deep disappointment within the Congress ranks.

""And I have a suspicion that there may be another big division of Congress in the future. And friends, the supporters of Congress have also begun to understand that Congress is drowning everyone in its negative politics. Everyone is drowning at the same time,"" he added.

While Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal has posted one of its worst performances in Bihar today, leading in around 25 seats, the Congress has slipped from the 19 seats it won in 2020 to leading in around five seats. Its vote share has also plunged from 9.48 per cent to around 8 per cent.

The party's performance in 2020 was considered sub-par and it had upset ally RJD and cast a shadow on the seat sharing process this time. The two parties failed to come to a consensus and ended up fielding candidates unilaterally, leading to friendly contests in a handful of seats.

Both parties, however, insisted it was deliberate and was dictated by the ground realities in various seats.

The Congress also ran a lacklustre campaign ahead of the election which had fizzled out after the initial adrenalin-driven Voter Adhikar Yatra led by Rahul Gandhi. On a few occasions, he was joined by Tejashwi Yadav on stage. But by the time the BJP's formidable election machinery swept the state, Gandhi was missing in action, leaving the RJD upset.

The upshot -- the NDA is now set to sweep Bihar, surging ahead in around 200 of the state's 243 seats. The BJP is set to emerge as the single-largest party with nearly 95 per cent strike rate, reaffirming the popularity of PM Modi. A resurgent JDU is close behind, with voters backing the aging Nitish Kumar despite reports of anti-incumbency and his ill health.",2025-11-14T17:31:34.601417

Having bargained hard to get 29 constituencies for his Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) in the top-heavy NDA, party chief Chirag Paswan appears to have proved his mettle by winning or leading in 19 - a strike rate of 65%. The fact that this comes after the party won all five seats it contested in the Lok Sabha elections last year and had almost been written off after the 2020 Assembly polls will only help establish Paswan's political credentials. Live updates here.

In 2020, the then-united LJP contested independently because of differences with JDU chief Nitish Kumar and won only one of the over 130 seats it contested. Even though the party managed to get a decent vote share and played spoiler for the JDU in several seats, many political analysts thought Chirag did not have the charisma and political acumen to carry forward the legacy of his father, Ram Vilas Paswan, seen as a colossus in Bihar politics.

Making things worse for Chirag, the party split in 2021 after his uncle, Pashupati Kumar Paras, also made a bid for ownership of Ram Vilas Paswan's legacy.

Then came a hard-fought resurgence. At 43 years old - which is young by Indian political standards - Chirag positioned himself as a youth leader - calling himself a 'Yuva Bihari' - while sticking to his party's roots of championing the Dalit cause.

The hard work put in by Chirag and the rest of his party paid off in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, when it won all five constituencies it contested, establishing itself as a serious player with a 100% strike rate.

Despite the success, however, the key parties of the NDA, the BJP and the JDU, were said to be reluctant to cede more than 20 of Bihar's 243 constituencies to the LJP (RV) for the Assembly elections. Chirag then reportedly opened negotiations with Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj Party, signalling that he was not willing to be taken for granted, and eventually wrangled 29 constituencies from the ruling alliance.

What Next?

Chirag had indicated before the elections that he would make a pitch for a deputy chief minister post while also tempering expectations of his party workers who, he said, would like to see him in the topmost post in the state.

""The Chief Minister's post has never been vacant in 2025. I respect the sentiments of party workers. I agree that they must aspire to see their leader in the topmost post. If your worker doesn't believe you can reach the top post, then you have failed to motivate them. I always wanted my father Ram Vilas Paswan ji to become the Prime Minister,"" he had told NDTV in an exclusive pre-poll interview.

""I don't know what the future holds. But I first cross a level and then decide on the next strategy. My immediate priorities after the Bihar elections are the Uttar Pradesh and Punjab polls in 2027. Then in the 2029 Lok Sabha elections, I want to see my prime minister get elected for the fourth time. And then we will focus on 2030,"" he said.

Days before the results, Chirag also reiterated his unwavering loyalty to PM Modi, dismissing the possibility of allying with someone else if the numbers turned out to be different than the NDA expected.

""I do speak with Priyanka (Gandhi) ji, and I want to emphasise again that as long as my Prime Minister is there, I am absolutely not going anywhere. My dedication and my love remain. I love him a bit too much,"" he said.

'Landslide Win'

Terming it a ""landslide win"" for the NDA, LJP(RV) MP Shambhavi Chaudhary told NDTV the core reason for the victory was the alliance's ""development-oriented politics"".

To a question whether this sets the stage for Chirag Paswan to emerge as the top leader of the extremely backward classes by 2030, Chaudhary said the party's current focus is on delivering on its promises.",2025-11-14T17:31:36.425078

Michiko Miyamoto, the India director of the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO), heard testimonies of domestic workers who highlighted issues such as non-payment of wages, discrimination, physical and sexual harassment, and absence of workers' rights.

Miyamoto commended the NPDW for not only taking forward the issues of domestic workers, but for giving them a public voice as they are otherwise invisible, the workers' body said in a statement.

Experts at the discussion agreed that rights for domestic workers need a change of heart in society in general because the society - while dependent on domestic workers - looks down on them.

Deepangkar Guha, Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Labour and Employment, highlighted the importance and need for a national law to protect domestic workers. He said several private members bills have been presented to the government, and so it should keep its commitment to 'Convention 189', which India had signed.

Convention 189 or the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 is an international treaty by the ILO that sets up standards for decent work for domestic workers globally.

Domestic workers have been demanding a law for decades and at least 17 draft bills have been developed and some presented in parliament. These bills have progressively developed in their scope and the one developed by the NPDW is also comprehensive, experts said.

A panel of employers' associations representing both employers of domestic workers and the industrial sector pointed at the new draft labour policy of the government, which it said is meant to be inclusive but has nothing for domestic workers.

ILO specialist Ravindran Pieres said the employers associations have made a pledge to take forward protections for domestic workers. The chairperson of the Women and Child Commission also agreed there is a need for a law for domestic workers and also called for their protection under the POSH Act.

Justice Bidyut Ranjan Sarangi, chair of the National Human Rights Commission, stressed on the need for a comprehensive law for domestic workers, while MP Senthil said he would take the campaign for a comprehensive law forward.",2025-11-14T17:31:40.318792

The RJD, which contested 143 seats in the 243-member assembly, is currently leading in only 25 seats. These polls are also likely to be the RJD's second-worst performance in a Bihar election after 2010, when it had secured just 22 seats.

Tejashwi Yadav, the chief ministerial face of the Opposition Mahagathbandhan, is also currently trailing from his Raghopur seat. He has so far received 33,347 votes and is trailing BJP's Satish Kumar by 2,288 votes.

RJD's allies in the opposition bloc, Mahagathbandhan, were also way behind, with the Congress ahead in five seats, the CPIM(L) Liberation in two, and the CPI in zero.

On the other hand, the NDA is currently ahead in 204 seats, with the BJP leading in 92, the JDU in 84, Union Minister Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) in 19, Union Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha in five, and Rajya Sabha MP Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcha in four.

Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), SAS Nagar, Harmandeep Hans, said two individuals, Sachin and Gurdeep, were arrested. Both the accused are residents of Haryana's Kurukshetra.

Police acted on a tip-off regarding the movement of two suspects linked to an interstate syndicate involved in circulating fake currency, said SSP Hans. Special teams were constituted under the supervision of Superintendent of Police (SP) Rural Manpreet Singh and Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Dera Bassi Bikramjit Singh Brar.

The teams laid a naka near the PWD Rest House, Ghaggar Bridge, on the Old Ambala-Kalka Highway, and intercepted the suspects who were travelling in a white Scorpio.

Combination Of Currency Recovered

The following are the details of the recovery:

Original Currency Recovered:

- Rs 7,42,000 in old Rs 1,000 notes

- Rs 3,50,000 in old Rs 2,000 notes

- Rs 13,000 in new Rs 500 notes

Total Original Currency: Rs 11,05,000

Fake Currency Recovered:

- 80 bundles of old Rs 1000 notes (approx. Rs 80 lakh)

- 60 bundles of new Rs 500 notes (approx. Rs 30 lakh)

- 439 bundles of Rs 2000 notes (approx. Rs 8 crore 78 lakh)

Total Fake Currency: Approx. Rs 9,88,00,000

The party had pulled off a stunner in the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, winning five seats, all of them in the Seemanchal region of the state. And it repeated the feat this time as well.

Comprising four districts - Araria, Katihar, Kishanganj and Purnea - Seemanchal has 24 Assembly seats and a large portion of the state's Muslim population. The AIMIM was, thus, pinning its hopes on this region to stay relevant in the state, and it delivered.

The party has won the same five constituencies - Kochadhaman and Bahadurganj in Kishanganj district, Amour and Baisi in Purnea, Jokihat in Araria - proving that its 2020 result was not a one-off.

What makes the AIMIM's performance even more spectacular is that four of its MLAs had defected to the RJD after the 2020 elections, and only the winner from Amour, Akhtarul Iman, had remained with the party. Iman won the seat again this time.

The AIMIM was also forced to go it alone after its attempts to tie up with the Mahagathbandhan failed, and it pointed this out to the opposition alliance on Friday, after the trends became clear.

""In the beginning, we had gone to them and offered to contest together. But they were too arrogant,"" senior party leader Waris Pathan said.

""The RJD and the Congress are themselves responsible for the division of minority votes. We asked them to contest together and sought only six seats from the Mahagathbandhan, but they refused,"" he added.

Also, this would be the RJD's second-worst showing in a Bihar election. In the 2005 Assembly polls, when Nitish Kumar came to power in Bihar after a thumping NDA victory, the RJD had won 55 seats. At the time, Tejashwi Yadav's mother, Rabri Devi, was the Chief Minister, and RJD was facing mounting anti-incumbency in the hinterland state. A resurgent Nitish Kumar had teamed up with the BJP and scored a thumping win, ending the RJD's rule in Bihar. The RJD's worst show came in the next election in 2010, when RJD managed just 22 seats.

Twenty years and Nitish Kumar's multiple flip-flops later, the BJP and JDU are together again and are set for another big win. They have won 52 seats and are leading in 22 in the 243-member Assembly. The figures show that Tejashwi Yadav has led his party to its worst rout. The 36-year-old has taken charge of the party, founded by his father and veteran politician Lalu Yadav. Lalu Yadav founded RJD in 1997 and led the party to its best poll victories.

Interestingly, RJD still has the highest vote share among all the parties contesting the polls. This would mean that while it has won some seats with huge margins, it failed to convert close fights into victories.

Several rounds of counting are, however, left, and the picture may change as more votes are counted. But as of now, RJD is lagging far behind and the NDA seems set to form the government again.",2025-11-14T17:31:49.437492

The bodies were returned after Hamas late Thursday handed over the body of one of the last four remaining Israeli hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that launched the war in Gaza.

Israel identified the returned body as that of Meny Godard, who was abducted from Kibbutz Be'eri in southern Israel. His wife, Ayelet, was killed during the attack.

The armed wings of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad said Godard's body was recovered in southern Gaza.

The bodies of 25 hostages have been returned to Israel since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 10. There are still three more in Gaza that need to be recovered and handed over. Hamas returned 20 living hostages to Israel on Oct. 13.

For each hostage returned, Israel has released the bodies of 15 Palestinians, an exchange central to the ceasefire's first phase. Overall, the number of bodies of Palestinians received so far is 330, of which only 95 have been formally identified, according to Gaza Health Ministry officials.

Also on Friday, the bodies of 27 unidentified Palestinians were interred in Deir al-Balah. Some 182 Palestinians whose identity wasn't ascertained have already been buried, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

Health officials in Gaza have said identifying the bodies handed over by Israel is complicated by a lack of DNA testing kits.

The exchanges have gone ahead even as Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating other terms of the deal. Israel has accused Hamas of handing over partial bodies in some instances and staging the discovery of bodies in others, while Hamas has accused Israel of opening fire at civilians and restricting the flow of humanitarian aid into the territory.

The UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, on Friday joined a chorus of condemnation over a recent string of attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, urging an end to the violence and for Israel to hold the perpetrators accountable.

UN Human Rights Commissioner spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said Turk also called on Israel to end its ""unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory,"" immediately stop all new settlement activities and evacuate all settlers.

Al-Kheetan said more than 260 attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians were recorded in October, more than in any month since 2006.

""We reiterate that the Israeli government's assertion of sovereignty over the occupied West Bank and its annexation of parts of it are in breach of international law, as the International Court of Justice has confirmed,"" said Al-Kheetan.

Israeli settlers on Thursday torched and defaced a mosque in a Palestinian village in the central West Bank. That followed violence two days earlier, during which dozens of masked Israeli settlers set fire to vehicles and other property in the Palestinian villages of Beit Lid and Deir Sharaf.

The attacks on the two Palestinian villages prompted Israeli President Isaac Herzog to denounce them as ""shocking and serious."" Israeli army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, said the military ""will not tolerate the phenomena of a minority of criminals who tarnish a law-abiding public.""

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that there's concern that the events in the West Bank ""could undermine what we're doing in Gaza.""

Israeli officials have sought to cast settler violence as the work of a few extremists. But Palestinians and rights groups say that the violence is widespread and carried out by settlers across the territory, with impunity from Israel's far-right government, led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who hasn't commented on the surge in violence.

Meanwhile, the Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank said six teenagers - aged 15 to 17 - were shot and killed by Israeli fire in four separate incidents over the last two weeks. In the most recent incident on Thursday, two 15-year-old boys were killed near the village of Beit Ummar.

The Israeli military said in three of the four incidents, its soldiers were responding to ""terrorists"" hurling either Molotov cocktails or explosives, or were in the process of carrying out a ""terror attack."" In one incident, the military said troops acting according to ""standard operating procedures"" opened fire against Palestinians throwing rocks to ""remove the threat.""

The next parts of the 20-point plan call for creating an international stabilisation force, forming a technocratic Palestinian government and disarming Hamas.

The fragile agreement aims to wind down the war that was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage.

Israel responded with a sweeping military offensive that has killed more than 69,100 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

After 31 rounds of counting, Jyoti Singh secured 23,469 votes. Winner Arun Singh secured 74,157 votes while Mahabali Singh of the JDU won 71,321 votes, losing by 2,836 votes.

The ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, which includes Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JDU, is headed for a landslide win in Bihar, sending the Opposition into a tailspin. The NDA has crossed the 200-mark in the 243-seat assembly.

The high-profile Karakat seat saw a multi-cornered contest among JDU's Mahabali Singh, CPI(ML)'s Arun Singh, Jan Suraaj's Yogendra Singh.

Jyoti Singh's decision to contest the polls as an Independent came days after she met with election strategist-turned politician Prashant Kishor. No details of the meeting, however, were available.

In the lead-up to the polls, Jyoti Singh had accused her husband, Pawan, of infidelity, and there was an open fight over who would contest.

Pawan Singh, who was dropped by the BJP last year due to his controversial image, withdrew from the polls, underlining he was a ""true soldier"" of the BJP.

""The river Ganga flows to Bengal via Bihar. And the victory in Bihar, like the river, has paved the way for our victory in Bengal,"" PM Modi said toward the end of his hour-long speech.

The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) swept the Bihar election by winning over 200 of the 243 seats, with the BJP standing tall as the single-largest party.

""Your hopes are my pledge and your dreams are my inspiration. For the BJP, the party workers are its strength,"" PM Modi said, crediting the karyakartas for the stellar performance in Bihar.

Alluding to the decimation of the Mahagathbandhan, the Opposition alliance which the BJP had said would bring ""Jungle Raj"" if people elected them, PM Modi appealed to the people of Bengal to ""uproot Jungle Raj"" from their state too.

""Not just in Bengal, this victory will inspire our workers in the south too,"" PM Modi said.

Earlier in the day when trends showed the NDA's spectacular performance in Bihar, BJP leaders had already started talking about Bengal. BJP's Giriraj Singh's warning to Banerjee to ""brace for the worst"" found support from Bengal BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, who said Bengal would see a ""spectacular"" BJP win in the election next year.

Union Minister Sukanta Majumdar, invoking his 'Mission Bengal' theme, added a sharper edge: ""Now the time comes to clean up the jungles of Bengal.""

The Trinamool Congress on its official social media handle responded to the BJP's challenge.

""Bring it on,"" the ruling party in Bengal said. The post had an old video of Banerjee in which she was heard saying, ""It is not easy to play with us.""

""Uou slink into Bengal, groveling for votes, after branding our sacred land 'a state of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas.' To a party that wallows in such despicable slander, we hurl one searing question: Have you no shame at all?"" the Trinamool Congress said.

""In 2026, the people of Bengal will democratically crush your arrogance underfoot and send you crawling back in disgrace. You are not welcome here, and you never will be,"" it said.

A group of 153 Palestinians arrived at OR Tambo international iarport in Johannesburg on a chartered Global Airways flight from Kenya on Thursday without departure stamps, return tickets or details of accommodation, according to the border authorities.

They said none of the Palestinians had applied for asylum, leading to their initial denial of entry. A pastor who was allowed to meet the passengers while they were stuck on the plane said it was extremely hot and that children were screaming and crying. A humanitarian group intervened to offer accommodation and support and the authorities then cleared 130 members of the group for entry under a standard 90-day visa exemption, while the other 23 had already departed for other destinations. It was not clear where their journey originated. Palestinians in Israeli-blockaded Gaza or the Israeli-occupied West Bank cannot easily go abroad.

“These are people from Gaza who somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi and came here,” South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, told reporters on Friday. He said the group had been admitted to the country “out of compassion” but that “the details” of their situation would be investigated.

“We obviously need to look at the origins [of the Palestinians’ journey], where it started, the reason why they’ve been brought here.”

Details about how the group left Gaza remain elusive but the Gift of the Givers Foundation, a local nonprofit working in disaster response, said it was the second plane carrying Palestinians to land in South Africa in the last two weeks.

“The Palestinians had no idea where they were bundled off to, only when in Kenya did they realise they were coming to South Africa. Some had visas for Canada, Australia and Malaysia, they were eventually permitted to leave for those countries,” said Imtiaz Sooliman, the chair and founder of Gift of the Givers.

The Palestinian embassy in South Africa said the travel of both groups “was arranged by an unregistered and misleading organisation that exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner”.

The pastor who was allowed the plane while it was on the tarmac told the national broadcaster SABC: “When I came on to the plane it was excruciatingly hot. There were lots of children just sweating and screaming and crying.”

The episode has revived debate over South Africa’s approach to the war in Gaza. The country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa, has largely been supportive of the Palestinian cause and criticised Israel’s war with Hamas. The government filed a case against Israel with the international court of justice in 2023, accusing it of genocide in the Palestinian territory. Civil society movements, inspired by South Africa’s anti-apartheid legacy, actively organise solidarity campaigns, boycotts, and aid efforts for Palestinians.

The prolonged delay on the tarmac has led some South Africans to accuse the government of being slow to act on its proclaimed support. Others see the lack of information about the flights as worrying for national security.

Later on Friday, Leon Schreiber, the home affairs minister, said none of the travellers from Palestine had applied for asylum.

“Once satisfied that the absence of certain elements from their itinerary would not leave them destitute in South Africa in the absence of any asylum claims, the travellers were granted entry into South Africa on the standard 90-day visa exemption, subject to compliance with the standard conditions,” he said.",2025-11-14T17:31:58.013656

Abd el-Fattah was pardoned after more than 10 years in jail but his status, including his right to travel back and forth between Britain and Egypt, was left unclear and subject to discussion between the family and authorities.

He had been due to travel to the UK on Tuesday in part to attend two conferences, including the Magnitsky human rights awards in London.

Sanaa Seif, Abd el-Fattah’s sister, confirmed in a speech to the awards ceremony that her brother was stopped from flying to the UK by Egyptian passport control earlier in the week.

He attempted to fly to London with Seif on Tuesday morning but was told at Cairo international airport that he was not allowed to travel.

Abd el-Fattah was pardoned by President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi on 22 September and released from Wadi el-Natrun prison later that day, but it has not been clear whether he is able to travel to the UK to be reunited with his son, Khaled, in Brighton.

Abd el-Fattah and his mother, Laila Soueif, were on Thursday awarded the Courage Under Fire award at the Magnitsky awards. Seif collected the award on behalf of her brother and mother.

Speaking at the event, Seif said: “I wish my brother could be here tonight to accept this award. I wish he could be reunited with his son, Khaled, in Brighton.

“But on Tuesday morning we went to Cairo airport together to come to London, and he was stopped by Egyptian authorities at passport control and they refused to allow him to travel with me.”

Abd el-Fattah has conducted interviews about his experience of freedom in the British press, including the Guardian as well in the Egyptian dissident press. He had indicated he needed time to think about his future.

His son, Khaled, is 13 and lives with his mother in Brighton where he attends a special educational needs school. When Abd el-Fattah was released, Khaled visited him in Egypt, but he has returned to Brighton.

Soueif conducted a 287-day hunger strike to press for the release of her son, which she started on 29 September 2024 after Egyptian authorities failed to release him at the end of his latest five-year sentence. Abd el-Fattah had been imprisoned for “spreading fake news” after sharing a Facebook post about torture in Egypt.

Soueif ended her hunger strike on Monday 14 July 2025 after 287 days without food. During this time she was in St Thomas’ hospital in London and came close to death on two occasions, in late February and June 2025.",2025-11-14T17:32:00.000666

The report by the investigative and policy body the Sentry states that “politicians and security leaders who claim to serve the public and fight organised crime have, in fact, acted as the chief architects of Libya’s fuel-smuggling industry, often with backing from foreign states”. Some of the imported fuel has also been smuggled into Sudan, where it has prolonged that country’s civil war.

Sentry calls for a western-backed investigation into the Libyan oil officials known to be at the heart of the fuel-smuggling enterprise and for international help to ensure Libya’s own investigative bodies identify those who have stolen funds from the Libyan people.

Fuel smuggling has been a long-standing problem in Libya, but the report claims the sums involved rose sharply after 2022 after a change to the leadership of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC), one of the few state bodies that spans the east-west divisions that have effectively created two governments since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The NOC introduced a system whereby plentiful Libyan crude oil was swapped for imported refined fuel, which instead of being consumed in the Libyan market at subsidised prices was resold abroad at vast profit.

By late 2024, the NOC’s fuel imports had surged from about 20.4m litres per day in early 2021 to a peak of more than 41m litres per day by late 2024. No genuine surge in domestic demand for refined petrol could justify such a large increase, and Sentry claims more than half the imported refined petrol has been sold on by criminal networks at a private profit.

Libya still has little domestic oil refining capacity.

Sentry calculates more than $6.7bn-worth of fuel was smuggled out of the country in 2024 alone, sufficient for Libya to more than triple its spending on healthcare and education.

The report claims: “Given its sheer scale, fuel smuggling can no longer be portrayed merely as a byproduct of weak governance. In 2021, Libya’s top rulers effectively embraced it as part of a broader, systematic strategy to siphon massive wealth from the population.

“Kleptocrats and organised crime networks – working alongside corrupt officials who wield influence over state bureaucracy, logistical hubs, distribution points, routes, and border crossings – orchestrated a drastic increase in illegal export of subsidised fuel. Destinations include Sudan, Chad, Niger, Tunisia, Albania, Malta, Italy and Turkey.

“The transportation methods involve various categories of vessels, tanker trucks, and smaller vehicles – even rogue pipelines, depending on the geographical context and specific circumstances of the business model. This illegal fuel exportation causes domestic shortages, forcing citizens to pay much higher prices at unofficial outlets, especially in Libya’s peripheral area.

The report claims the smuggling not only deprived the Central Bank of Libya of crucial dollar revenues, it also undermined the integrity of the NOC, whose hydrocarbon exports account for virtually all of Libya’s income.

The vast increase in fuel imports occurred during the NOC chairmanship of Farhat Bengdara who left his position in January after 30 months in charge, the report said.

The NOC has said it abandoned the swap system in March 2025, and the quality of fuel imported from January to September fell by 8% compared with the previous year. But experts say Libya is still importing far more fuel than it could possibly need.

Bengdara told Sentry that under his tenure, the NOC remained transparent and proactive in its cooperation with national institutions and international organisations. He said he had submitted reforms to the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Council for Energy Affairs to reduce reliance on subsidised diesel in electricity generation.

These proposals, Bengdara added, included increasing natural gas production, promoting gas and renewable energy for electricity generation, and initiating the gradual removal of fuel subsidies.",2025-11-14T17:32:02.066612

A letter seen by the Guardian, sent from the company’s subsidiary in Zambia to the country’s government ministers, asks for plans to ban tobacco advertising and sponsorship to be abandoned or delayed.

The tobacco firm seeks changes to a draft bill that include reductions in the proposed size of graphic health warnings on cigarette packaging, the removal of restrictions on flavoured tobacco products, and watered-down penalties for any firms breaking the new laws.

“If I was a politician, I would say that they permit the protection of the British people and perpetuate the death of the Zambian people,” said Master Chimbala, a Zambian anti-tobacco campaigner.

More than 7,000 Zambians a year die from tobacco-related illnesses, according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates.

Chimbala said the letter was understood to have been copied to several government departments and was in circulation among civil society groups.

It comes amid wider concerns about industry interference with health policies. Last month, WHO officials issued a warning that the tobacco industry was intensifying efforts to weaken global control measures.

Jorge Alday, director of the tobacco industry watchdog STOP at health organisation Vital Strategies, said: “We see evidence of industry lobbying everywhere. Tobacco company fingerprints are on delayed tax increases in Indonesia, stalled legislation in Zambia and even a weakened declaration at the UN high-level meeting on NCDs.

“If a tobacco control measure isn’t passed because of this letter, the price could be paid in lives of people who might otherwise quit smoking.”

The tobacco control bill going through Zambia’s parliament includes proposals to go further than UK legislation by also applying to e-cigarettes, and mandating that graphic health warnings cover 75% of product packaging.

In the letter, BAT suggests this be reduced to 30% or 50% “within the WHO-FCTC [Framework Convention on Tobacco Control] recommended threshold”, delayed for at least 12 months after the bill passes.

The WHO in fact recommends a warning should cover at least 50% of the front of a pack “and aim to cover as much of the principal display areas as possible”. In the UK, warnings must cover 65% of a packet’s front and back.

BAT asks for the removal of broad restrictions on flavoured tobacco products, suggesting that it would push consumers toward “illegally traded” products. It suggests prohibiting a smaller list of “flavours based on desserts, candy, energy drinks, soft drinks and alcohol drinks”. All flavoured cigarettes have been banned in the UK since 2020.

The draft bill suggests penalties for various offences “ranging from a percentage of annual turnover to 10 years’ imprisonment”.

In the letter, Mukubesa Maliande, managing director of British American Tobacco (Zambia) plc, says the firm is “committed to good corporate behaviour” and “supports the objectives of governments to reduce smoking incidence and the associated health impact” but claims that “some regulations can have unwelcome and unexpected consequences.”

Chimbala said BAT’s proposed changes would “weaken this legislation so much that the impact needed for it to cause long-term change in society will not be achieved”.

The fact that many such provisions existed in the UK, where BAT is headquartered, was “utter hypocrisy itself”, he said.

“We live in a global village. If I plant tobacco in my back yard and harvest that and sell it out – and my children do not consume tobacco, but my neighbour’s children do … to enrich myself and all the generations of my children while my neighbour’s children are dying … is in itself total emotional, moral and spiritual bankruptcy.”

Tobacco control legislation in the UK or elsewhere had not caused companies to close, Chimbala said. “Legislation never shuts down the industry. It only protects the people.”

A BAT Zambia spokesperson said: “BAT Zambia conducts its business in compliance with applicable local laws. Further, the company participates in the country’s legislative process in line with the relevant frameworks which provide for stakeholder participation in policymaking.”

The company was “not opposed to regulation”, they said, adding that underage people should be protected from access to tobacco and nicotine.

“We advocate for progressive regulation to achieve intended public health goals, while acknowledging the spectrum of rights and obligations on industry, consumers and related stakeholders,” they said, adding that BAT’s proposals “reflect the realities of the Zambian market and tobacco industry, which includes rising levels of illicit trade”.

The move, which will mean Sansal can be transferred to Germany for medical treatment, comes after the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, urged Algeria to free Sansal.

“The president of the republic decided to respond positively to the request of the esteemed president of the friendly Federal Republic of Germany,” said the Algerian statement, issued on Wednesday.

The Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, had previously rejected French requests for Sansal to be pardoned due to his old age and health condition. Sansal, 81, suffers from prostate cancer.

A vocal critic of the Algerian regime, Sansal was arrested at Algiers airport in November last year and sentenced to five years in prison in March, on charges of undermining national unity. His arrest came shortly after commenting in an interview that France had unfairly ceded Moroccan territory to Algeria during the colonial era.

Relations between Paris and Algiers have deteriorated sharply since Macron backed Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara in 2024, and there have been suggestions that the writer was being held a political hostage due to deteriorating relations between the two countries.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, went as far as saying that Algeria was “dishonouring” itself in imprisoning the writer.

By releasing Sansal to Germany, the Algerian government has found a way out of the diplomatic standoff with its former coloniser without losing political face. Tebboune himself was treated at a hospital in Germany after falling ill with Covid-19 in 2020.

On Monday, Steinmeier said that pardoning Sansal would be “an expression of humanitarian sentiment and political foresight”, that would reflect his “years-long personal relationship to president Tebboune and the good relations between our countries”.

That idea – of sprawling projects that transform nations, has influenced both his narrative as an economist turned politician and his government’s multibillion-dollar investment spree. “It’s time to get back at it, and get on with it,” he said in September.

On Thursday, Carney touted a slate of new “nation-building” projects, totalling more than $C56bn (US$40bn) in new investment, that his government will help fast-track in order “to boost Canada’s competitiveness”. But those plans, which include mines and natural gas export, heavily favour investment in a resource-based economy that falls short on projects that experts say could change the day-to-day lives of Canadians – and reimagine the country’s future.

Carney told reporters the projects were “transformational” and will help the country realize “full potential as an energy superpower” while also finding new markets outside the United States.

Carney made the announcement in Terrace, British Columbia, at the site of a proposed C$6bn, 280-mile power line.

The line is meant to secure tens of billions of dollars in private-sector investments, including a string of critical-mineral mines, for the sparsely developed north-west corner of the province. The federal government’s hope is that it fends off economic threats from Donald Trump whose trade war with one of his closest allies has threatened to plunge the Canadian economy into a recession.

The first batch of five projects were announced in September and included critical mineral mines and natural gas projects.

In addition to the power line, Carney also flagged a BC LNG project, a nickel project in Ontario, a mine in New Brunswick, a graphite battery project in Quebec and a hydroelectric project in Iqaluit. He also announced a “conservation corridor” between north-west BC and the Yukon territory roughly the size of Greece.

“The signal the government is sending is that Canada is a resource economy and that we will continue to invest in being a resource economy. It really signals the government’s view that Canada’s strength in the world is its ability to sell those resources,” said Shoshanna Saxe, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Toronto. “And I don’t think that’s wrong. But it feels as though there’s a chance for the government to invest in a new and forward-looking version of Canada.”

The latest list of projects again omits any new oil pipelines, which have proven to be deeply divisive and politically fractious in recent years.

Also absent is a proposed tunnel under the country’s busiest highway which had been pitched by the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, but was dismissed by critics as fantasy. Ford’s provincial government is spending C$9m to study how the tunnel might one day be built.

Pipeline expansion and the tunnel project could have scored Carney political points in Alberta and Ontario, but they would probably take far longer than the 2030 deadline the federal government has put in place.

“If you want to do things fast, you need to go after projects that are already under way and have reasonably fast returns. Most heavy infrastructure can’t be built really quickly, but you can do a lot of light infrastructure projects with speed,” said Saxe. “And these make sense as an economic play – especially given the uncertainty in future relationships with the United States.”

But Saxe said there could be a broader discussion of “what is possible” when it comes to investments from the federal government.

“You could imagine a government that sees the narrative of a sovereignty threat and the need to be fully independent,” she said. And they could say: “We won’t be dependent on the old way of doing things and so we’re going to rapidly invest in new ways of doing things that improve people’s day-to-day lives.”

She pointed to a “huge infrastructure deficit” when it comes to water systems, bridges, public transit and housing.

“There are light things we can do that we could do at scale on a national level. And it would require the movement and engagement that we imagine occurred in the postwar period and after the Depression,” she said. “And at the moment, the federal government is not asking us to engage in changing the basic way Canada works. They’re saying we’re going to continue to invest in the old strengths of Canada. But you’re still left wondering what is possible.”",2025-11-14T17:32:08.247503

Speaking to CNN outside the Miraflores presidential palace in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, Maduro called on Trump to make peace, not war, after the world’s largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R Ford, arrived in the region.

“No more forever wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan. Long live peace,” Maduro, 62, declared late on Thursday as he pushed his way through crowds to reach a pro-government rally.

Hours after the Venezuelan leader spoke, Hegseth sought to pile further pressure on Venezuela’s leader, announcing what he called Operation Southern Spear.

“The Western Hemisphere is America’s neighborhood – and we will protect it,” Hegseth tweeted. He said the Southern Command mission would defend “our homeland” and secure it from “the drugs that are killing our people”.

It is unclear why Hegseth made the announcement now, 10 months after the US Naval Forces Southern Command declared the impending launch of the operation, which it said would use “a heterogeneous mix of robotic and autonomous systems to support the detection and monitoring of illicit trafficking” in the Caribbean.

Hegseth’s comments could perhaps have been a headline-grabbing effort to rebrand Trump’s pressure campaign against Maduro, which has involved a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean and Pacific.

Officially, the massive US deployment is part of the Trump administration’s “war on drugs” and designed to stop Latin America drug cartels “flooding” the US with cocaine and fentanyl.

But Venezuela is not a cocaine producer – that work is done almost entirely in Bolivia, Colombia and Peru – nor is it part of the fentanyl smuggling network, which is focused on Mexico.

As a result, many observers have come to see Trump’s deployment – the largest in the region since the 1989 invasion of Panama – as a political crusade devised to achieve something the US president failed to do during his first term: overthrow Maduro.

CBS News reported this week that senior military officials had handed Trump “options for potential operations in Venezuela, including strikes on land”, although two sources insisted no final decision had been made.

Venezuela’s foreign minister, Yván Gil, sent a defiant message to “the North American empire”. “Don’t you dare [attack]. We are ready,” he said.

Amid growing speculation that an aerial attack on Venezuelan soil was imminent, Reuters said Maduro’s regime had drawn up plans for “a guerrilla-style response” to any US assault.

Those plans reportedly envisage “small military units at more than 280 locations carrying out acts of sabotage and other guerrilla tactics” to repel foreign fighters.

Under a second strategy, described as “anarchisation”, pro-regime groups including the intelligence services would sow chaos on the streets of Caracas “and make Venezuela ungovernable for foreign forces”, two sources told Reuters.",2025-11-14T17:32:10.073615

The high court in London on Friday, Mrs Justice O’Farrell ruled that BHP was responsible for the collapse of the Fundão dam in Mariana despite not owning the dam at the time.

The collapse, which led to Brazil’s worst environmental disaster, unleashed tonnes of toxic waste into a major river, killing 19 people and devastating villages downstream.



In a judgment of more than 200 pages, O’Farrell said the risk of collapse of the dam “was foreseeable” and there had been “obvious signs of contractive, saturated tailings and numerous incidents of seepage and cracking”. She added that it “could have been averted”.

The ruling brings about 600,000 Brazilians a step closer to securing compensation of about £36bn. It addressed only the legal liability for the disaster. A second phase of the trial will determine damages.

The Australia-based BHP, which is also listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it intended to appeal against the decision and would continue to defend against the UK group action.

BHP owns 50% of Samarco, the Brazilian company that operates the iron ore mine where the tailings dam ruptured on 5 November 2015, releasing more than 40m cubic metres of mining waste into the Doce River in south-eastern Brazil.

Sludge from the burst dam destroyed the village of Bento Rodrigues in Minas Gerais state and badly damaged other towns. The disaster also killed 14 tonnes of freshwater fish and damaged 370 miles (600km) of the Doce River, according to a study by the Ulster University in the UK. The river, which the Krenak Indigenous people revere as a deity, has yet to recover.

The trial, which began in October last year, was filed in Britain because one of BHP’s two main legal entities was based in London at the time. It began only days before Brazil’s federal government reached a multibillion-dollar settlement with the mining companies.

Under the agreement, Samarco, which is also half owned by the Brazilian mining company Vale, agreed to pay 132bn reais (£19bn) over 20 years. The payments were meant to compensate for human, environmental and infrastructure damage.

BHP had said the UK legal action was unnecessary because it duplicated matters covered by legal proceedings in Brazil.

The proposed Fossil Fuel Treaty is already backed by 17 countries and advocates in Belem said that countries needed to hurry up and act on the root cause of the climate crisis. In 2023, the Cop in Dubai resulted in countries vowing to “transition away” from fossil fuels, although there is little evidence of this happening as yet. “If we continue to extract hydrocarbons from the Earth, we will exterminate ourselves,” said Olivia Bissa, president of the Chapra Nation in the Peruvian Amazon. “We worry what will happen if we don’t have concrete action now. We as indigenous people in the Amazon are tired of being sacrificed by a group of powerful people who want to rule the planet. If we don’t do something together we will be complicit with ecocide and the assassination of humanity.” Activists from the Fossil Fuel Treaty at Cop30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on 13 November 2025 Photograph: Oliver Milman/The Guardian Tzeporah Berman, chair of the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, praised Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for urging a fossil fuel phase out but criticized the Brazilian president for allowing a new oil drilling project near the mouth of the Amazon, pointing to a recent International Court of Justice ruling that demands countries address the climate crisis. “We know fossil fuel production continues to rise, pushing the world past planetary limits and deepening inequality,” said Berman, singling out the US, Australia, Norway and Canada for ramping up oil and gas drilling since the Paris agreement a decade ago. A treaty to end all this would be a “major act of love and justice for our time,” she added. Given the format of this Cop, and pushback that is already happening from Saudi Arabia and other big oil producers, it’s unclear what, if any, language on fossil fuel phase out will be included in this year’s agreement. A major opponent of any such pact would be Donald Trump, who has called for the US, and the rest of the world, to “drill, baby, drill.” Crystal Cavalier, a Native American woman from North Carolina, is at Cop30, unlike the US government, and said a new treaty would at least put international pressure on the US to kick its fossil fuel habit. “We are being targeted in sacrifice zones that are pushing our ecosystems to the brink,” she said. “Our current government is aggressively rolling back environmental protections. “The Fossil Fuel treaty can be a tool, a pressure point that frontline communities can wield when their governments avoid accountability. We need external pressure in the US, we can’t do this alone. The US isn’t showing up, but the rest of the world can show up for us.” Share Updated at 17.33 GMT

21h ago 19.57 GMT 'Completely immature' - Paris agreement architect on US global standing Dharna Noor View image in fullscreen Christiana Figueres. Photograph: Dharna Noor/The Guardian “The United States has lost credibility” on the international stage, Christiana Figueres, the mother of the Paris Agreement, told me on Thursday. The Trump administration is treating multilateral politics like “two and three year olds” who cause a ruckus while “playing house,” she said. “It is completely immature, irresponsible, and very sad for the United States,” she said. Donald Trump chose not to send an official delegation to the Cop negotiations this year – a first for the US – after pulling the country from the Paris Agreement on his first day in office this past January. But Americans are still very much involved in Cop30 goings-on, said Figureres, who earlier this week moderated a conversation with California governor Gavin Newsom, the topmost US official at Cop. View image in fullscreen California Governor Gavin Newsom with Christiana Figueres. Photograph: Fernando Llano/AP “There are many forces of the United States that are representing the fact that everybody understands that climate is undeniable, but more importantly, that those forces understand that there is a huge social and economic business opportunity in addressing climate change,” she said. In interviews with the Guardian, some delegates expressed concern that Trump could try to impede the negotiations by using backdoor bullying tactics or via private dealings with allies such as Saudi Arabia. I asked Figueres about these worries. “Is the United States administration working here through other countries? Maybe likely, let’s see,” she said. “For the time being, no bomb has been dropped.” Right now, a hot button issue in the negotiations is the phaseout of fossil fuels. At Cop28, nearly 200 countries agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels” for the first time. Though some countries are backing the inclusion of a “roadmap” for coal, oil, and gas phaseout in this year’s agreement, some oil producers are pushing back. “The word of choice of the moment is ‘road map,’” said Figueres with a smile, noting ahead of these negotiations, officials also worked to create a roadmap to secure climate finance. But whether or not language on the transition off of fossil fuels materializes in Brazil, the transition is happening in the real world, said Figueres. “We have to understand that we have both a political sphere and we have an economic sphere,” she said. “Whatever documents come out of the political sphere are important for that political reality, and that is definitely important, [but] there is also economic reality that is moving forward independently.” There are signs that fossil fuel producers are grappling with the wind down of coal, oil, and gas, said Figueres. As those companies have reaped unexpectedly high profits after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, they have not used those monies to expand extraction. Instead, they have paid higher dividends to their shareholders and worked to decrease their debts. “They understand that they are no longer competitive, and I believe that they’re getting ready for the demise of the industry,” she said. Figueres was pleased that Cop30 is being held in Belem. The city is nestled into the Amazon rainforest, which is teetering on the edge of a climate tipping point. “It is very symbolic, it’s very important that it is here, because it reminds us first, that we have these tipping points in front of us [and] that forests and Indigenous rights need to be front and center,” she said.

21h ago 19.32 GMT Over in the US, Nancy Pelosi, a senior Democrat and former Speaker, has “sounded the alarm on America’s absence from Cop30”. She said the lack of American presence was not just because of the government shutdown, but also blamed Republicans for not cooperating to send a bipartisan delegation to Brazil. President Donald Trump has pulled the US out of global climate diplomacy, but his administration has actively opposed action to tackle pollution in other global fora. This morning, I stood with my Democratic @SEEC colleagues to sound the alarm on America’s absence from COP30.

22h ago 18.31 GMT The reality of climate breakdown depends on where you live. Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a Quechua-speaking farmer in the Andean highlands who I met in a courtroom in German earlier this year, is living through one extreme example of this. Here is his story, as told to Fernanda Solorza. View image in fullscreen Saul Luciano Lliuya. Photograph: Angela Ponce/Reuters I was born on a farm in Huaraz Independencia, at an altitude of 3,100 metres. From Huaraz, you can see the mountains. The mountains are up to 6,000 metres high. There’s a snowcapped mountain that can be seen quite close from the farm. It’s called Nevado Churup. I live in the highlands, near the mountains. I’m the son of small farmers. I’m a farmer and a mountain guide. The fields aren’t easy. Everything is manual, but little by little you adapt. The geography is different: there are slopes here. There are ups and downs. It’s muddy when it rains. It’s very hot when it doesn’t, and there’s plenty of sun. But when you harvest as a child, you already begin to taste the first fruits. Corn, sugar cane, and tender broad beans. You begin to enjoy the countryside. We have cows in the mountains, in the ravine, here in Quilcayhuanca. You go twice a month, depending on whether the cows are pregnant or not. When they get pregnant, we have to take them out of the ravine because it’s dangerous. A condor or a fox could eat them. The ravine is roughly a 13- to 12-hour walk there and back. It’s a great challenge to go to the mountains from home. I used to go with my sisters, starting when I was eight or 10 years old. The ravine was different than it is now. I remember there were many more wetlands, it had more life. There were more ducks, other birds, which you don’t see now. I remember birds flying almost like they were in the sea. There was also more grass, there were more waterfalls. Now it’s different. There’s less grass, fewer waterfalls. I remember that when we approached the mountain, I used to see a lot of deer, taruca. Now you don’t see much. There are some, but not as many as before. The glacier is slowly melting. It’s clearly visible when you’re on the mountain. There are people who live in the city and haven’t visited the mountains. They’ve never been close. As a farmer and as a mountain guide, when you reach a snowy peak and return the following year, and years go by, it impacts you. It makes you feel sorry for the mountains. You feel sad about what’s happening, and it creates a feeling of helplessness, of not being able to do anything about it. If someone has an illness, you treat it, but unfortunately, the mountain can’t be treated. You can’t do anything. With the passing of time and the melting of glaciers, lagoons have started to form, and the authorities and experts say it’s very dangerous. In the year 1941, the upper part of an avalanche fell into the Palcacocha lagoon and overflowed, causing a mudslide, killing many people. Some say 18,000, others 20,000. Sometimes there were years when it rained heavily, the rivers were full, you could hear them carrying rocks, and I remember my sister and I would get scared. The neighbours were also scared, and they would say: “That lake burst its banks once and killed a lot of people. We hope the lake doesn’t burst again.” ‘The glacier is slowly melting, it’s clearly visible’ – This is climate breakdown Read more Share

23h ago 17.40 GMT Dharna Noor Thousands of media professionals are at the United Nations climate talks in Brazil. Almost none of them appear to be from the four major US broadcasters, my colleagues Dharna Noor and Jonathan Watts write from Belém. Nearly 4,000 members of the media registered to attend the global climate conference, known as Cop30, according to a preliminary list released by the United Nations climate body on Tuesday. But none of the “big four” US broadcasters – CBS, NBC, ABC, and Fox – appear to currently have teams present at the talks. According to the list, no representatives from CBS, NBC, or Fox signed up to attend the talks. Two US staffers from ABC signed up to attend, and though they are reporting on the summit, it is unclear if they are in Brazil. The big four television outlets also appear not to be covering the climate negotiations in a significant way. In a review of TV coverage of Cop30 shared exclusively with the Guardian, the non-profit Media Matters found that weekday morning and evening national news shows on ABC, CBS, and NBC had not covered Cop30 from 6 November through 11 November. Fox News aired two segments that totalled roughly five minutes of coverage, one of which promoted “anti-climate narratives”, Media Matters said. The Guardian has contacted all four major broadcasters for comment. It’s “unimaginable” that major western broadcasters would choose to sit out the talks, said Stefano Wrobleski, director of InfoAmazonia, a non-profit independent media outlet focused on the Amazonian region. “I can’t see how or why an outlet with funds would choose not to come to Brazil for this,” he said. “We are here and we have a much smaller budget than the big outlets in the US.” Major US broadcasters sit out Cop30 climate talks: ‘They’re missing a lot’ Read more Share

23h ago 17.12 GMT Ajit Niranjan As European negotiators in Belém urge countries to raise their climate ambitions, their politicians at home have voted to lower their own. The European Parliament voted on Thursday to cut planet-heating pollution by 90% by 2040 from 1990 levels and allow 5% of that to come from foreign carbon credits – a landmark plan that falls short of what its scientific advisors recommend. MEPs in Strasbourg earlier today also backed proposals to weaken a delayed law to stop deforestation in supply chains and to restrict the scope of corporate green rules. European countries are some of the biggest historical polluters of greenhouse gas but have long championed stronger action at UN climate summits. Yet in the last two years, the EU and many of its member states have begun to roll back and “simplify” ambitious climate policies under the banner of increasing the bloc’s competitiveness. View image in fullscreen A German wind turbine and power pylons obscured by fumes from a coal-fired power plant. Photograph: Ina Fassbender/AFP/Getty Images The EU’s 2040 target with room for carbon credits – a compromise solution that won over climate ministers last week, just in time for Cop30 – is among the most ambitious interim targets of any major polluter. But it falls short of the 90-95% domestic cuts recommended by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change. Green campaigners were also angered by the vote to weaken the EU’s corporate sustainability rules – the first of several “omnibus” deregulation packages – which removes an obligation on companies to create climate transition plans. The requirement would have forced companies to explain how they plan to align their business practices with the Paris Agreement, which seeks to limit global heating to 1.5C (2.7F). To obtain a majority in the Parliament’s plenary, the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) voted with far-right parties that pro-EU centrists have traditionally shunned. “While the world looks to Cop30, the EPP banded with the far right to make sure business actors no longer have to create and adhere to climate transition plans,” said Frances Verkamp, a corporate accountability campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe. “They betrayed their own promises by ignoring several moderate centre-left proposals,” she added. “If this is the dynamic, the centre-far right alliance on the next deregulation omnibuses will bulldoze protections for citizens and the environment.” The positions adopted today will be negotiated with member states and the European Commission before final versions of the laws come into force.

Cop meetings usually wildly overrun as decisions on difficult issues are pushed to the brink. “We are positive and optimistic that we’ll be able to conclude on time, or with a very short delay, maybe five minutes, 10 minutes, on [Friday] 21st,” said Liliam Chagas, director for climate at Brazil’s foreign affairs ministry, on Wednesday.

Haggling over what issues go on the agenda often pushes the actual start of negotiations into day two. Brazil solved this by hiking off tricky issues, like finance and fossil fuels, into consultations, which are still ongoing. Cop president André Corrêa do Lago was also optimistic: “I am hoping that we’re going to end on the 21st – we will try hard. I think that we have some [good] indications. This is a [country]-driven process, and the countries have been very constructive. We’re having a very good mood among them.” “There is a strong indication that everybody that is here wants to show the world that multilateralism works and that we’re all together to prove that,” he said.

In his annual speech on threats facing Canada, Dan Rogers, director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), flagged mounting concerns over hostile nations growing increasingly emboldened in the Arctic.

“It is not a surprise that CSIS has observed both cyber and non-cyber intelligence collection efforts targeting both governments and the private sector in the region,” he said on Thursday.

Canada has increasingly flagged the navigable routes that pass through the country’s borders and the troves of critical minerals in the region as reason to increase investment in the north. In addition to new heavy ice breakers, Canada is weighing the purchase of a dozen patrol submarines.

In the federal budget unveiled last week, Canada announced a C$1bn (US$710m) Arctic infrastructure fund to help build new airports, seaports and all-season roads.

Anita Anand, Canada’s foreign affairs minister, told reporters last week the Nato military alliance should devote effort to the Arctic, adding it “must be an organization not only that focuses on the eastern flank, but also that looks north”.

In his speech, Rogers also said CSIS agents foiled attempts by Russia to illegally acquire Canadian goods and technologies for use in its war against Ukraine.

“This year, CSIS took action to prevent this by informing several Canadian companies that Europe-based front companies seeking to acquire their goods were in fact connected to Russian agents,” he said, adding that the companies took immediate measures to deny the Russians.

He also said that Chinese spies “have tried to recruit Canadians with information and military expertise”.

In addition to threats from China and Russia, Rogers said the agency foiled potentially lethal threats by Iran directed against dissidents.

His remarks are the first public confirmation that the agency has intervened to protect Canada-based critics of Tehran. CSIS had said previously it was investigating Iranian threats, but did not mention specific threats.

“In particularly alarming cases over the last year, we’ve had to reprioritize our operations to counter the actions of Iranian intelligence services and their proxies who have targeted individuals they perceive as threats to their regime,” Rogers said.

“In more than one case, this involved detecting, investigating, and disrupting potentially lethal threats against individuals in Canada,” he said.

Canada has particularly poor relations with Iran and cut off diplomatic ties in 2012. Last year, Canada listed Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, prompting condemnation from Tehran.

A spokesperson for the ministry of commerce was responding to an interview by Vincent Karremans on Thursday in which he described the standoff between China and the European Union as a “wake-up call” for western leaders.

The spokesperson said: “China has noted the recent remarks made by Dutch minister of economic affairs Karremans in media interviews. China expresses extreme disappointment and strong dissatisfaction with such remarks that confuse right and wrong, distort facts and persist in a single-minded course.

“The profound lesson this semiconductor supply chain crisis has taught the world is that administrative measures should not be used to improperly interfere with corporate operations.”

Beijing imposed a worldwide ban on exports of chips from Nexperia at the start of October, almost bringing the global car industry to a halt.

Its drastic action followed a decision by the Dutch government to take supervisory control of the Chinese-owned company at the end of September citing economic security issues.

In the interview, Karremans said the Dutch government had received intelligence that the Chinese CEO was “moving away intellectual property rights, they were firing people and they were looking to relocate production to China” from its subsidiary factory in Hamburg, Germany.

Nexperia is a subsidiary of Wingtech Technology, a Shanghai-listed company, which bought the Dutch chip maker in 2018.

Karremans said he had no regrets about the steps his government took, saying on the basis of the information he had now, he would do it all over again.

But his actions have infuriated China, which instead of entering a bilateral battle on behalf of Wingtech, ordered a global ban on exports of Nexperia chips which are all finished in China.

The spokesperson for the Chinese ministry described a court decision to suspend the Chinese boss of Nexperia as “erroneous” and blamed the export ban directly on the Dutch.

“This unwise and impulsive act, which violates the spirit of contract, is the root cause of the turmoil and chaos in the global semiconductor supply chain,” it said.

The US-based Anthropic said its coding tool, Claude Code, was “manipulated” by a Chinese state-sponsored group to attack 30 entities around the world in September, achieving a “handful of successful intrusions”.

This was a “significant escalation” from previous AI-enabled attacks it monitored, it wrote in a blogpost on Thursday, because Claude acted largely independently: 80 to 90% of the operations involved in the attack were performed without a human in the loop.

“The actor achieved what we believe is the first documented case of a cyber-attack largely executed without human intervention at scale,” it wrote.

Anthropic did not clarify which financial institutions and government agencies had been targeted, or what exactly the hackers had achieved – although it did say they were able to access their targets’ internal data.

It said Claude had made numerous mistakes in executing the attacks, at times making up facts about its targets, or claiming to have “discovered” information that was free to access.

Policymakers and some experts said the findings were an unsettling sign of how capable certain AI systems have grown: tools such as Claude are now able to work independently over longer periods of time.

“Wake the f up. This is going to destroy us – sooner than we think – if we don’t make AI regulation a national priority tomorrow,” the US senator Chris Murphy wrote on X in response to the findings.

“AI systems can now perform tasks that previously required skilled human operators,” said Fred Heiding, a computing security researcher at Harvard University. “It’s getting so easy for attackers to cause real damage. The AI companies don’t take enough responsibility.”

Other cybersecurity experts were more sceptical, pointing to inflated claims about AI-fuelled cyber-attacks in recent years – such as an AI-powered “password cracker” from 2023 that performed no better than conventional methods – and suggesting Anthropic was trying to create hype around AI.

“To me, Anthropic is describing fancy automation, nothing else,” said Michal Wozniak, an independent cybersecurity expert. “Code generation is involved, but that’s not ‘intelligence’, that’s just spicy copy-paste.”

Wozniak said Anthropic’s release was a distraction from a bigger cybersecurity concern: businesses and governments integrating “complex, poorly understood” AI tools into their operations without understanding them, exposing them to vulnerabilities. The real threat, he said, were cybercriminals themselves – and lax cybersecurity practices.

Anthropic, like all leading AI companies, has guardrails that are supposed to stop its models from assisting in cyber-attacks – or promoting harm generally. However, it said, the hackers were able to subvert these guardrails by telling Claude to role-play being an “employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm” conducting tests.

Wozniak said: “Anthropic’s valuation is at around $180bn, and they still can’t figure out how not to have their tools subverted by a tactic a 13-year-old uses when they want to prank-call someone.”

Marius Hobbhahn, the founder of Apollo Research, a company that evaluates AI models for safety, said the attacks were a sign of what could come as capabilities grow.

“I think society is not well prepared for this kind of rapidly changing landscape in terms of AI and cyber capabilities. I would expect many more similar events to happen in the coming years, plausibly with larger consequences.”",2025-11-14T17:32:19.797675

The FTSE 100 fell by 1.1% in London, closing down about 100 points at 9,698, as bellwether banking stocks tumbled. Barclays, Lloyds and NatWest slumped by between 2.7% and 3.6%.

On Wednesday, the blue-chip index had threatened to break through the landmark 10,000-point mark for the first time. Meanwhile, the pound fell against the dollar after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, abandoned plans to raise income tax rates in the budget.

US markets came under fresh pressure on Friday, before pulling back. The benchmark S&P 500 started the day lower in New York, but by late morning was trading flat, while the Dow Jones industrial average declined 0.8%.

The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite fell by as much as 1.8%, but then recovered its losses to break out of the red.

Markets across Europe also fell on opening, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 falling 0.9%.

France’s Cac 40 has so far fallen 0.54%, while Germany’s Dax dropped by almost 0.9%.

Japan’s tech-heavy Nikkei fell 1.8% on Friday, South Korea’s Kospi plunged 2.6% and there was a 1.5% fall in Australia, after a torrid day on Wall Street as Nvidia and other tech companies tumbled over valuation concerns.

Nvidia, the $4.5tn (£3.4tn) tech company, led a wider sector decline, falling 3.6% as investors reassessed the value of businesses involved in the AI sector after Japan’s SoftBank sold its entire stake in the company.

SoftBank and SK Hynix, a Chinese chipmaker for mobiles and computers, fell more than 6%, Samsung Electronics dropped 4% and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company dropped 1.8%.

Global markets also reacted to fears of a slowdown in the Chinese economy after data showed that activity cooled more than expected at the start of the final quarter of the year.

Figures showed that fixed-asset investment shrank 1.7% in the first 10 months, a record decline, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

China’s CSI 300 fell 0.7%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.9% and Taiwan’s Taiex slumped by 1.4%.

US markets were also jittery over the impact on the economy of the world’s largest market over the longest federal government shutdown in history.

The shutdown has forced the government to put the release of data on inflation and jobs on hold.

A growing number of officials have also signalled caution over the prospects of a US rate cut next month.

Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: “It’s certainly been a volatile week in terms of sentiment, with relief over the end of the shutdown vying with concerns over AI valuations and whether the Fed will cut rates again after several speakers have struck a more cautious tone this week.

“The S&P 500 posted its worst day in over a month with a December cut probability falling sharply from about 59% at Wednesday’s close to 49% last night.”

Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, said: “The weakness in Asian markets wasn’t quite as profound as what was experienced on Wall Street. It stands to reason. There’s more air in US valuations and the locus of the sell-off is a combination of dialled back Fed rate cut expectations and a loss of momentum behind the AI trade amid fears of inadequate return on investment.

“But there was still a high degree of sluggishness in Asian risk assets, notwithstanding a brief pop in Chinese stocks after underwhelming data, including extraordinarily weak investment figures, raised hopes of more stimulus from Chinese authorities.”

The Guardian and Carbon Brief analysed previously unreported submissions to the UN, along with data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), that show how billions of dollars of public money is being committed to the fight against global heating.

The investigation found a broadly functioning system that shifts capital from rich polluters to vulnerable nations, helping them clean their economies and adapt to a hotter world.

But it also found that because the distribution of the largest part of the funds had no central oversight and was entirely at the discretion of individual countries, it was subject to political interests and not always directed where it was most needed.

Although official data is not extensive enough to trace all the recipients of climate finance, the Guardian analysis found that about a fifth of the funding in 2021 and 2022 went to the world’s 44 poorest countries, known as the least developed countries (LDCs). Much of that was in the form of loans, rather than grants.

Some LDCs received more than two-thirds of their climate finance in the form of loans, whose repayment terms can push governments further into debt traps. The share of loans rose to 95% or more in the cases of Bangladesh and Angola.

Most of the world’s developed countries provide finance to support climate action in developing ones, bilaterally and through multilateral organisations such as development banks. At a UN summit in Copenhagen in 2009, rich countries promised to mobilise $100bn (£76bn) a year by 2020 in recognition of their greater responsibility for climate breakdown and ability to fund solutions.

But the analysis of the most recent submissions, covering more than 20,000 global projects during 2021 and 2022 – the year in which the Copenhagen target was belatedly met, found that vast sums were going to petrostates, as well as to China, the world’s second-largest economy.

UAE, a fossil fuel exporter with a GDP per capita on a par with France and Canada, received more than $1bn in loans from Japan that were logged as climate finance. The projects include $625m for an offshore electricity transmission project in Abu Dhabi and $452m for a waste incinerator in Dubai.

Saudi Arabia, which is one of the top 10 carbon emitters thanks to its giant oilfields and majority-ownership of Aramco, received about $328m in Japanese loans, including $250m to its electricity company and $78m for a solar farm.

Six countries in the Balkans that hope to join the EU received more than $3.5bn in climate finance. The bulk of the money went to Serbia, which on a per capita basis received 10 times more money than the LDCs.

European recipients of climate finance included an EU member state, Romania, which received an $8m grant from the US for an engineering study to build a small modular nuclear reactor.

Joe Thwaites, a climate finance advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said overall flows of climate finance were increasing but “not enough” was getting to the poorest and most vulnerable communities, with debt-distressed countries needing more grants and concessional loans.

“This is not charity,” he said. “It is a strategic investment that addresses the root causes of many of the crises we see daily: cost of living, supply chain disruptions, natural disasters, forced migration and conflict.”

Over the two years under consideration, about $33bn was committed to the LDCs, which include Haiti, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Yemen.

A much larger sum of money – about $98bn – went to developing countries, a broader group that includes lower middle-income countries such as India and upper middle-income countries such as China. Another $32bn could not be classified. India was the single largest recipient of finance over the reporting period, receiving about $14bn, while China received $3bn, mostly from multilateral banks.

The analysis suggests the underrepresentation of the LDCs reflects their smaller population size, but the makeup of the developing country group is a growing source of tension at climate negotiations.

China’s economy, for instance, has boomed since the UN classified it as developing in the 1990s, and its emissions have surpassed European levels on a per capita basis. China is thought to be a significant provider of finance to foreign climate projects but has resisted efforts to formally count its contributions. The UN’s development categories have not changed since they were drawn up in 1992.

“That allows countries such as Israel, Korea, Qatar, Singapore and UAE – all of which have become wealthy nations with large carbon footprints over the last 30 years – to shirk their international responsibilities,” said Sarah Colenbrander, climate director at the Overseas Development Institute. “It is absurd that such nations remain in the same category as countries like Togo, Tonga and Tanzania.”

Some of the world’s poorest countries receive more than two-thirds of their climate finance in the form of loans, despite warnings that many cannot afford the terms and interest repayments.

“The hidden story of climate finance is not in the volume of commitments, but in their forms,” said Ritu Bharadwaj, climate finance director at the International Institute for Environment and Development.

“Climate finance is increasing the financial burden on poorer nations. Even if the money donated is a concessional loan, those loans do also come with conditions which might benefit the lender more than the recipient.”

Data from the World Bank shows that over the same period, LDCs have together repaid almost $91.3bn in external debts – three times their climate finance budgets. Over the past decade, repayments of external debts of the poorest nations have trebled, from $14.3bn in 2012 to $46.5bn in 2022.

“Conventional thinking is that taking on more debt isn’t bad if it is being used to fund growth-enhancing expenditure,” said Shakira Mustapha, a finance expert at the Centre for Disaster Protection. “My concern is whether countries are just taking on new debt to repay old debt and we are just kicking the can down the road.”

The foreign ministries of China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and UAE did not respond to a request for comment.

Q&A Methodology Show The Guardian and Carbon Brief analysis on climate finance includes the bilateral and multilateral public funding that developed nations have committed for climate projects in developing countries. The analysis excludes other types of funding that contribute to the $100bn target for climate projects such as private donations and export credits. Data for the multilateral funding comes from the OECD. The bilateral funding comes from the Biennial Transparency Report each country submits to the UN framework convention on climate change. Due to the lag in official reporting, the most recent figures go up only to 2022. As only annex II countries (23 industrialised nations and the EU) are responsible for contributing to the $100bn target, the analysis of the bilateral files was restricted to these nations. Likewise, using OECD methodology, we calculated the share of multilateral climate finance which is attributable to this group. We also calculated the shares of multilateral finance that can be attributed to individual donor countries, based on shareholdings in multilateral development banks and cumulative contributions to multilateral climate funds. This is based on a methodology that has been used by analysts at the World Resources Institute and ODI. The analysis classified the recipients of the bilateral projects using the UN country classification. But many projects remain unclassified because the recipients are not specified, are reported as “multi-country”, or are part of a group of countries for which the funding cannot be disaggregated. These projects have not been included when calculating the amount of finance that individual developing countries received, but they are included in the total figures. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

A spokesperson for UN Climate Change said: “The inequities revealed in climate finance flows highlight why a shift in the global financial system is urgently needed. Treating climate finance as charity has held back the progress the world needs, as has treating it purely as a cost and ignoring the massive human and economic dividends it pays.”

The original $100bn target is being replaced this year with a new target for developed countries to provide $300bn a year by 2035, with a wider goal of mobilising $1.3tn a year. Last week, the heads of the two most recent UN climate summits published a report that explored ways of sustainably raising the cash that included taxes on fossil fuels and climate-resilient debt clauses. It also called for an expansion of concessional and grant-based climate finance.

“Climate finance must be accessible, affordable, and fair,” the UN Climate Change spokesperson said. “The fact that many of the world’s lowest-income countries face barriers and still rely on high-interest loans for climate finance underscores the urgency of reform.”",2025-11-14T17:32:24.904930

Pointing to the bags beneath her eyes, Takaichi told MPs that she survives on minimal sleep – a habit she shares with her political hero Margaret Thatcher – after being asked how she would tackle Japan’s notoriously long working hours.

Takaichi caused a stir last week after she summoned aides to her office for a 3am meeting to prepare for a budget committee hearing that was due to start six hours later, weeks after she celebrated becoming Japan’s first female leader by promising to “work, work, work, work and work”.

“I sleep about two hours now, four hours at the longest,” she told MPs at a legislative committee meeting this week. “It’s probably bad for my skin,”

Japan has struggled to change a corporate culture that expects employees to work long hours, and often socialise with colleagues in the evening.

Punishing hours have been blamed for a rise in karoshi, or death from overwork, and for making it harder for exhausted couples to do their bit to raise the country’s low birthrate.

There is concern that Takaichi expects employees to work longer hours to promote economic growth, as her administration discusses possibly raising a cap on overtime.

She has said that any changes in working conditions would prioritise workers’ health.

“If we can create a situation where people can properly balance childcare and caregiving responsibilities according to their wishes, and also being able to work, enjoy leisure time, and relax – that would be ideal,” she said.

After she was elected president of the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) in early October – a victory that later saw her installed as prime minister – Takaichi said she would dispense with the idea of a “work-life balance for myself”, but also urged her LDP colleagues to “work like a horse”.

Her heavy workload drew expressions of concern from political friends and foes alike. Ken Saito, a former LDP economy minister, said he was “honestly worried” about Takaichi’s health, while Katsuhito Nakajima, an opposition MP, urged her to get more sleep, eliciting a nod and a smile from the prime minister.

She is not alone among Japanese people in failing to get enough sleep, although few of her compatriots can match her maximum four hours a night.

A study released on World Sleep Day in March found that people in Japan average seven 7 hours, 1 minute of sleep on weekdays – 38 minutes shy of the international average and less than people in the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Canada.

Takaichi has, admittedly, had little time to relax since becoming Japan’s first female prime minister at the end of October. She had been in office only a matter of days when she attended an Asean summit in Malaysia, before welcoming Donald Trump for a state visit and meeting Xi Jinping at the Apec summit in South Korea.

A deepening row with China over her recent suggestion that Japan could become militarily involved in a conflict in the Taiwan Strait could give her yet more sleepless nights.",2025-11-14T17:32:26.813305

Video footage shows Johnson Wen jumping over a barricade at Universal Studios Singapore and rushing at Grande on the red carpet. Grande’s co-star Cynthia Erivo immediately jumped in to help protect her and Wen was moved away.

Local media has indicated that Wen, 26, who is an Australian citizen, intends to plead guilty and could be fined up to S$2,000 (£1,168).

Wen regularly posts on Instagram as pyjamamann, where his stock-in-trade is invading concert stages, including those of Katy Perry and the Weeknd. The footage of his approach to Grande led to a substantial backlash, with many commenters calling his actions a criminal offence.

Grande and co-stars are shortly to complete their mammoth publicity tour for the film’s sequel, which is released on 21 November. The review embargo lifts on Tuesday and early reaction has suggested repeat Oscar nominations for the two stars are likely.

Red carpet invasions are increasingly uncommon as security has tightened over recent years. In 2007, podcaster Cielke Sijben handcuffed herself to Hugh Grant at a premiere of his romcom Music and Lyrics. Firefighters later freed the pair.

Bradley Cooper was accosted on the red carpet in 2014 by a Ukrainian TV prankster who buried his head in the actor’s trousers, having given Will Smith an unsolicited kiss at the Moscow premiere of Men in Black 3 in 2012. Also in 2012, Kim Kardashian was flourbombed at the red carpet event for her perfume launch by a Peta activist who called her a “fur hag”.",2025-11-14T17:32:28.642106

“Students are paying the price … students can’t afford to wait years for this reform, we’ve known job ready graduates isn’t working for many years and reform is urgent,” he said.

Between the start of 2021, when JRG was established, and the end of 2024, total Hecs debt grew more than $10bn, according to parliamentary budget office modelling.

On Wednesday, Department of Education officials revealed to a Senate inquiry into university governance that there has been no modelling done on how much it would cost the government to reverse or replace the JRG.

They did not list reform of the JRG in the work the interim Atec has undertaken, and when asked when the department was “planning” for the scheme to be reformed, officials said it would be a “matter for government”.

They also revealed at the time of the hearing that the legislation had not been finalised. “I can say that we have had consultations and we continue the consultations on the drafting,” said Jasmina Joldić, the deputy secretary.

The opposition has raised questions over what the legislated Atec will do.

“There are some immediate questions that spring to mind. What is the problem that Atec solves? Will the establishment of this new body mean that more taxpayer money goes to funding university courses, or less?” said shadow education minister Julian Leeser in a statement to Guardian Australia.

“Universities routinely deal with up to seven different regulatory, funding or oversight bodies already.”

Greens higher education spokesperson, Mehreen Faruqi said the education department could do the work now.

“Labor spoke a big game in opposition about how terrible JRG was, but now in government they have kicked the JRG can down the Atec road as students continue to suffer under mountains of study debt,” she said.

“There is no reason we have to wait for Atec to be up and running to abolish these punitive fee hikes that punish students.”

On Wednesday, the University of Sydney senior deputy vice-chancellor, Prof Annamarie Jagose, told the Senate inquiry that the JRG is having a significant adverse impact on vulnerable communities.

She said the scheme “could be making some of Australia’s most vulnerable student groups, including First Nations, women, and first in family who tend to study humanities in disproportionate amounts put off enrolling in university at all, despite government and university intention for the opposite to occur.”",2025-11-14T17:32:30.316831

The allegation was denied by the chaperone and did not lead to charges. But Victoria’s education department apologised to the mother last year for failing to implement risk mitigation strategies during the police investigation.

The apology came after an investigation by the state’s child safety watchdog – the Commission for Children and Young People (CCYP) – which said the conduct of the school’s principal and assistant principal in response to the allegations “amounted to neglect” of their students’ safety.

Months after making her report to police – and after discovering the chaperone was still doing work at the school – Beth* saw a photo, seen by Guardian Australia, showing her daughter standing next to him at the school.

“My heart sunk. I couldn’t believe that they allowed him access to her,” she said.

Beth told Guardian Australia her daughter, who was 11 at the time, disclosed the alleged sexual assault several years ago. When she was dropped off by the school bus that afternoon, Beth said she noticed her daughter’s pants were sitting low and her underwear was visible.

Beth said she immediately rang the school principal to alert her. She said the principal told her to contact police if she believed something had happened. Beth later reported the alleged incident to her local police station. Her daughter was interviewed by Victoria’s police’s sexual offences and child abuse investigations team (Socit) six days later, using gestures, according to a transcript seen by Guardian Australia.

But for months during the police investigation, the chaperone remained working on the bus and on the school grounds. The buses transport the school’s students to and from the campus each day.

Beth said she was “in disbelief” when she heard the chaperone was still working on the bus while the investigation was ongoing. She said she first learned of this during a conversation with the school’s assistant principal, who she said asked if she wanted her daughter to resume travelling on the bus.

“It felt like [the school] weren’t taking it seriously, and that they didn’t believe that this thing had happened, because they were so willing to just put her back on to the same bus with the same person that she’s accused of doing these things,” Beth said.

More than eight months into the criminal investigation, a Victoria police officer with Socit told Beth the chaperone was employed by the bus company and the “school has no say in that”.

In correspondence seen by Guardian Australia, the senior constable said the chaperone was assisting with “minor maintenance works” at the school, which had since ceased.

The constable reminded the mother the chaperone had not been charged with any offences and was presumed innocent under the law.

At the time, a police investigation into abuse allegations was not enough prevent a person from having a valid working with children check – although new Victorian laws to allow such suspension have since been passed.

Beth said a detective called her 14 months after she first reported the allegation, to inform her the investigation had been closed.

Years later, Beth received a letter from the then department of education secretary, Jenny Atta, expressing “sincere apologies that the school did not adequately or appropriately respond” when she reported that the bus chaperone allegedly sexually assaulted her daughter.

“I apologise that the school and the department failed to implement adequate risk mitigation strategies while the allegation was being actively investigated by Victoria police,” the letter seen by Guardian Australia said.

Atta said the department also accepted the outcomes of the CCYP investigation, including that the conduct of the school principal and assistant principal “amounted to neglect”.

She also apologised for the department’s own internal review, which found the school met child safe standards, saying it “failed to identify the inadequacies of the school and department’s responses”.

Atta said the department had implemented changes since the allegation, including increased resourcing to help schools to respond to sexual harm allegations and a dedicated team to advise principals on immediate next steps such as contact with police.

A department spokesperson said it had apologised to the family for how the alleged incident was managed.

“Every child deserves to feel safe at school, including travelling to and from school, and any form of violence against children is not tolerated,” they said.

“We treat all allegations seriously and address all incidents with appropriate and proportionate consequences – including supporting families to make reports to police where appropriate.”

In response to the matter, the department had undertaken a “comprehensive review” of its safeguarding policies and procedures, the spokesperson said.

Showers and storms were forecast in all states and territories over the weekend, but north-eastern parts of New South Wales and south-east Queensland would be “particularly wet” and with severe storms expected, according to the bureau.

The BoM senior meteorologist Sarah Scully said those parts of both states “may see damaging winds, large hail or heavy rainfall that could cause flash flooding”.

Brisbane was expected to get rainfall of up to 80mm between Friday and Sunday, with damaging storms likely to develop on Friday night and hang around for most of the weekend.

On Friday evening, the BoM issued a severe weather warning for heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding, large hailstones and damaging winds affecting Toowoomba, Brisbane, Maroochydore, Ipswich, Cleveland, Gatton, Caboolture, near Crows Nest, the area south-west of Esk, northern Bribie Island and Somerset Dam.

There were reportedly 11,000 houses experiencing blackouts across Brisbane, Logan, Ipswich, Redland, Moreton Bay, Gold Coast, Scenic Rim, Somerset and Toowoomba areas.

The bureau forecast that storms in the Darling Downs, south-east and parts of Maranoa and Warrego could be severe – just two weeks after supercell storms wreaked havoc in the region.

This weekend marks the fifth consecutive one of severe storms in south-east Queensland, including supercell storms, “considered to be the most long-lived and dangerous of thunderstorms”.

“We’re well and truly into the severe weather season,” Scully said.

It was set to be a cooler start to the weekend in Sydney, with people waking up to a low of 17C on Saturday morning before warming up to 27C later in the day and a top of 31C on Sunday.

But it was forecast to be “a wet Saturday”, Scully said, with potential for showers and a possible afternoon or evening storm too.

“Saturday is sort of the peak day for the Sydney area, with the worst of the showers and the storms moving offshore by Sunday,” she said.

Severe storms were also possible for “the south coast, extending into the ranges and then extending right up into the Blue Mountains”.

In Melbourne, temperatures were forecast to reach a top of 21C on both Saturday and Sunday, but a low of 11C would mean a colder start to the weekend in that city too, with thunderstorms possible in the morning.

On Sunday, Melbourne was forecast to receive showers in the afternoon and evening, including a possible thunderstorm to finish the weekend.

Showers and storms were expected across northern parts of Western Australia from Friday until Sunday, while Perth would avoid all the wet weather with sunny skies bringing a top of 25C on Saturday and 29C on Saturday.

The BoM also warned a possible tropical low cyclone could form north of the Kimberley or Northern Territory next week, though chances remained low as of Friday.

Scully said the showers and storms expected across the country this weekend were caused by “multiple troughs of low pressure that’s combining with tropical moisture”.

“This trough tomorrow will extend all the way down eastern Australia into the south-east, drawing a cloud band as far south as Tasmania,” she said.

Aside from the wet weather, Scully also warned of fire danger ratings that were “expected to reach extreme” this weekend through the NSW central and southern slopes and plains.",2025-11-14T17:32:34.591694

Guardian Australia spoke to the former politicians and previous Liberal party candidates, who say any hopes of reclaiming inner-city and suburban seats at the next election have been dashed as a result of the move.

“This is a recipe for those seats becoming a lot more difficult to ever have a chance of reclaiming,” one former moderate MP said.

After months of protracted meetings and infighting, the Liberal party on Thursday announced it would abandon a legislated net zero emissions target and its commitment to renewable energy projects, while adhering to the Paris agreement – despite an evident contradiction to the accord.

The shadow ministry agreed a future Coalition government would also remove Labor’s legislated 43% emissions reduction target by 2030, and its 82% renewables target.

While a detailed energy and emissions reduction policy hasn’t been released, the opposition said its approach would be “technology agnostic” and include a mix of coal, gas, hydro, batteries, renewables and potentially nuclear.

The shadow housing minister, Andrew Bragg, defended the decision but acknowledged the Paris agreement requires a government to set ambitious emissions reduction targets.

“Emissions reduction is important to us as is getting lower prices and more abundant energy,” the prominent moderate senator told Sky News.

“So, I guess we’re trying to achieve those things simultaneously, rather than just choose one narrow objective which the government have pursued.”

The decision to dump net zero follows the party’s worst electoral defeat in 80 years, leaving a single Liberal MP – Goldstein’s Tim Wilson – as its only inner-city representative across the country.

The result followed the 2022 election, when six independents were elected over long-serving Liberal MPs – including in traditionally blue ribbon seats – on pro-climate, integrity and gender equality platforms.

Another former MP, who lost their seat to Labor in May, said the outcome had “existential crisis vibes”, and signalled the Coalition agreement had undermined the Liberal party’s identity.

“I think you can already see what the corflutes are going to say at the next election,” they said.

“I think what should happen is that the Coalition should [only] exist to form government, but you’ve got to have your separate identities, separate policies.”

A well known Liberal candidate, who will not run again, said it was “just another nail in the coffin of the party”.

“Yesterday guaranteed losing the votes of everybody under the age of 50 in one fell swoop,” they said.

“If they think the party’s got a future by behaving like that, they’re sorely mistaken. It might appease the 80-plus-year-olds that are still lingering around in a lot of the branches, but it’s a party without soul. It’s a party without a future.”

The former moderate Liberal MP Keith Wolahan, who lost his seat to Labor this year, said debate on climate change and emissions reduction has been “mostly driven by emotion and virtue signalling”.

“Unless the Liberal party in the Coalition wins more metro seats, it will always be a voice in opposition only, and I don’t think that’s in the country’s interest,” Wolahan told Sky News.

But the former Liberal MP Lucy Wicks, whose attempt to return to federal politics failed at the May election, said the policy announcement showed the party was “beginning to stand up for a purpose”, even if it does not win them seats.

“I don’t know what that could mean for us at the next election, but the most important thing we can do as a party is demonstrate to our community that we have a vision for Australia’s future and to bring people with us on that journey,” she said.

“It’s not just about power, [or] about winning for winning’s sake. Politics has also got to be about purpose.”

The Liberal-aligned thinktank Blueprint Institute commissioned polling by YouGov in August on voter attitudes towards the Coalition.

The poll surveyed 5,007 voters and found 52% of former Coalition voters said they “would only consider a party ready to govern if they have credible policies to address climate change and its impacts”.",2025-11-14T17:32:36.458504

The two countries have signed a “non-binding memorandum of understanding”, the Swiss government announced, following bilateral talks in Washington and intense lobbying by Swiss firms.

The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, also confirmed the breakthrough on Friday, telling CNBC, the financial news network, that both sides had “essentially reached a deal”.

The Trump administration agreed to limit US tariffs on Switzerland and Liechtenstein “to a maximum of 15%” under the deal, according to a statement from the Swiss government.

This brings US tariffs on Switzerland in line with those on the European Union – allowing Swiss exporters the same treatment as rivals in neighboring countries.

In return, Switzerland will reduce tariffs “on a range of US products”, the statement said. “In addition to all industrial products, fish and seafood, this includes agricultural products from the US that Switzerland considers non-sensitive.”

Swiss officials also committed to granting a series of quotas for US goods that can be exported to Switzerland on a duty-free basis, including 500 tonnes of beef, 1,000 tonnes of bison meat and 1,500 tonnes of poultry.

“The date for implementing these market access concessions will be coordinated with the US to ensure that customs duties are reduced at the same time,” the statement said.

This is the latest “framework” trade deal to be struck by Trump and his administration. Unlike formal free trade agreements, which are substantial and can take years to negotiate, these pacts have typically been narrow in focus and light on detail.

The precise timing of the implementation, and when the new tariffs and quotas will be enforced, has yet to be finalized.

“They’re going to send a lot of manufacturing here to the United States – pharmaceuticals, gold smelting, railway equipment,” Greer claimed on CNBC, “so we’re really excited about that deal and what it means for American manufacturing.”

The Swiss government said companies in the country were “planning to make direct investments” in the US worth $200bn “by the end of 2028”.

The deal was finalized after leading Swiss executives met with Trump at the White House earlier this month.

Rolex, the luxury Swiss watchmaker, also invited the president and a string of his officials to the US Open final in September. Upon arrival, Trump “did ask in jest whether he would have been invited had it not been for the tariffs”, Jean-Frédéric Dufour, the Rolex CEO, later disclosed. This was “a moment that brought a round of laughter all around”, he added.

An Ipsos survey of almost 10,000 people in Croatia, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the US found satisfaction with democracy low in all except Sweden, with deep concerns about the future state of electoral politics.

Gideon Skinner, senior director of UK politics at Ipsos, said: “Despite strong support for democratic ideals across many countries, the public are clearly disappointed with how democracy is working in practice and worried about its future.”

Skinner said the Ipsos State of Democracy survey showed that concern about democracy was growing fast in some countries, particularly the Netherlands and France, and that there was a strong desire for “radical change” in almost all.

Fewer than a third of respondents in six countries – 18% in Croatia, 19% in France (19%), 20% in the US, 26% in the UK, 27% in Spain and 29% in Italy – said they felt satisfied with how democracy was working in their country.

Opinions were divided in the Netherlands (36% satisfied, 37% dissatisfied) and Poland (40% satisfied, 31% dissatisfied), and Sweden was the only country in the survey where a majority were satisfied with how democracy is working (65%).

Across the nine countries, more people said democracy had got worse rather than had better in the past five years, with views in France and the Netherlands – whose governments collapsed during the year – particularly negative, and Poland the only exception.

Overwhelmingly in France (81%) and in the Netherlands (76%) respondents felt the way democracy was working had deteriorated, but clear majorities in the US (61%), Spain and the UK (58% each) also shared that same view. In Poland, 42% felt it had got better and 30% worse.

Looking to the future, large majorities in all countries bar Sweden were worried about the state of democracy in five years’ time: 86% in France, 80% in Spain, 75% in the UK and Poland, 74% in the Netherlands, 73% in Croatia, 69% in the US and 64% in Italy.

Few people felt governments at any level represented their views well, although local government did better. In none of the nine countries did a majority feel that their national government represented their views “a great deal” or “fair amount”.

Nonetheless, there was strong support for democracy across most countries, with clear majorities saying it was crucial to society and worth defending. Croatia was the only country to feel that it should be contingent on it delivering a good quality of life.

Fake news, lack of accountability, extremism and corruption were seen as the main threats, with disinformation seen as the biggest danger in France (56%), the UK (64%), Sweden (67%), the Netherlands (75%) and Poland (76%).

In the US (63%) and in countries in the south of Europe – Spain (73%), Croatia (80%), and Italy (47%, along with economic inequality) – respondents were more likely to identify corruption as the greatest threat.

Among a range of potential solutions for strengthening democracy, respondents identified mainly stronger anti-corruption laws and enforcement, stronger regulation of social media, better civic education and protecting the independence of the courts.

Despite the generally strong support for democracy, there was an equally strong desire for radical change, with more people in most countries thinking the system was rigged in favour of the rich and powerful rather than working for everyone.

Support for radical change was high in most countries, at 52% in Spain, 55% in Italy, 60% in Poland and the UK, 66% in France and 69% in Croatia. However, there was also a clear preference in all countries for political leaders who build consensus.",2025-11-14T17:32:42.685479

Shabana Mahmood is expected to set out plans to deter migrants from coming to the UK and make it easier to deport those who do, in a statement to MPs on Monday.

She is understood to have based some of the changes on the approach in Denmark, having dispatched officials there last month to study its border control and asylum policies.

Mahmood is also expected to be preparing changes to human rights legislation to make it easier to deport people who cross the Channel in small boats.

Changes would include requiring judges to prioritise public safety over migrants’ rights to a family life, or the risk that they would face “inhuman” treatment if returned to their home country, the Telegraph reported.

Home Office officials described Mahmood’s plans as “the most sweeping reforms to tackle illegal migration in modern times”.

Before next week’s announcement, the Home Office announced it had removed or deported 48,560 people from the UK since Labour came to power.

The figure, which includes refused asylum seekers, foreign criminals and others with no right to be in the UK, is a 23% increase in removals compared with the 16 months before last year’s election.

Mahmood said: “Nearly 50,000 illegal migrants have been removed or deported since the election. We’ve ramped up enforcement, deported foreign criminals from our streets, and saved taxpayers millions.

“I pledge today to scale up the removal and deportations of illegal migrants and do whatever it takes to secure our borders.”

The government has also sent about 100 people back to France under the “one in, one out” returns deal for those who cross the Channel in small boats.

But, despite the removals, small boat crossings continue to be a major political headache for the government.

So far, 39,075 people have made the journey this year, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office figures.

The figure is up 19% on the same point in 2024 and up 43% on 2023, but remains 5% lower than the equivalent point in 2022, the peak year for crossings.

On Monday, the Home Office confirmed a second man had re-entered the UK by small boat having been returned to France under the “one in, one out” deal.

The government said he would be deported back to France shortly and insisted his immediate detection and detention showed the system was working.

Denmark’s tighter rules on family reunions and restricting some refugees to a temporary stay are among the policies being looked at.

Some research has suggested that deterrence policies have little impact on asylum seekers’ choice of destination, but a 2017 study said Denmark’s “negative nation branding” had proved effective in limiting asylum applications.",2025-11-14T17:32:44.489683

Rubiales, convicted of sexual assault for a forced kiss on the player Jenni Hermoso after Spain won the Women’s World Cup, appeared to be struck on the back by an egg as the man Rubiales claimed was his uncle threw three in the direction of the 48-year-old.

“I’ve found out he was my own uncle; Luis Ruben he’s called. An uncle who is my age,” Rubiales told the news portal Periodista Digital. “He threw eggs at me because he’s a deranged person, and I don’t think there’s any justification for it. They’ve arrested him, they’ve taken him away and, well, we’ll have to take action against him because I honestly thought he was armed.”

National police stated that a Spanish man had been arrested but declined to confirm the family connection.

Rubiales tried to chase after his uncle before being held back by other people at the event to present his book Matar a Rubiales (Killing Rubiales). Speaking on Spanish television this week Rubiales claimed he was the victim of a “sudden far-left movement” that created a “parallel reality” to capitalise on the issue surrounding his forced kiss on Hermoso.

Rubiales was fined €10,800 (£9,550) for forcibly kissing Hermoso during the medal ceremony after Spain’s beat England in Sydney in August 2023. He insists it was consensual and his lawyer said in June Rubiales would appeal against the conviction at the supreme court after a Spanish appeals court upheld his fine.

Spain’s penal code dictates a non-consensual kiss can be considered sexual assault, a legal category encompassing all types of sexual violence.

The incident sparked global uproar and Rubiales relinquished his post. He was banned from all football-related activity for three years and the federation was plunged into a prolonged period of turmoil. The incident made Hermoso, the all-time top scorer for the national women’s team, a focal point of the fight against sexism and macho culture in sport.",2025-11-14T17:32:46.298263

The judges said Tantesh “showed immense talent and bravery in some of the hardest conditions ever faced by a journalist, she continued to report while having to forage for food and facing the constant risk of bombing and the threat of targeted killing”.

Tantesh, 20, reported for the Guardian from Gaza for 18 months. She described the impact of the war, losing close relatives and witnessing the aftermath of bombing first hand. She wrote about her family’s return to her birthplace in Beit Lahia, to find their home in ruins and their orchard destroyed. “My memories are crushed and buried,” she wrote.

In October, Tantesh published an article looking back on two years of war, which took the people of Gaza through a “gateway to hell”. There were times, she wrote, when the surviving members of her family envied the dead.

According to the UN, at least 248 journalists had been killed in Gaza by September, more than in any other conflict in modern times. There have been repeated allegations that Israel was deliberately targeting journalists. Israel has denied the charge, while claiming that some of the journalists its forces killed had been Hamas operatives.

Receiving the award on Wednesday, Tantesh thanked her parents for “raising me to be the person who I am now”.

“They are still there in Gaza, suffering what I was suffering during the past months,” she said, and went on to thank her sister Enas, who worked alongside her as a photographer in Gaza, and her cousin Seham, who has now taken up her position as correspondent. They had stood with her throughout her time working in Gaza, she said.

Tantesh also acknowledged the support of her editors and colleagues at the Guardian and “all the people who have stood with me all the way”.

In a lawsuit filed in federal court, Ramsi Woodcock, an antitrust law scholar, argued that the public university violated his first amendment and due process rights when it abruptly placed him under investigation in July, just days after he was promoted to full professor, over allegations that he violated university policy – including anti-discrimination rules that incorporate a widely disputed definition of antisemitism.

The lawsuit marks another chapter in the growing backlash against universities over their use of the so-called IHRA definition. Scores of faculty members at both private and public institutions have been placed under investigation – and in some cases fired or forced out – over criticisms of Israel characterized as antisemitic. The suit is the first to be filed by a professor against a university that explicitly challenges the constitutionality of the IHRA definition and the application of federal Title VI anti-discrimination protections to criticism of Israel.

Jay Blanton, a spokesperson for the University of Kentucky, said that Woodcock had not been suspended, but rather “reassigned” pending the outcome of the investigation. Woodcock has been banned from teaching, advising students, attending faculty meetings and accessing the law school’s building. According to the lawsuit, the only aspect of his job he is still able to carry out is “professional development”.

“Title VI does not and cannot constitutionally prohibit criticism of Israel,” the lawsuit argues. “To the extent that the IHRA definition prohibits calling for the dismantling of colonial state structures, prohibits legal scholars from debating the contours of the right of self-determination, prohibits allegations of race discrimination, and prohibits allegations of genocide, the IHRA definition is unconstitutional.”

But because Woodcock’s criticism of Israel goes well beyond more mainstream critiques – even some defenders of his free speech rights say his views could be understood to support violence against Israelis – the case is also bound to test the strength of constitutional protections for controversial speech. A petition by the Antizionist Legal Studies Movement, a group he founded, reads: “We demand that every country in the world make war on Israel immediately and until such time as Israel has submitted permanently and unconditionally to the government of Palestine everywhere from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.”

When the university first launched its investigations into Woodcock, the school’s president, Eli Capilouto, issued a public statement denouncing the petition as “calling for the destruction of a people based on national origin” and implying his speech “threaten[ed] the safety and well-being of the university’s students and staff” – both characterizations which Woodcock rejects.

In additional charges the university brought against Woodcock in September, it accused him of creating a “hostile environment” on campus and of “calling for violence against Israel, the genocide of Israeli people and the ultimate destruction of Israel in a manner that uses antisemitic tropes”.

Woodcock said in response to the university’s allegations that more than 80 other western colonies were brought to an end in the 20th century. “Does President Capilouto really believe that each involved the destruction of a people rather than the liberation of one?” he asked.

“People in this country have the right to express themselves,” Blanton said. “That is not in question. But the university has the right to express itself as well.

“If someone’s views as stated threaten the safety and wellbeing of the university’s students and staff, we are obligated to act to protect our community and our people. That’s clear under Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964. We have an obligation to find out if that’s the case,” Blanton continued.

Attorneys with the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), which is representing Woodcock, say that the petition is constitutionally protected speech. Had Woodcock been speaking about any other country in the world, including the United States, “he would have been free to do as he pleases”, Gadeir Abbas, Cair’s deputy litigation director, told the Guardian. “But because it’s about Israel, the University of Kentucky has given into the hysteria.”

According to a letter sent to Woodcock by the university and reviewed by the Guardian, the investigation was initiated after individuals outside the university complained about Woodcock’s statements against Israel at off-campus academic conferences, on a website he runs and in private chat groups of the Association of American Law Schools. The investigation is being led by Farnaz Farkish Thompson, an attorney who contributed to the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint. Thompson did not respond to a request for comment.

The Kentucky state senate adopted a resolution in April directing the state’s public universities to combat antisemitism by using the IHRA definition, which conflates some criticism of Israel with antisemitism. State legislators hailed the university’s investigation into Woodcock as soon as it was announced, calling his statements “incredibly disturbing”. “Kentuckians have every right to expect that our public universities will foster free and open debate,” said Lindsey Tichenor, a Republican state senator who co-sponsored the resolution and is a co-chair of the Kentucky-Israel caucus. “But when speech crosses the line into targeted hate, institutions must act.”

While challenging Woodcock’s suspension on free speech grounds, the lawsuit also alleges the university violated its own protocol, which previously permitted suspending faculty only upon a showing of “immediate harm”. According to the suit, the university revoked the policy after Woodcock complained about its violation. The university denies its policy changes were linked to Woodcock’s case.

‘Fighting words’ or academic freedom?

Woodcock strongly rejected the suggestion that his views threatened campus safety.

He said his calls for military intervention against Israel, and his views that the future of Palestine should be determined by Palestinians alone – including Jews who lived in Palestine before large-scale Jewish immigration began in the late 19th century – are consistent with recognizing Israel as a colonial project. Woodcock, who is part Algerian, often refers to that country’s experience of ending French colonial rule as a basis for his argument.

“If Israel has a right to exist, then French Algeria had a right to exist and the British Raj had a right to exist,” Woodcock told the Guardian in an interview.

Woodcock rejects the argument that his position is antisemitic but confirmed that his view of Israel as a colonizing power means the state should be brought “to an end”. The future of the land Israel occupies, he says, should be for Palestinians “alone” to decide – and “that includes according to Palestinians the right to decide the legal status of the colonizer population”. He adds: “While the principle that Palestinians alone should decide is essential to maintaining a rule against colonization, it is likely that Palestinians would grant equal rights to the colonizer population.”

Alvin Goldman, a retired law professor at the University of Kentucky and self-described “lifelong Zionist”, was an outspoken advocate of Woodcock’s free speech rights when the university announced its investigation. Goldman strongly disagrees with Woodcock’s premise of Israel as a colonizer and agrees with the university that his views might be interpreted as calling for a destruction of a people based on their national origin. But, he adds, “that of itself is not grounds for a state university to discipline or dismiss a professor”.

“It is not surprising to me that the call for the destruction of Israel can prompt an emotional response from many. I am among them,” Goldman wrote in a letter sent to the law school faculty a day after Woodcock’s suspension, which he also sent to administrators. In certain contexts, he adds, such calls might amount to “fighting words” – a reference to speech not protected by the first amendment – but says Woodcock’s calls don’t qualify as fighting words.

Goldman, who has challenged Woodcock’s views on private faculty channels, called on administrators to reverse their decision and instead sponsor opportunities for debate.

“Unfortunately, in the years since I began teaching, faculty have become more and more divorced from the principles of academic freedom and the principles of what constitutes a sound university environment,” Goldman said in an interview.

He said that Woodcock’s calls for Israel’s “end” are wrong but not antisemitic. He added: “He is entitled to be wrong.”",2025-11-14T17:32:50.107945

The settlers attacked the Palestinian villages of Beit Lid and Deir Sharaf, setting vehicles on fire and damaging property belonging to a Bedouin community, with charred remains of cars left behind the next day.

The al-Juneidi dairy factory, a big employer in the area, was also damaged in the attacks, and four of its trucks laden with products were set alight.

Israeli settler violence has surged since the war in Gaza started two years ago, with at least 1,001 Palestinians killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem by settlers and Israeli soldiers. According to the UN, 260 attacks took place in October, the deadliest month for settler violence since it started keeping track in 2006.

Human rights groups and the UN have warned that settler violence is taking place in a “permissive environment” and with the backing of key Israeli ministers. The UN human rights office said settlers were seeking to “accelerate displacement of Palestinians from their land, raising concerns of forcible transfer”.

In a rare statement on Wednesday, the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, condemned the latest attacks, saying the “shocking and serious” incident had been carried out by a “handful” of perpetrators. He called for authorities to “act decisively to eradicate the phenomenon and to strengthen the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] fighters and security forces who protect us day and night”.

His remarks were echoed by the top Israeli military official in the West Bank, Maj Gen Avi Bluth, who called the violence “unacceptable”.

The statements were unusual for Israeli officials, who have largely ignored settler violence against Palestinians over the past two years even as it has grown more widespread. The Israeli military and government officials have rarely addressed the settler movement’s growing violence against Palestinians, despite its contravention of Israeli and international law.

Bluth said it was only “by sheer luck” that violent incidents had not “resulted in fatalities”, despite the fact that settler and police violence has resulted in more than 1,000 Palestinian deaths over the past two years. Asked for clarification, the Israeli military said it was “checking” the comments.

Israeli settler violence has moved into the mainstream of Israel’s political scene, particularly in the past two years. The Israeli Knesset often hosts settlers to weigh in on policymaking. Israeli police and armed forces are regularly filmed standing by as settlers carry out acts of violence against Palestinians, intervening only if Palestinians fight back.

The Israeli army said soldiers had responded to Tuesday’s settler attacks, causing the settlers to flee to a nearby industrial zone, where they attacked soldiers and damaged a military vehicle.

The police also said they had arrested four settlers involved in the attacks, a rarity as settlers generally go unpunished in what human rights bodies call a system of impunity.

In July, Yinon Levi, a settler formerly under US sanctions, was caught on video shooting to death the Palestinian activist Awdah Hathaleen. He was briefly arrested and then released by Israeli authorities.

Human rights groups have accused the Israeli government of standing by as settlers carry out widespread attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. They point to the far-right makeup of the current Israeli government, including the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, and the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, both of whom are prominent leaders in the Israeli settler movement.

As attacks against Palestinians have increased, Ben-Gvir has helped loosen gun regulations and establish “civilian guard units”, which activists have warned could exacerbate the rising violence.

The increase in attacks by settlers has led to international outcry. Last month, a video of an Israeli settler clubbing a woman in the head – causing her to fall unconscious – triggered a wave of condemnations.

In October the UN human rights office accused Israeli authorities of investigating violence against Palestinians in the West Bank only “in extremely rare cases”.

“In these few cases, there appears to have been no progress, maintaining the almost complete impunity for the use of unlawful force and the unlawful killing of Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,” the UN said in a statement.

In Beit Lid, one of the two villages attacked on Tuesday, government statements did little to calm the fear of settler violence.

“At any moment something could happen … This can’t go on. It can’t be that we keep living our whole lives in a state of fear and danger,” said Mahmoud Edeis, a resident of the village.",2025-11-14T17:32:51.836648
47be0d78ad8132011c9352f2026bcb5d4043f61e,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/key-netanyahu-aide-ron-dermer-quits-israel-strategic-affairs-minister,Trump writes to Israeli president calling for Netanyahu pardon,"Wed, 12 Nov 2025 14:07:09 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss,"Donald Trump has repeated a request to Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, for a pardon for Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on trial in three separate corruption cases.

The Israeli prime minister has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the ongoing court cases. No rulings have been delivered, and his supporters have dismissed the trials as politically motivated.

In a letter released by Herzog’s office on Wednesday, Trump says he is writing to the president at a “historic time, as we have, together, just secured peace that has been sought for at least 3,000 years”.

“I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister … While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System … I believe that this ’case’ against Bibi … is political, unjustified prosecution,” he writes.

Trump has already suggested a presidential pardon for Netanyahu in a series of social media posts and a speech to the Israeli parliament last month. Despite the largely ceremonial role of the Israeli presidency, Herzog has the authority to pardon convicted criminals under unusual circumstances.

Netanyahu’s trials, which began in 2020, have not yet concluded, and he has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, are accused in one case of accepting more than $260,000 (£198,000) worth of luxury goods such as cigars, jewellery and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favours. He is also accused of attempting to negotiate more favourable coverage from two Israeli media outlets in two other cases.

Herzog has previously rejected Trump’s requests for a pardon, and on Wednesday advised the US president to follow the usual processes.

A statement from Herzog’s office said he held Trump “in the highest regard” and expressed “his deep appreciations” for the US president’s support for Israel.

“Alongside and not withstanding this … anyone seeking a presidential pardon must submit a formal request in accordance with the established procedures,” it said.

On Tuesday, Israel’s strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, who has been a key liaison between Netanyahu and the White House since his appointment in 2022, announced his resignation.

One of the most influential members of the country’s rightwing government, Dermer is a close aide of Benjamin Netanyahu and led months of intense negotiations before the US-led Gaza ceasefire deal that came into effect last month.

Dermer’s departure follows weeks of speculation in Israeli media. Critics accuse the US-born 54-year-old of failing to bring the war in Gaza to an earlier end, with some saying he helped Netanyahu drag out the conflict to avoid potential imprisonment on corruption charges if ousted from office.

Since the ceasefire took effect in Gaza, Hamas has freed all 20 living hostages it was holding and returned the remains of 24 deceased captives.

Dermer, a former ambassador to Washington, played a key role in US-Israeli relations throughout the conflict. Netanyahu appointed him in February to lead the truce talks, despite him being little-known among Israelis.

The appointment as negotiator drew immediate criticism over his lack of military experience, his rare appearances on Hebrew-language media and what some describe as his limited understanding of the country’s language and culture.

Elections are due in Israel within a year, and some analysts predict early polls.

Yossi Mekelberg, an expert on Israel politics at London’s Chatham House, said the consequences of Dermer’s resignation would be limited. “Netanyahu is definitely losing an ally who he trusted and felt closer than most others in the cabinet. Dermer is someone he trusts, but lacks any political base in Israel,” he said.

In his resignation letter, Dermer, who was appointed in 2022, said he had promised his family he would not serve for longer than two years, and praised the Israeli prime minister’s singular leadership.

“This government will be defined both by the [Hamas] attack on October 7th [2023] and by the prosecution of the two-year … war that followed,” he wrote.

“We rejected moral equivocation and fear to confront our enemies with clarity and courage. Two years later, we have dealt a devastating blow to Iran’s terror axis and are now powerfully positioned to usher in an age of security, prosperity and peace.”

A majority of Israelis across the political spectrum support the establishment of a powerful state inquiry under a panel appointed by the supreme court president to determine responsibility for the failures that enabled Hamas to launch its 2023 incursion into southern Israel, during which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostage. Four bodies are yet to be returned.

The ensuing Israel offensive has killed nearly 69,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians.

Netanyahu rejected fresh opposition calls to establish such an inquiry on Monday, suggesting it would not have “broad-based support” and that another format would be better. Opposition politicians fear a government commission would have lesser powers and be easier to influence.

On Wednesday, the Indian government confirmed it was treating the blast as a “terror incident” perpetrated by “anti-national forces”. The explosion took place outside one of India’s most significant monuments during rush hour on Monday evening.

Initially, eight people were confirmed dead, but the figure had risen to 13 by Friday as more victims succumbed to their injuries. It is one of the deadliest terror attacks to target India’s capital in more than a decade.

Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, described the incident as a “conspiracy”, while his home minister, Amit Shah, vowed to “hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”.

The authorities have yet to make any formal announcement about who they believe to be behind the attack. Unofficially however, Indian investigators have said inquiries are continuing into “an interstate and transnational terror module” that was targeted by the police in the days before the explosion.

An investigation into the group began last month, after posters promoting the Pakistan-backed armed terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad appeared in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir. The region has long been disputed by India and Pakistan, and since the 1990s the Indian-controlled south has faced a militant insurgency backed by Pakistan.

Seven people were arrested as a result of the inquiries, including two Kashmiri doctors working in other Indian states. During a raid of one of the doctors’ homes in the city of Faridabad, in Haryana state, police said they had uncovered 2,900kg of explosive materials as well as chemicals, detonators and assault rifles, which they now believe were being readied for a multi-target attack.

Though they have yet to directly link the group to the Delhi blast, police have described the network as a “white-collar ecosystem involving radicalised professionals and students in contact with foreign handlers operating from Pakistan and other countries”.

The day after the arrests, a white Hyundai car travelled from Haryana to central Delhi. After some time waiting in a car park in the bustling old quarter of the city, the driver pulled out into busy Monday evening traffic. Shortly after, the car exploded with huge force, throwing bodies into the air and setting surrounding cars and rickshaws alight.

On Tuesday, a case was registered under India’s anti-terror laws and the investigation was taken over by India’s National Investigation Agency, which oversees terror cases. Police in Kashmir have since ramped up their raids and arrests across the region.

Investigators have alleged that the car was being driven by another Kashmiri doctor from the village of Koil, 20 miles south of Srinigar. One of the doctors arrested the day before was also from Koil, and both were working at the same medical college in Faridabad.

People in Koil described both men as accomplished doctors known for their impressive academic records, and expressed shock at the allegations against them. Their two families denied knowing one another.

Police arrived at the home of the alleged driver just hours after the blast, searching the premises, confiscating all mobile phones and detaining several family members for questioning. Despite not formally confirming the doctor’s involvement, by Friday morning the authorities had demolished his home in an apparent case of “bulldozer justice” – a widespread but illegal tactic used by the Indian authorities to punish those accused of crimes against the state.

According to Kashmir police, the seven people previously arrested in the terror network case had links with both Jaish-e-Mohammad and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, an Islamic State affiliate operating in Kashmir. This could not be verified by the Guardian.

India’s response to the Delhi blast has been markedly restrained in contrast to the last terror attack that took place on its soil. When more than 20 Hindu tourists were shot dead in Pahalgam, Kashmir, in April, the Indian government blamed Pakistan and launched cross-border drone and missile strikes. Pakistan responded in kind, pushing the two countries to the brink of all-out war.

In the aftermath, the Indian government firmly stated that any more Pakistani terror attacks would be seen as an “act of war”. However, the more restrained language used this week by Modi’s cabinet is seen by some to reflect uncertainty over who may have been behind the latest attack and the alleged wider terror plot.

Police in Kashmir said they remained “on high alert to prevent further incidents”. A senior officer added: “Multiple agencies have conducted raids to disrupt terrorist activities. Investigation is ongoing, and we are monitoring all suspicious activity closely.”",2025-11-14T17:32:55.795784

The statement by the cabinet, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, confirmed mounting speculation that a terrorist attack was behind the blast that took place during peak time in one of the capital’s busiest areas and outside one of India’s major landmarks.

The explosion, from a car in bumper-to-bumper traffic, threw bodies into the air and caused nearby vehicles to catch fire. By Wednesday the number of dead had risen to 12 after several people died from their injuries, while more than 30 others were wounded. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Delhi for more than a decade.

The cabinet statement on Wednesday night condemned what it called a “dastardly and cowardly act that has led to the loss of innocent lives”.

The national investigation agency, India’s anti-terrorism squad, was handling the investigation and police filed a case under the country’s anti-terror law. Declaring the case a terrorism incident gives investigators expansive powers to carry out raids and arrests.

The cabinet statement did not give any further details on the nature of the terrorism behind the attack. However, earlier in the day police confirmed they had detained five people in the Pulwama district of the disputed region of Kashmir in connection with the attack.

Though the link was not directly made by police, it came after they claimed to have uncovered an “interstate and transnational terror” cell allegedly connected to the Islamist group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) operating in a state neighbouring Delhi.

The Pakistan-based insurgent group is primarily active in India-administered Kashmir, a region that has been disputed between India and Pakistan since their formation in 1947.

Police said they uncovered 2,900kg of explosives materials as well as chemicals, detonators and guns in raids early on Monday morning. At least seven people, including two Kashmiri doctors, were arrested as part of the terror cell raids.

Several sources briefing India media said investigators were seeking to determine whether the driver of the car that caused the Delhi explosion was part of the same terror cell, and whether Monday night’s attack was a panicked response to the arrests and raids.

The Red Fort explosion is the first terror incident in India since an attack in April when gunmen singled out more than 20 Hindu tourists and shot them dead. India blamed Pakistan for masterminding the attack and in May retaliated with cross-border missiles that it said targeted camps and JeM hideouts.

Pakistan denied any involvement in the April attack. It hit back with missile and drone strikes, bringing the two nuclear-armed countries the closest they had been to war in decades, before a US-led ceasefire stopped hostilities. In the aftermath, India repeatedly vowed that any further act of terror on Indian soil would be seen as an act of war.

With relations already at historic lows, India’s confirmation of the Red Fort blast as a terrorism incident risks pushing the two countries back towards full hostilities that could further destabilise the region. After the Red Fort blast, the Modi cabinet reiterated that it would take a policy of “zero tolerance towards terrorism in all its forms”.

The day after the explosion, a suicide bomber targeted a court complex in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, killing 12 people. The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack but the country’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, claimed “Indian state terrorism” was behind the blast.

On Tuesday, India’s home minister, Amit Shah, said he had instructed senior officials to “hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”. “Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,” he said.",2025-11-14T17:32:57.950146

Field Marshal Asim Munir, Pakistan’s powerful army chief who is widely seen as a de facto ruler of the country, was the main benefactor from the 27th constitutional amendment, which was passed by the parliamentary lower house on Wednesday.

The bill will be sent back to the senate, which already passed it on Monday, for minor tweaks before it is likely to be signed by the president, Asif Ali Zardari, formally enshrining it in the constitution.

Under the amendment, Munir – who was nominated to become a five-star general earlier this year – stands to have unprecedented powers. He will be elevated to the newly created post of chief of defence forces, overseeing not just the army but also the navy and air force, while also being granted lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.

Aqil Shah, an adjunct associate professor at Georgetown University in the US and author of The Army and Democracy: Military Politics in Pakistan, said Munir had “entrenched himself and future chiefs in power through an unprecedented constitutionally protected role”.

The immunity granted in the amendment, Shah said, “makes a mockery of the principle of civilian supremacy by placing him above all reproach”.

It also substantially undermines the powers and remit of the supreme court, which is the only remaining check on executive power. Under the amendment, a new federal constitutional court will be established above the supreme court, where judges will be selected by the executive, in a move critics said undermined any semblance of an independent judiciary. The decision of how and where to transfer judges will also rest solely with the president, removing any accountability processes.

Salahuddin Ahmed, a constitutional lawyer, said the amendment “completely destroys any notion of independence in the judiciary in Pakistan”, adding: “This effectively has set us on the way to a lifelong dictatorship in Pakistan.”

Opponents said the legislation served only to enshrine military rule and push Pakistan further towards all-out authoritarianism.

Since it was established in 1947, Pakistan has spent decades under full military dictatorships when military generals suspended the constitution altogether. But since 2008, after the fall of Gen Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan has emerged as a fragile democracy, ostensibly led by elected civilian governments – even if still largely manipulated or controlled by the powerful military behind the scenes.

In recent years, the military has been accused of taking greater control over the running of the country while consolidating the power of its most senior generals. As the army chief since 2022, Munir has travelled internationally in a role akin to head of state, including two unprecedented White House meetings with Donald Trump, which led to the US president referring to him as “my favourite field marshal”.

Figures from the ruling coalition government, led by the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, justified amending the constitution as a way to ensure modernisation and efficiency in the military and in the judiciary.

In the past, changes to the constitution have led to weeks of debate and disruption in the senate and the lower house. But in what analysts said was a sign of the weakness of the ruling coalition government – an unhappy alliance of two formerly rival parties – and the untouchable power of Munir, this time it sailed through the upper and the lower houses in a few hours, with only four lawmakers voting against it on Wednesday.

Pakistan’s largest opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was among those that boycotted the vote. But despite having large public support, the party’s power and influence have been systematically destroyed since Munir became army chief, and most of its leadership are behind bars. The party’s popular leader, the former prime minister Imran Khan, has been in jail for more than two years with little hope for his release.

The Tehreek-e-Tahafuz-e-Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), a multiparty opposition alliance including PTI, accused the government of “shaking the foundations of the constitution”.

In a joint letter, more than 100 lawyers and civil society activists called the amendment a “tampering of the constitution” and said there had been “no meaningful debate or engagement with members of the legal community, judiciary and civil society”.",2025-11-14T17:32:59.995750

The attack took place in the middle of the day on Tuesday as the area was thrumming with people. The bomber made several attempts to get inside the buildings before detonating a device next to a police car, killing 12 people and injuring 27.

It underscored the security challenges facing Pakistan as it grapples with a surge in terrorist activity.

The attack was claimed initially by the Pakistan Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). In a statement, the group said it had targeted “un-Islamic judges and lawyers”, though TTP’s spokesperson later denied the group was behind the attack.

Several Pakistani ministers also attributed the suicide bombing to TTP, the Islamist group behind hundreds of militant attacks in Pakistan this year, targeting largely police and security services in the border region of Khyber Pawktunkhwa.

Tuesday’s attack was the first major blast in years to target Islamabad, which was widely regarded as being safe from militant activity.

The attack could also have wider regional implications. On Tuesday night, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, issued a statement alleging that the attack was carried out by Afghan-based militants “at the behest of India” and described the attack as “nefarious conspiracy”, though provided no evidence for the claim.

In response to Sharif’s allegation, India’s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, denied the claim. “India unequivocally rejects the baseless and unfounded allegations,” he said.

Relations between India and Pakistan have hit historic lows after India accused Pakistan of masterminding a terrorist attack that killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir in April. Pakistan denied the accusation. The two nuclear-armed countries then came close to all-out war after exchanging missiles and drones in cross-border strikes in May.

India has accused Pakistan repeatedly of continuing to harbour terror groups. In response, Pakistan has alleged that “Indian-backed elements” have been behind a surge in destabilising militant attacks in the country, specifically by TTP and separatist Baloch militant groups in Balochistan.

Pakistan has also accused Afghanistan of providing a safe haven and training to TTP fighters, and heavy clashes broke out last month between the two countries. The Afghan Taliban have denied any support to TTP and have refused to commit to any measures to crack down on their activity in Afghanistan.

The blast in Islamabad came the day after an explosion in India’s capital Delhi left eight people dead. The causes still remain unclear but India’s anti-terror agency are heading the investigation and a case has been filed under an anti-terror law.

In a speech, the foreign minister and deputy prime minister, Ishaq Dar, called terrorism “one of the major global challenges of our time”.

“Let me be very clear: these cowardly acts will never shake or weaken our national resolve to deal with this menace,” he said.",2025-11-14T17:33:02.256692

The explosion on Monday occurred at about 7pm, a peak time when Delhi’s old city is usually packed with people and traffic.

The Delhi police commissioner, Satish Golcha, said the explosion had happened after a “slow-moving vehicle” stopped at a red light outside the Red Fort metro station.

The blast started a fire that ripped through nearby cars, motorcycles and rickshaws and shattered the windows of a Sikh place of worship 500 metres away. As well as the eight people killed, about 20 were injured.

The cause of the explosion had not been confirmed by Tuesday evening, but increasingly strongly worded statements from senior government ministers indicated they did not see it as an accident.

The home minister, Amit Shah, said he had instructed senior officials to “hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”. “Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,” he said.

The prime minister, Narendra Modi, said: “The conspirators behind this will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice.”

The Delhi police spokesperson, Sanjay Tyagi, said investigators were “probing all possible angles, including a terror attack, an accidental blast or any kind of failure in the car”. Officials were waiting on an explosives report from the forensics team, he said.

Delhi police confirmed they had filed a case under India’s draconian anti-terror law, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The home ministry confirmed that the case had been handed over to the National Investigation Agency, India’s counter-terror force.

Witnesses to the Red Fort blast said they saw limbs ripped from bodies and scattered on the roads. “I saw the car explode while it was moving,” Dharmindra Dhaga, 27, told Agence France-Presse. “People were on fire and we tried to save them … Cars and people were burning – people inside the cars were burning.”

Jai, 49, a shopkeeper, said the blast was so loud it damaged his hearing. “I heard a noise so loud my ears got blocked. Then I saw car parts flying and scattered body parts,” he said.

According to reports, investigators have turned their focus to the final movements of the vehicle in which the explosion is believed to have originated. On Monday night, two people were detained who were linked to the Hyundai car, which was registered in the neighbouring state of Haryana.

CCTV footage is reported to show the car driving into a car park in the Old Delhi area close to the Red Fort at about 3pm and remaining there for about three hours while the driver – who appeared to be wearing a mask – stayed in the vehicle. The driver was reported to have driven the car into Delhi from Haryana on Monday morning.

India remains on high alert, with extra security measures imposed at airports and along border areas. The financial capital, Mumbai, was also put under high alert.

The defence minister, Rajnath Singh, said findings of the inquiry would soon be made public. “I want to firmly assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice and will not be spared under any circumstances,” he said.",2025-11-14T17:33:04.012142

The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, will set out her revamp of the asylum and migration system on Monday, with officials saying it will draw heavily on ideas used in Denmark, which has tight limits on family reunions and sends some refugees back if conditions improve in their home countries.

The Home Office plan will also include already-mooted ideas to change the way the European convention on human rights (ECHR) is interpreted by UK judges so as to make it easier to remove people without lengthy court cases.

Government officials are billing Mahmood’s crackdown as robust but also the only way to restore public trust in the asylum system, and to potentially see off the threat of a Reform UK government that would dismantle asylum altogether.

Asked if the government was confident backbenchers would not seek to block the plans, as they did in June with welfare measures, a Downing Street spokesperson said this would not be tolerated.

“The government was elect on a mandate to secure our borders,” he said. “And while I’m not going to speculate ahead of the home secretary’s announcement, we are focused on the need to fix the mess we inherited and restore order and control to our asylum system.”

However, the briefing of elements of the plan to rightwing newspapers, and particularly the emphasis on using the model of Denmark, which severely restricts family reunions and in some cases asks asylum seekers to hand over jewellery or other valuables to cover costs, prompted an immediate reaction among some Labour MPs.

“It’s economically and culturally illiterate,” one said. “Are we really going to take the wedding rings of victims of trafficking, tell Ukrainians they can never put down roots?”

Another MP said they expected widespread scepticism among colleagues. “The policy of chasing Reform will not build confidence but fear and does not represent the values the Labour party holds,” they said.

Another expressed doubt that the plans would pass a Commons vote. “Getting something this controversial through when strong would have been tough. But frankly any Labour MP that has seen their majority destroyed by the rise in the Lib Dems and Greens will likely say no,” the MP said. “Weak governments don’t get to push through controversial policy.”

Expected changes to the use of the ECHR to be announced by Mahmood would include requiring judges to prioritise public safety over migrants’ rights to a family life, or the risk that they would face “inhuman” treatment if returned to their home country.

Home Office officials described the plans as “the most sweeping reforms to tackle illegal migration in modern times”.

Before next week’s announcement, the Home Office announced it had removed or deported 48,560 people from the UK since Labour came to power.

The figure, which includes refused asylum seekers, foreign criminals and others with no right to be in the UK, is a 23% increase in removals compared with the 16 months before last year’s election.

Despite the removals, small boat crossings continue to be a political headache for the government. So far this year, 39,075 people have made the journey, up 19% on the same point in 2024.

One government official said MPs should face up to the huge public disquiet about an asylum and immigration system they believed was out of control.

“We know levels of migration and asylum are putting huge pressures on communities,” they said. “Our generosity is drawing people in and the system is being gamed.

“If we don’t do this, there risks being no asylum system at all, particularly if it means Reform win the election. But there will be progressive elements. Denmark is a fair, tolerant and open country, with a centre-left government that has fought off the hard right through difficult choices.”

While this is an argument endorsed by a number of Labour MPs, especially those in seats where Reform UK will be the expected main challenger at the next election, others fear the government is putting off progressive voters and shedding mass support to the left, particularly to Zack Polanski’s Green party.",2025-11-14T17:33:05.987319

In its report on the commitee stage debate on the bill in the Lords, PA Media says:

Peers began their first of at least four days of detailed line-by-line scrutiny of the bill which could see assisted dying legalised for terminally ill adults in England and Wales.

More than 900 amendments have been put forward – the highest number ever tabled to a piece of backbench legislation.

The Dignity in Dying group, which campaigns for a change in the law, has warned “the risk of deliberate time-wasting is clear and profoundly unfair”.

But a number of peers told Friday’s debate they can only support bills which are “legislatively fit to be passed”, describing this one as “demonstrably flawed”.

The terminally ill adults (end of life) bill will become law only if both the House of Commons and House of Lords agree on the final drafting of the legislation – with approval needed before spring when the current session of parliament ends.

Gisela Stuart said there are “so many flaws” with the bill in its current form “that I don’t think this house, however long we debate it, can actually get it to a stage where it is legislatively fit to be passed, and that is our role”.

She told her colleagues on the Lords’ red benches: “We should not vote for anything that cannot legislatively be properly implemented.”

Andrew Tyrie said while he is a supporter of the bill’s intentions, it is “demonstrably flawed”.

He suggested the government must take more control of the draft legislation, which is currently proceeding through Parliament as a private member’s bill (PMB).

With less time allocated compared with government legislation, it can be more vulnerable in the face of any delays during the parliamentary process.

Tyrie said: “Surely the government should now be listening. They should now be grasping that they need to take this Bill in themselves … I think attempting to deal with these 900 amendments in this way is going to end up with the bill being talked out.

Former Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson urged the government to say what is “going on behind the scenes” to implement assisted dying.

A vocal opponent of the bill, the crossbench peer said she recently met a member of the public in the City of London, who said he was working “full time” on the rollout, adding: “I’m not sure he meant to tell me that.”

She told peers: “I think we do need to understand how many civil servants are currently working on this. Who’s running the Bill team?”

According to the parliamentary authorities, while some bills have had more amendments tabled in total at committee stage, this sets a possible record for the number submitted in the first full list of suggested changes and is almost certainly unprecedented for committee stage of a private member’s bill.

Not all tabled amendments will necessarily be debated as members can choose to withdraw theirs during the process.",2025-11-14T17:33:08.238263

The judge said Chao Xu’s offending was “calculated and planned” and he posed a high risk to women.

The 33-year-old was arrested in June and Metropolitan police detectives fear he may have hundreds of further victims, making him one of the worst sex offenders in British criminal history. They have still to examine 6m WhatsApp-style messages in Mandarin, as well as the full data from a series of computers, phones, USB sticks and memory cards.

Police searches of his flat in Greenwich, south London, found a phalanx of cameras hidden around his home, including in air fresheners, and one in a packet of female sanitary products.

He used his mobile phones to film attacks, ranging from rape to upskirting on the large escalator at London Bridge station and around London’s transport network.

He lured women to his home for parties or networking events where he served a cocktail he called Spring of Life, a mix of Chinese herbs and alcohol.

Xu would mix some of his cocktail with a date rape drug such as GHB and scopolamine, and give it to his intended victims, rendering them unable to fight him off.

One victim, a PhD student who was drugged and assaulted over several hours while Xu filmed her, said she felt everything, but could not fight back because of the drugs.

In a statement read to court, she said Xu “stole the person I was” and added: “He has changed me. I feel that I can never go back to who I was.”

She said she still struggled to sleep, fearing she could be attacked again, and suffered from anxiety: “I’m not sure how this is ever mended.”

Two victims said they feared Xu could take revenge and one said: “He has become a shadow in my heart.”

The prosecutor, Catherine Farrelly KC, told the court that one victim told police: “She had no strength to fight him off … she felt like she had lost control of her body, and she could not open her eyes.”

Xu pleaded guilty in August to 24 offences against six women. Those offences were four rapes, eight assaults by penetration, four sexual assaults, two counts of drugging women, four counts of voyeurism, and two counts of upskirting.

At Woolwich crown court on Friday Judge Grout sentenced Xu to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 13 and a half years before he could be considered for parole, and warned that, as a foreign national offender, he was liable for deportation.

Grout said he had concluded Xu “was an incredibly dangerous man”, his offending involving drugs and gaining the confidence of women was “calculated and planned” and that he gained enjoyment from his attacks.

The judge said the Home Office might consider deporting Xu.

Police say three victims have been identified and others have yet to be, and that at least seven women were sexually assaulted by Xu.

After Xu’s guilty plea, more than 10 further voyeurism victims had come forward, with victims of that type of offence numbering in the hundreds, according to police.

Det Supt Lewis Sanderson said Xu edited some of the footage he recorded of his attacks into a compilation for his own sexual gratification, and also watched rape pornography and other material so extreme that further criminal charges were being considered.

Farrelly told the court: “The evidence shows the defendant to be a bold and persistent sexual predator whose offending had steadily become more and more serious.

“He was so emboldened that he was willing to strike anywhere – at his own home address, at his place of work and in train stations, and in respect of anyone: friends, flatmates, colleagues and strangers.

“It appears that no woman was safe around him.

“His offending was mainly planned in a very careful way. He would use hidden cameras to record unsuspecting victims, whether by concealing them in his bathroom at home or by covertly using his mobile telephone to record what he was doing and, even more concerningly, he would use drugs – most likely GHB – to incapacitate some of his victims so he could then abuse them over the course of hours, recording what he was doing as some sort of token.”

The case is similar to that of Zhenhao Zou, who was jailed for attacking 10 women, having drugged and filmed the victims.

Police say there is no known link between Xu and Zou.

The two were placed in the same cell for a short time at Belmarsh prison but no evidence of use emerged, it is understood.

DCS Angela Cragg said: “Although both cases are very similar, we have no reason at all to believe they are connected or linked.”

Xu was caught when a woman he drugged and attacked called police from his flat in June.

She had gone to his flat for a networking party, accepted a drink, and then remembered passing in and out of consciousness with Xu on top of her, holding his mobile phone in one hand while repeatedly attacking her.

In the morning she demanded he show her what was on his phone. When he refused she called the police.

When officers arrived Xu handed his phone and pin code over.

Police said if it was not for her brave actions, Xu may still be free and attacking more women.

Police say he lured young females of Chinese heritage, students past and present from two London universities, Greenwich and King’s College.

According to officers, friends of Xu said he was generous with his money and offered career advice, with two victims saying they had trusted him and viewed him like a brother.

Xu refused to answer police interview questions, answering only to say “no comment” in Mandarin and requiring an interpreter in court. His university PhD in international law was in English.

Xu came to the UK in 2013 and studied for a masters at Greenwich University, then stayed to work as a partner in a recruitment business. His first known offending in the UK happened in 2021, lasting until 2025, and it is believed he also offended in China before.

Sanderson, said: “Chao Xu is among the most dangerous and prolific sexual offenders we have ever encountered. His crimes were calculated, sustained and devastating, spanning years and leaving unimaginable harm in their wake. Without their bravery, Xu’s offending could have continued unchecked.

Edward Brandt, 61, bombarded the former defence secretary with emails and voicemails and tried to jump the security barrier at her office.

Mordaunt, 52, cried as she told a court she feared for her own safety as a result of Brandt’s persistent behaviour.

The politician said she had to get colleagues to walk her to and from her car, change her office security and stop using public transport.

Brandt claimed he was not going to commit sexual violence and his only interest in Mordaunt was purely political and congratulatory.

After a five-day trial, Brandt cried into his hands as he was was convicted by a jury of stalking and acquitted of a more serious offence of stalking involving serious alarm or distress.

Brandt, from Freshwater on the Isle of Wight, stalked the former Portsmouth North MP between September 2023 and May 2024. He went to Mordaunt’s office in Portsmouth in December 2023 and tried to jump the barrier, before being stopped by security, the court heard.

The jury heard that 10 of his messages referenced wanting to shake her hand.

Mordaunt said it had taken a toll on her entire team and her foster child, whom she had to tell not to open the front door out of fear Brandt would come to her address.

Mordaunt was the MP for Portsmouth North between 2010 and 2024 and served as leader of the House of Commons in the final two years. She lost her seat to Amanda Martin in 2024.

Brandt will be sentenced in January next year.

Mordaunt said in evidence: “It is clear that this is not a normal pattern of behaviour and it is obsessive. I became increasingly concerned about his behaviour in the wake of his visit to my office.

“He was repeatedly saying how chivalrous and gentlemanly he was being in his approaches that I think it was an indication of his frustration and a true indication of why he wanted to meet with me. I found them obsessive and creepy.

“There was no doubt in my mind that he was a potential danger to me. It was clear to me that his motivation was not just to get an autograph or shake my hand.

“There were no threats of violence but his actions and messages to me were disturbing. The legacy of what he did was very profound.”

She added: “I believe that this man is a real threat to me and still is.

“He was fixated on me and the way I looked. He makes reference about my appearance. It is very clear that his intention is to have a personal and intimate relationship.

“He has been very keen to stress how polite and chivalrous he is being when he has been anything but that.”

Brandt said during a police interview in May 2024: “I thought that her witness statement was fundamentally inaccurate and I felt aggrieved by it.

“I am not about to commit sexual violence or stalk or sit on her doorstep. It is totally harmless.”",2025-11-14T17:33:11.962270

The departure of the Blackburn MP, who is secretary of the limited company behind Your Party, is yet another blow after renewed disagreements between Sultana and Corbyn, this time over the handover of membership levies.

Hussain was one of four independent MPs who, along with Corbyn, signed a Your Party statement on Thursday night accusing Sultana of unnecessary delay in passing on £850,000 in donations, a move that infuriated Sultana.

On Friday afternoon, Hussain said via X he had spent recent months reflecting on his role in an organisation he had believed would be based on “a commitment to equality, justice and anti-racism”.

He said: “Regrettably, the reality I encountered has been far from this vision. The culture surrounding the party has become dominated by persistent infighting, factional competition and a struggle for power, position and influence rather than a shared commitment to the common good.

“Instead of openness, cooperation and outward focus, the environment has too often felt toxic, exclusionary and deeply disheartening.”

Hussain condemned what he said felt like “veiled prejudice” in the way he and other Muslim independent MPs had been treated within the party, talking about “generalised accusations and offensive slurs”.

He also said he had not been prepared for the “very serious and damaging internal disputes” within Your Party over how it should be structured and organised.

While some observers had wondered whether Hussain and other independent MPs with sometimes socially conservative views were a perfect fit for an organisation set up by Corbyn and Sultana, the letter is a scathing indictment of the chaos that has plagued Your Party, much of it based on disagreements between its two principal figures.

In the most recent spat, allies of Sultana accused other MPs in Your Party of trying to undermine her with the statement on Thursday night, saying the timing, just before Sultana appeared on BBC One’s Question Time, seemed intended to hamper her chances of winning a possible leadership contest against Corbyn.

In response, Your Party sources said Sultana, a former Labour MP who now sits as an independent, was creating unnecessary barriers in arguing that there were legal reasons why she could not immediately transfer all the money from a company of which she is now the sole director.

It is understood there are nonetheless some worries within the party about the timing and tone of the statement.

The slightly convoluted row, one of several to erupt between Sultana and Corbyn’s camps in the organisation’s short history, originates in the fact that when a membership portal was first launched, Your Party had no formal structure or bank account.

The mass of membership levies and donations was thus directed to a newly formed company called MOU Operations Ltd, which now has Sultana as its sole director, with the idea that it would be passed on when Your Party was ready.

Your Party officials say they urgently need the £850,000 to run a conference at the end of this month and pay staff who have been acting as volunteers.

An ally of Sultana said the timing of Thursday’s statement was “damaging and irrational”. “They know they are demanding something she can’t legally deliver. She couldn’t be doing anything differently. It is very frustrating to find us in this position,” the ally said.

A Your Party source disputed Sultana’s arguments of a need for a delay in transferring the money, saying it was “desperately needed” to run the conference.

“The legal advice is that she absolutely can do it and she should do it, but she keeps shifting the goalposts,” they said.",2025-11-14T17:33:13.815680

The exchanges, from 2013 to early 2019, showed the two men sharing personal – and sometimes unseemly – views about politics and relationships.

“I’m trying to figure why [the] American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard,” Summers wrote to Epstein in a 2017 email. “But hit on a few women 10 years ago and can’t work at a network or think tank. DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT.”

At the time, Harvard University was wrestling with an admissions debate after a formerly incarcerated woman’s admission to a PhD program. Summers, a former president of the university who lost his position in a scandal after making sexist comments about female academics, went on to say in the email to Epstein: “I observed that half of the IQ In [the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.”

Summers was once a leading light in Democratic circles – a former treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, one of the primary engineers of Barack Obama’s response to the financial crisis and a stalwart in the liberal commentariat. But questions have lingered about his association with Epstein, a longtime associate of Trump. Epstein was accused of running a wide-ranging child sex trafficking operation before his death in jail in 2019 in New York City.

After the Wall Street Journal revealed a previous tranche of emails between Epstein and Summers in a 2023 piece, a spokesperson for Summers told the paper that he “deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction”.

Summers’s spokesperson has not yet responded to a request for comment from the Guardian.

Democratic lawmakers released emails from the Epstein estate this week that suggest Epstein believed Trump was aware of conduct by the now-convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. In response, Republican lawmakers released a much bigger tranche of 20,000 emails from the Epstein estate.

The documents show that Summers maintained congenial contact with the convicted child sex trafficker well into 2019, with the last email exchange occurring only months before Epstein’s arrest.

Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday that he would be asking the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate Epstein’s “involvement and relationship” with Summers, among other prominent Democrats and business leaders.

In the emails, Summers and Epstein discuss politics – particularly Summers’s contempt for Trump – as well as the details of philanthropic social networking – and women. Summers, 70, confided in Epstein in a 2019 exchange about his romantic gestures toward an unnamed woman, and being rebuffed.

“shes smart. making you pay for past errors,” Epstein wrote in an exchange on 16 March. “ignore the daddy im going to go out with the motorcycle guy, you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring., no whining showed strentgh.”

Summers reiterated his regret to the Harvard Crimson on Wednesday. “I have great regrets in my life,” he wrote. “As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement.”

Summers was president of Harvard University from 2001 to 2006. Epstein donated more than $9m to Harvard and its affiliated programs between 1998 and 2008, and was appointed a visiting fellow to conduct research. The university later concluded Epstein “lacked the academic qualifications visiting fellows typically possess and his application proposed a course of study Epstein was unqualified to pursue”.

Harvard only stopped accepting Epstein’s donations after he pleaded guilty to child sex offenses in 2008.

By then Obama’s star was rising. Summers would eventually win appointment as director of the White House national economic council (NEC) from January 2009 until November 2010.

After Summers left the White House, he began asking Epstein for philanthropic advice for his wife, Elisa New, a Harvard professor pursuing a poetry project, according to reporting by the Wall Street Journal. Epstein and his foundations made philanthropic donations to projects connected to Summers’s wife, and the two men met a dozen times between 2013 and 2016, often for dinner.

After reporting about Epstein’s donations emerged, New’s charity made a donation “in excess” of that received to anti-sex-trafficking organizations, a spokesperson told journalists in 2023.",2025-11-14T17:33:15.679226

28m ago 17.04 GMT George Chidi The only remaining criminal case against Donald Trump has been revived after the head of Georgia’s prosecutor’s council appointed himself to replace Fani Willis, the Fulton county district attorney, who was removed from the election interference case in September. Pete Skandalakis, a Republican and the executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, the state body that provides legal training and is often charged to mitigate prosecutorial conflicts, wrote in a statement on Friday that he would be taking over for Willis. A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using the state’s anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn Trump’s narrow 2020 loss to Joe Biden in Georgia. The alleged scheme included Trump’s call to the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, urging him to help find enough votes to beat Biden. The case remains the only criminal prosecution of Trump remaining, but it has been on life support after Willis was disqualified by the Georgia supreme court, which ruled that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, revealed in dramatic court filings in January 2024, created an impermissible appearance of a conflict of interest. Four people have pleaded guilty. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. While president, Trump is protected from state-level prosecutions, but the other 14 remaining defendants are still subject to prosecution. “The filing of this appointment reflects my inability to secure another conflict prosecutor to assume responsibility for this case,” Skandalakis said. “Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment.” Georgia prosecutor to take over last remaining criminal case against Trump Read more Share Updated at 17.04 GMT

2h ago 15.45 GMT GOP senators disavow funding bill provision that allows them to sue government over phone records Several Republican senators have expressed disapproval about a provision tucked into the stopgap spending bill passed this week, which would allow lawmakers to sue the federal government because their phone records were subpoenaed in 2023 by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. “There needs to be accountability for the Biden DOJ’s outrageous abuse of the separation of powers, but the right way to do that is through public hearings, tough oversight, including of the complicit telecomm companies, and prosecution where warranted,” said senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, one of the eight lawmakers whose phone data the FBI sought and obtained. For his part, House speaker Mike Johnson has pledged to repeal the provision next week, and many House Republicans are incensed about the language in the bill. “Interesting seeing my colleagues express outrage over this provision yet still vote for it when they could have been strong and not let the Senate jam the House,” said GOP member Greg Steube, who represents the Florida suncoast. “There was no reason this needed to be in the bill to reopen the government. The Senate used a crisis to pass an unethical provision and now the House is complicit.” Share

3h ago 14.37 GMT Callum Jones Americans should “raise hell” to protect US national parks through the “nightmare” of Donald Trump’s presidency, according to a former National Park Service director, amid alarm over the impact of the federal government shutdown. Jonathan Jarvis claimed the agency is now in the hands of a “bunch of ideologues” who would have no issue watching it “go down in flames” – and see parks from Yellowstone to Yosemite as potential “cash cows”, ripe for privatization. Jarvis, who led the NPS from 2009 to 2017, faced intense scrutiny, a five-hour grilling in Congress and calls for his resignation after closing all 401 national park sites during a previous shutdown, in October 2013. He was certain, despite the backlash, that it was the right thing to do: keeping them open with a skeleton staff would have put parks and their visitors at risk, his team concluded. Over the past month, hundreds of NPS veterans including Jarvis, 72, have watched aghast as most of the agency’s workers were furloughed during the longest shutdown in US history – while the Trump administration kept all national parks open. There have been consequences. A fire at Joshua Tree national park burned through about 72 acres. Yosemite faced a wave of illegal Base jumping. Yellowstone grappled with bear jams. Vandalism included graffiti in Arches national park. A stone wall at Gettysburg national military park was damaged. Trash started to gather at various sites. Thousands of NPS workers are typically around to guide visitors safely through parks, point them in the right direction, swiftly rescue them from danger, keep traffic moving, monitor wildlife and protect the landscape. “You take all of that away – all of those employees – you basically are, on one hand, creating unsafe conditions for the visitor,” Jarvis said, adding: “And you’re putting basically these irreplaceable resources at risk.” National parks facing ‘nightmare’ under Trump, warns ex-director of service Read more Share Updated at 15.03 GMT

5h ago 12.28 GMT As the Trump administration and Texas governor Greg Abbott restrict free speech on college campuses, two professors at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) are suing the university for retaliation stemming from 2024 arrests at a peaceful campus protest. History professors Ben Wright and Rosemary Admiral argue they should not have been arrested in the first place at the 1 May 2024 demonstration, where they were standing between their students and heavily armed law enforcement. Following the arrest, the professors say their university engaged in retaliation by severely restricting their access to campus, vaguely ordering that classroom instruction and “employment/research related activities” were the only permissible reasons for them to show up at work. “UTD wrongly banned these plaintiffs from campus entirely at first, falsely claiming a court required that,” said the professors’ attorney, Christina Jump. “No court required that.” The professors’ 29-page complaint, filed in a district court in Texas, names UTD and the University of Texas system as defendants, as well as former UTD president Richard Benson, current president Prabhas Moghe, Abbott and Ken Paxton, the attorney general. In addition to allegations that the defendants violated their civil rights, the professors also claim violations of the fourth and first amendments, arguing that they were unlawfully arrested without probable cause and later faced retaliation for peacefully protesting.

5h ago 12.19 GMT Trump puts intense pressure on Republicans to block release of Epstein files Lucy Campbell Donald Trump has cranked up his intense pressure campaign on congressional Republicans to oppose the full release of the justice department’s files related to Jeffrey Epstein, before a crucial and long-awaited House vote on the matter next week that scores of Republicans are slated to support. The belated swearing-in on Wednesday of the Democratic representative Adelita Grijalva – which the House speaker, Mike Johnson, had refused for almost two months during the government shutdown – brought the number of signatures on Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna’s discharge petition to the 218 needed to force a floor vote on legislation demanding the Department of Justice release all of its investigative files on Epstein within 30 days. It is expected that dozens of Republicans will vote for it, with the knowledge that their constituents want greater transparency about the affair and want them to hold the line. Representatives Don Bacon of Nebraska, Tim Burchett of Tennessee and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania have expressed they would do so. CNN reported that top officials summoned representative Lauren Boebert – one of four Republicans in the House who have signed the petition – to a meeting in the White House Situation Room with the attorney general, Pam Bondi, and FBI director, Kash Patel, to discuss her demand to release the files. Trump had also telephoned her early on Tuesday morning, a day before Grijalva was due to be sworn in and provide the crucial final signature. Trump also reached out to Representative Nancy Mace, another of the Republican caucus in the House who have signed the petition, but the two did not connect. Mace instead reportedly wrote the president a long explanation of her own personal experience as a survivor of sexual abuse and rape, and why it was impossible for her to change her position on the matter. She wrote on X that “the Epstein petition is deeply personal.” Those failed lobbying attempts from the White House came as Democrats on the House oversight committee released three damning new emails that suggest Trump knew about Epstein’s conduct, including one in which the convicted paedophile said “of course [Trump] knew about the girls”. Another email described Trump as a “dog that hasn’t barked” and said he had “spent hours” with one victim at Epstein’s house. The president’s team struck back, saying those documents had been cherrypicked, and Republican representatives followed up by releasing a much bigger trove of more than 20,000 files.

Taiwan’s presidential office, noting the arms sale was the first announced by the current administration, thanked the US government for continuing the policy of regularized arms sales to Taiwan and supporting Taiwan in enhancing its self-defense capabilities and resilience. “The deepening of the Taiwan-US security partnership is an important cornerstone of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region,” presidential office spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement.

6h ago 11.41 GMT Just 29% of Americans support US military killing drug suspects, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds Only 29% of Americans support using the US military to kill suspected drug traffickers without a judge or court being involved, a rebuke of President Donald Trump’s strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found. The six-day poll, which closed on Wednesday as Washington continued a military buildup around Latin America that has focused especially on Venezuela, showed 51% were opposed to the killings of drug suspects and the rest were unsure where they stood. In a sign of division within Trump’s party, 27% of Republicans in the poll opposed the practice, while 58% supported it, with the rest unsure. Three quarters of Democrats opposed the practice compared to one in 10 who supported it. The Trump administration has ordered at least 20 military strikes in recent months against suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean and off the Pacific coasts of Latin America, killing at least 79 people. Human rights groups including Amnesty International have condemned the strikes as illegal extrajudicial killings of civilians, and some US allies have expressed growing concerns that Washington may be violating international law.

Heavy rain began to pummel northern and central California on Thursday evening, as officials and forecasters warned that hazards unleashed by the strong storm were likely to amplify as it moved south.

Communities in Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties – especially those near burn scars where there are higher risks for mudslides and debris flows – could be in for a dangerously wet weekend, with two surges of rainfall expected between Friday and Sunday.

Parts of southern California were predicted to see up to 5in of rain in 48 hours, according to the National Weather Service. Downtown Los Angeles could face its wettest November since the 1980s. Evacuation warnings were issued in some LA neighborhoods close to areas affected by recent wildfires, where burn scars can increase the risk of a mudslide.

These types of powerful rainstorms, known as atmospheric rivers, have long been important features of weather systems across the US west and are vital to replenishing the state’s reservoirs and snowpack. The rains are expected to provide at least some relief for parched landscapes and the high fire risks that linger into autumn.

But filled with enough moisture to rival the volume of the flow at the mouth of the Mississippi – and often many times more – the strong systems that carry water across the Pacific can often cause the most destructive floods.

The second surge, which is predicted to start on Friday night into Saturday, is causing the most concern. While it was still unclear how much rainfall would hit specific parts of the state and when, forecasters with the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said there was a “growing risk for significant impacts on Saturday including dangerous flooding, damaging debris flows and major road closures”, and urged residents to heed advice from local officials.

Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties are facing high risks for debris flows and road and urban flooding. There’s even a chance that a tornado could develop, along with strong, damaging winds.

“Saturday would be a great day to plan indoor activities & avoid traveling if possible to stay safe,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles posted with a forecast update on Thursday evening.

Heavy snow is also expected, with up to a foot dumped along the slopes of the Sierra Nevada and up to 18in along the highest peaks.

Most of the dangers have passed in the San Francisco Bay Area, and officials allowed previously issued wind and flood advisories to expire on Thursday evening. The strongest gusts of wind reached 80mph in Marin county.

Meanwhile, southern California counties were bracing for the strong rains to begin. Topanga Canyon Boulevard, a mountain thoroughfare that was heavily hit by the Palisades fire at the start of the year, closed at 10pm on Thursday due to high risks of debris flows there, according to the California department of transportation.",2025-11-14T17:33:20.260765

The center’s experts were able to determine that the calls – which sounded almost like a human baby screeching – were coming from a roughly two-week-old sea otter pup that had been separated from its mother.

That could be deadly for young sea otters, according to Shayla Zink, who works at the center in Morro Bay.

“That pup is really relying on everything it learns from the mother to be able to survive in the ocean,” Zink said, adding that a mother sea otter cares for her pup for up to nine months, often carrying her small baby on her chest.

The employees at the center, with the help of the Morro Bay harbor patrol, jumped into action in what would be an hours-long journey.

First, they put the baby otter, who they named Caterpillar, into a safe container where it wouldn’t overheat. Then, they recorded the sound of the pup’s frantic cries.

The plan was to boat around the area blasting the sound of the baby through a Bluetooth speaker to attempt to lure the mother towards the boat. They used a recording because they were worried that the pup would get tired and stop screaming, leaving them without any way to let the mom know that her pup had been found.

It wouldn’t be easy, but it wasn’t the first time that a sea otter pup had been reunited with its mother that way – a similar technique had been used in 2019.

The center presides over marine mammals that live across approximately 600 miles (about 966km) of California coastline, but the small crew was determined, searching for two hours and playing the screeching cry nonstop, Zink said.

“Our intern had kept hitting play every once a minute,” she said. “I think we all went home and it was still playing over and over in our brains.”

Eventually, a female otter popped her head above water and followed the boat, which is behavior that Zink said wasn’t normal since otters typically only sleep, eat and groom their thick, furry coats – uninterested in humans on boats.

But this female otter was persistent, Zink said. Zink played the speaker on one side of the boat and then ran to play it on the other – and each time the otter followed her.

Eventually, once they felt certain that the otter was looking for her baby, the Zink lowered the pup into the water. Video shows the mother swimming over to her baby, who floats helplessly on its back. Eventually, the mom grabs her baby in her arms and appears to smell him, running her small hands over its dense fur.

“I definitely cried a bit,” Zink said.

The reunion has bigger significance to the region, where sea otters play a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of marshy banks and preserving biodiversity.

By the 1920s, sea otters were nearly wiped out by centuries of industrial-scale hunting for their fur pelts, decimating a global population that once stretched from Alaska to California, as well as into Russia and Japan.

Hunting bans and habitat restoration efforts helped southern sea otters recover some of their former range, but Zink said that there are still only roughly 3,000 southern sea otters located in the California region.

“It’s just a really special moment to be able to reunite this threatened species with its mother, because any and every individual in this population is so, so important to keeping it going and bringing it back from that threat status,” Zink said.",2025-11-14T17:33:22.058325
ba9bea4d5c1560b7212070fa82a52878173bec31,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/georgia-prosecutor-trump-election-interference-case,Georgia prosecutor to take over last remaining criminal case against Trump,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:30:49 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss,"The only remaining criminal case against Donald Trump has been revived after the head of Georgia’s prosecutor’s council appointed himself to replace Fani Willis, the Fulton county district attorney, who was removed from the election interference case in September.

Pete Skandalakis, a Republican and the executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, the state body that provides legal training and is often charged to mitigate prosecutorial conflicts, wrote in a statement on Friday that he would be taking over for Willis.

A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using the state’s anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn Trump’s narrow 2020 loss to Joe Biden in Georgia. The alleged scheme included Trump’s call to the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, urging him to help find enough votes to beat Biden.

The case remains the only criminal prosecution of Trump remaining, but it has been on life support after Willis was disqualified by the Georgia supreme court, which ruled that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, revealed in dramatic court filings in January 2024, created an impermissible appearance of a conflict of interest.

Four people have pleaded guilty. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. While president, Trump is protected from state-level prosecutions, but the other 14 remaining defendants are still subject to prosecution.

“The filing of this appointment reflects my inability to secure another conflict prosecutor to assume responsibility for this case,” Skandalakis said. “Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment.”

Fulton county’s courts have called on Skandalakis to resolve a conflict before in this case, after Scott McAfee, Fulton county’s superior court judge, found that Willis’s office had a conflict of interest with Burt Jones, who served as one of 16 “alternate” GOP electors in Georgia to cast a vote for Trump during the 2020 legal conflict over election results. Skandalakis ultimately declined to press charges in the case against Jones, who is now Georgia’s lieutenant governor and a candidate for governor in 2026.

McAfee set a 14 November deadline for Skandalakis to find a new prosecutor on the Trump racketeering indictment to avoid dismissing the case entirely.

“While it would have been simple to allow Judge McAfee’s deadline to lapse or to inform the Court that no conflict prosecutor could be secured – thereby allowing the case to be dismissed for want of prosecution – I did not believe that to be the right course of action,” Skandalakis said. “The public has a legitimate interest in the outcome of this case. Accordingly, it is important that someone make an informed and transparent determination about how best to proceed.”

Skandalakis noted that he did not receive the complete investigative file from Fulton county prosecutors until last week. He appointed himself as prosecutor to “complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed”.

In addition to Trump, Mark Meadows, the president’s former chief of staff, and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani remain defendants in the case. Trump pardoned Meadows and Giuliani of any federal crime related to the 2020 election, a largely symbolic gesture.",2025-11-14T17:33:23.829001
a44f6670f02d7f8c4d0a949bc6414c21fdb6ca90,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/14/trump-bbc-epstein-vulnerability-us-president-maga,Trump can get away with saying what he likes about the BBC. But Epstein? That’s his one vulnerability | Jonathan Freedland,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 17:12:51 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"To confront Donald Trump is to engage in asymmetric warfare. It is to enter a battlefield that is not level, where he enjoys an immediate and in-built advantage over those who would oppose him or merely hold him to account. That fact has cost Democrats dearly over the past decade – exacting a toll again this very week – but it has now upended an institution central to Britain’s national life: namely, the BBC.

The key asymmetry can be spelled out simply. Trump pays little or no regard to the conventional bounds of truth or honesty. His documented tally of false or misleading statements runs into the tens of thousands: the Washington Post registered 30,573 such statements during Trump’s first term in the White House, an average of 21 a day. In a single interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes earlier this month, Trump spoke falsely 18 times, according to CNN.

To hold him to account for this dishonesty is to cast yourself as an arbiter of truth, which creates the instant and obvious expectation that you yourself must be truthful. Here, then, is the asymmetry: he can lie, but his critics cannot.

So he can continue to tell the big lie, claiming against all evidence that he won the 2020 election, and myriad smaller lies – he told 60 Minutes that grocery prices “are down” when they are up and that Joe Biden gave Ukraine $350bn in aid when the real figure is well under half that – and, save for a few tireless factcheckers, no one cares. The response is a collective shrug, because it’s Donald Trump. No one expects any better.

The opposite is true of his scrutineers. They have to be fastidious, their evidence impeccable. So when the BBC’s Panorama programme examined Trump’s record ahead of the 2024 election, it had to be right on every detail. As we now know, and for which the BBC has apologised, it was not: it stitched together two statements, made 54 minutes apart, from Trump’s speech ahead of the Capitol Hill riot of 6 January 2021 to create a single, seamless call for violence.

There’s no defence to be made of that. No journalist would argue for the right to be as dishonest as Trump is allowed to be, even though misquoting and manipulating the words of others is a Trump specialism. That path is closed to those who want to criticise Trump for his untruthfulness.

Nor will it do to make the move some have attempted in defence of Panorama, arguing that the programme’s broad thrust was right, even if that specific edit was not. It’s quite true that plenty of 6 January rioters testified that they believed they were doing Trump’s bidding. It’s also true that Trump was impeached, even if eventually acquitted, for his role in inciting those events. But those facts cannot justify a deceptive edit. To say otherwise is to engage in what the US comedian Stephen Colbert famously called “truthiness”, substituting what feels to be true, or what we might want to be true, for what is actually true.

What’s at stake here is not only intellectual and journalistic integrity. It’s also that any slip is a gift to Trump and a setback to what, portentously, we might call the cause of truth – not in some high-blown, abstract sense, but very practically. Note the White House press secretary’s denunciation of the BBC as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine”. Mark those words, because they will be used again. Next time the BBC accurately exposes a Trump misdeed, or even asks a tough question, he and his allies will recall the Panorama edit and insist that whatever the BBC says can be safely ignored.

It’s for this reason that it is not the BBC’s many enemies, but rather its staunchest friends who should be taking the events of the last week most seriously. (Full disclosure: I have presented BBC Radio 4’s contemporary history series, The Long View, for many years.) A democratic society cannot function without a broadly accepted body of facts. The US no longer has that: there are red-state facts and blue-state facts; Fox News facts and MSNBC facts. The Watergate scandal that drove Richard Nixon from office would barely make a dent in today’s US: the right would simply deny the evidence, cheered on by its media allies.

What stands between Britain and that sorry state, in which knowledge is a matter of tribal affiliation, is the BBC. And yet for it to perform that vital function, the BBC cannot just be good; it has to be bulletproof. Which surely explains why it is some of those most committed to the BBC and its mission, people who have devoted decades of their working life to it, who, far from dismissing the internal report by Michael Prescott, have sought to wrestle with its more alarming findings of bias on a series of issues beyond the Panorama edit, from gender to Gaza. They understand that, as the distinguished former Newsnight journalist Mark Urban puts it, “failing to deal internally with issues like those raised by Prescott is a gift to the destroyers”.

None of this is fair. Trump’s lack of shame means he can say what he likes. But those who seek to protect the principles that undergird a liberal democracy – of which a basic, if necessarily imperfect, commitment to truth is among the most fundamental – hold themselves to a higher standard.

That habit constantly hands a huge advantage to Trump. A version of it was at work this week, when eight Senate Democrats broke from their party to bring an end to the standoff that had led to a 42-day shutdown of the US federal government. Politically, the Democrats were in the stronger position: polls showed voters blamed Trump and the Republicans for the stalemate. But, as one of the eight put it, the “mounting economic pain [and] risks to Americans’ safety” became too much to bear – and so they caved. In their shoes, Trump would have pressed his political advantage, the public’s pain be damned.

That disregard, for the public good as much as for truth, gives Trump tremendous power. So often he fights an opponent who is hamstrung by values he freely ignores. There may, in fact, be only one area where he is constrained by the same standards, subject to the same limits, as everyone else. And we got a glimpse of that, too, this week.

The area in question is Jeffrey Epstein. Democrats this week released new documents that suggest Trump may have known more about Epstein’s pattern of abuse than the president has admitted, or at least that Epstein wanted to give that impression. True to form, the president’s allies in Congress and on cable news played down the revelations. That usually works: if the target is the media or the Democrats, the Maga base will reflexively give Trump the benefit of the doubt. But the Epstein scandal is different.

Much of the Maga hardcore were first drawn to Trump by their conviction, strengthened by the QAnon conspiracy, that there was a secret, elite cabal of child abusers protected by the deep state – a cabal that Trump would expose and destroy. Any email or scribbled note that confirms he and Epstein were, in fact, chums shakes that confidence. It is the one thing the Trump faithful may never forgive him for. He could shoot people on Fifth Avenue – but he couldn’t do that.

Which is why the White House is currently straining every sinew to prevent the House of Representatives voting next week for a full release of the justice department’s Epstein files, a motion likely to be backed by several rebel Republicans who know how much this matters to the base. Trump calls the whole thing a “hoax”, as though all those tens of thousands of pages are forged. If they’d been produced by the BBC, he would get away with that. But Epstein is different. It’s the one battlefield that’s level – and the prospect terrifies him.",2025-11-14T17:33:26.077055
8451f30b9c72d312923ffc9302c47e463e13dc84,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/nov/14/stranger-things-final-season-cast-interviews,"‘It’s time for it to end’: the stars of Stranger Things open up about their final, epic season","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:00:39 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"How do you finish one of the biggest and most popular TV series of the last decade? Three years after season four came out, the fifth and final season of Stranger Things is about to make its way into the world. Millions of viewers are getting ready to find out what happens to the Upside Down and whether the plucky teens of Hawkins, Indiana can fight off Vecna for good, but it is early November 2025, and its creators Matt and Ross Duffer are finding it difficult to talk about. It’s not just because they’re feeling the pressure, or because the risk of spoilers and leaks is so dangerously high. It’s because the identical twin brothers from North Carolina are just not ready. “It makes me sad,” says Ross. “Because it’s easier to not think about the show actually ending.”

A decade ago, hardly anyone knew what the Upside Down was. Few had heard of Vecna, Mind Flayers or Demogorgons. In 2015, the brothers – self-professed nerds and movie obsessives – were about to begin shooting their first ever TV series. Stranger Things was to be a supernatural adventure steeped in 80s nostalgia, paying tribute to Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. Part of their pitch to Netflix was that it would be “John Carpenter mashed up with ET”. Winona Ryder and Matthew Modine were in it, so it wasn’t exactly low-key, but it was by no means a dead-cert for success, not least because it was led by a cast of young unknowns. The first season came out in the summer of 2016, smashed Netflix viewing records, and almost immediately established itself as a bona fide TV phenomenon.

A “would you rather” question for the brothers, then: would you rather have the demands of launching a brand new sci-fi series that nobody knows anything about, or would you prefer to try to stick the landing of a massive hit beloved by millions of viewers, knowing that every detail, every dollar spent, every character arc, will be scrutinised by an army of superfans?

“I would rather have the pressure of trying to stick the landing,” says Matt, after some consideration. In 2015, he and Ross had released their first and, to date only, feature film, a creepy, claustrophobic horror called Hidden. To their disappointment, it went straight to video-on-demand. “You can’t even watch it high definition right now,” says Matt. “So Stranger Things felt like we had been given this second chance, which a lot of people don’t get.” If that second chance hadn’t worked out, that would have been that. Now, he says, they are more secure. “Even if people don’t love the final season, I know that Ross and I will continue to be allowed to make things.”

On the other hand, he admits that it was fun to be the underdog. Ross agrees. “When we started, Netflix was an underdog, we were an underdog, and everyone loves a good underdog story,” he adds. “So it is a strange thing, 10 years later, to be the opposite of that. It’s a little surreal.”

“We almost prefer to be uncool,” says Matt. “I don’t know how cool we are.” He laughs. “We’re still not cool.”

In Stranger Things, being uncool is the whole point. With it, the brothers have taken nerd culture fully into the mainstream. Dungeons & Dragons, which features heavily in the show, has experienced a huge growth in revenue since 2019 and a popularity not seen since its 1980s heyday. “I hope we made some of this nerdy stuff cooler,” says Ross. “You know, the show is ultimately about outsiders. When Matt and I were young, especially in high school, we were just making little movies, and we were in drama club, and we had trouble fitting in. We just felt very separate from everyone else, and it was a very scary time for us. So part of the goal of the show was just to go, no, there are people out there like you, and your differences are what make you cool.” Matt says that one character sums up that ethos in particular: Eddie Munson, season four’s metal-loving leader of the Dungeons & Dragons-playing Hellfire Club. “In many ways, we think of the show itself as Eddie, because Eddie is the person I wish had existed in high school, but did not exist.”

Season four, which came out in 2022, had a sizeable impact on pop culture. Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) soundtracks a pivotal scene, when Max (Sadie Sink) finally escapes from the villainous Vecna in the Upside Down by using the song as a kind of anchor. The subsequent exposure gave Kate Bush her first UK No 1 single since 1978. “We had no idea it would go viral in the way that it did. We were surprised, and Kate was surprised, by how much it connected with younger people. Kate thought that was really cool,” says Ross. There is even more Running Up That Hill in season five.

“Again, she’s been so great about it,” says Matt. Did she send a cake or flowers, to say thank you? “We did get a gift from Kate Bush, but it was way cooler than flowers,” says Ross. “It was this gilded bird cage with animatronic birds inside it, and you wind it up, and the birds chirp a little song. It’s very cool, very unique and very Kate Bush. Only Kate Bush would give this present.”

Having played no small part in celebrating the careers of 80s icons such as Ryder and Modine, the brothers recruited yet another movie legend for the final stretch: Linda Hamilton, AKA The Terminator’s Sarah Connor. Hamilton plays Dr Kay, a steely military scientist in charge of another mysterious laboratory. “We needed to sort our Dr Brenner replacement,” explains Ross (the evil government scientist met his end in the Nevada desert, as season four drew to a close). “And because this was the final season, we wanted someone intimidating, but in a very different way than Modine.” Hamilton is “super-highly intelligent”, so she is believable as the scientist, “but at the same time, Linda can shoot a gun, she can get in a fight, she’s tough, and that toughness was perfect for the final season”.

“She’s kind of scary,” agrees Hamilton, calling from her home in New Orleans. Hamilton is famous for the physicality of her roles; as Sarah Connor, she is one of the all-time-greatest action heroines in movie history. Is there more action in Stranger Things? “There are a couple of real fightin’ moments,” she laughs. “I mean, I do walk into every stunt rehearsal and go: ‘I’m 68 years old! When do I get to not have stunt rehearsal?’” She has a stunt double, who was also her double on the last Terminator film. “But I’m carrying my own there. Doing at least half of it.”

When Stranger Things came calling, Hamilton had been talking to her agent about retiring from acting altogether. “I had a hip injury, and I was in pain, and limping, and I couldn’t get an injection until I was getting ready to do a job,” she says. She told him she didn’t think she could do another TV show. “I just got really defeated there for a minute. And then he called me months later and said: ‘Stranger Things just called and asked if you’re free from June to June, and I said yes.’” She laughs. “We know each other so well. I did not hesitate to say, yes, let’s talk.”

She already loved Stranger Things, and admits to being a fangirl. Walking on set for the first time was “very overwhelming, quite frankly. I didn’t have a lot of time with the Duffer brothers. Everything is so overly large in that show, and they didn’t coddle. They trusted me to put a character together that was going to come alive on camera, but you don’t know if you’ve done the right thing until you’re halfway through that first day and go, yeah, yeah, yeah, I’m finding it.”

During the bumper-length season four finale, a weakened Vecna managed to open another gate to the Upside Down, collapsing the barriers between the regular world and the shadow dimension and setting the scene for an ultimate showdown between good and evil. Season five sees the residents of Hawkins under military quarantine, jumping forward in time a little to November 1987. The show has always faithfully recreated the 80s, from the cars to the technology, right down to the food packaging. “A time that I’ve lived through!” says Hamilton. “My God, the 80s. My joke has always been that when a young actress comes up to me and says: ‘Knowing everything you know, what’s the most important thing for a young actress?’ I say: ‘Never go on film in the 80s.’” She laughs. “I know that a lot of people are enchanted by the 80s, but the 80s was not, to me, the greatest. So it’s really funny that here I am, at my age, playing someone back then, in that look.” The hair is large in the show. “The hair is very large.”

The trouble for Hamilton, now, is that she never watches herself on screen. As a fan, surely she will have to watch the final season to see how it ends? “No, I’m afraid not,” she says, a little sadly. “It’s terrible, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything I’ve done and wished I couldn’t do it again, and do a little bit more.” She refuses to put herself through it. “But I did get to read it, and be in the rooms with the actors during the readings and totally feel it.” She had the live-action experience? “Yes. It was amazing to be in that room for the final two episodes. Just, a blob of crying twentysomethings. It was really, really powerful to be part of that. Just a crying blob of children.”

(I ask the Duffers if they feel good about ruining the ending of Hamilton’s favourite show by making it impossible for her to watch. “That’s what she’s saying,” says Ross. “She’s gonna watch the show! I know other actors who are in the show and watch it, but fast-forward through their scenes. I’ll try to convince her, because she has to watch it.”)

View image in fullscreen End of days … Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard in season five of Stranger Things. Photograph: Netflix

Back in the present day, a considerable portion of that crying blob of twentysomethings are sharing breakfast. Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas), Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin), Finn Wolfhard (Mike) and Noah Schnapp (Will) are picking at fruit plates, discussing what it feels like to become a Halloween costume. On set, says Schnapp, he would entertain himself by trying to guess which scenes might eventually show up as costumes.

“Like when we did the stuff in season four, where we dressed up in the ghillie suits, and I was wearing your bandana,” says Matarazzo, turning to McLaughlin. At the end of season four, the gang wears military gear to battle in the Upside Down. Look closely, and you’ll see Dustin with Lucas’ famous bandana over the top of his hoodie.

“You were wearing my bandana?” says McLaughlin, sceptically.

“Yeah!”

“No you weren’t.”

“Yes I was!”

They bicker like a family. The boys – though to call them boys is to tie them to the youth of their characters, as in real life they now range from 21 (Schnapp) to 24 (McLaughlin) – share the relatively rare experience of having grown up, on screen, in public, together. They were barely in double digits when they started work on Stranger Things. “When you’re younger, you tend to normalise weird situations around you,” says Matarazzo. “It’s not something you recognise as being peculiar until you’re a little older.” When they weren’t filming, Matarazzo attended a normal school in south Jersey where he grew up, which kept life steady for him. “It made a difference later on, but really, I always felt the most normal when I was with these guys. Even though it is a very weird environment, it was normal to me. It was normal to us. I felt the most comfortable when I was with them.”

It must be strange for them that Stranger Things is about to come to a close, having taken up almost half of their lives. “Playing these characters has been amazing, and I think their storylines have come full circle, and it’s time for that to end, right?” says McLaughlin. “But growing up with these guys, and having the family that we’ve built, is something I won’t get again. I’m gonna miss that a lot.”

Wolfhard is more introspective. He says they haven’t even seen the second half of season five, which will arrive in two further instalments, on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day. Any answers they give to my questions might change when they have. “So it feels weird to come up with surface answers, because the hard part, for me, is that it is a lot to process, and it is really emotional. There’s a lot of layers to it.”

On the last ever day of filming, Wolfhard says, everyone was there. “We can’t officially say what we shot, but yeah, we were all together on the last day.” This is not typical – on most series or films, actors finish their scenes at different times or even different days, and leave gradually. This was not the case on Stranger Things, says Matarazzo. “It was important to all of us that we were there for each other. There were people who had wrapped a few days or maybe even a week prior, who decided to stay and make sure that everybody was there for that last day. That was a very necessary experience. It’s been 10 years.”

The Duffer brothers had long known what the final scene of Stranger Things was going to be. When they began to work with writers on season five, they spent weeks and weeks on those last 30 minutes. “That’s where we started, because we knew that if we didn’t get those 30 minutes right, then it didn’t matter how much time and effort and quality was put into what preceded that. It wouldn’t matter,” says Matt. It was the first time they had worked that way, and when they were happy with the ending, they got started on the rest. “We were able to design it so that it would be building towards those last 30 minutes,” he explains.

Then, for a split second, he echoes the many millions of fans who are all waiting patiently for its conclusion: “Hopefully, it works.”

We’ll pass!’: Joel Edgerton and Clint Bentley on their Oscar-tipped lumberjack tragedy,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 05:00:18 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"America was built by men like Robert Grainier, the stoical lumberjack at the heart of Train Dreams. Grainier cuts the trees and tames the forest and lays the ground for railroads and towns. Technically, then, Train Dreams is a western. But he never once ropes a steer, shoots a bandit or circles the wagons ahead of a Comanche attack on the plains. The small print tells a different kind of story.

It was a hard film to pitch, admits the actor Joel Edgerton: an uphill struggle; plenty of studio trepidation. “You go into the meeting and say: ‘Well, it’s a movie about a guy who’s not really making choices for himself. He’s kind of pushed around by life.’”

“He’s not a big hero,” agrees the director, Clint Bentley. “Also, there are some supernatural elements.”

“It’s a spiritual movie,” adds Edgerton. “You have to be patient.”

Bentley play-acts the role of a studio boss. “It sounds beautiful,” he says. “It sounds lovely. We’ll pass.”

I’m delighted they got it across the line. Train Dreams is beautiful, spiritual, but it is also rugged and pitiless and resolutely earthbound, planted in the soil of the Pacific north-west and lovingly grown out of Denis Johnson’s 2011 novella. Edgerton plays Grainier, the itinerant logger in 1900s Idaho, dwarfed by towering fir trees and white pine. Each job takes him deeper into the northern woods, further away from his wife and infant daughter, Katy. “I feel like I’m missing her whole life,” he complains.

I meet Edgerton and Bentley in a London hotel, their latest stop in an ongoing international press tour. Edgerton explains he has just arrived from LA and is leaving for New York in the morning, which means he’ll be away from his kids for the next two weeks. “And as privileged as I am, I still can’t reconcile my working life with my family,” he tells me. “I mean, surely I can rule the world. I’m an important actor, I can do whatever I want. But no. I’m a contract worker and the kids have to be in school. And if they don’t go to school then I go to jail.”

I don’t have the tragedy of Robert inside me, but I’ve imagined it. As soon as you become a father you imagine it

So what is he saying: that Hollywood film-making is the business class version of logging? “Yeah, that’s what I’m saying,” he laughs. “This is true. Woe is me.”

Edgerton has been on the circuit for 30 years, mostly working as a hired hand but occasionally developing and directing his own movie projects. He first read Train Dreams a decade ago, discovered that the film rights were taken and reluctantly moved on. By the time Bentley tapped him to play the lead role, he was settled in London with his partner, Christine Centenara, a journalist, and had recently welcomed the arrival of twins. Midway through the story, Grainier’s life takes a tragic turn. Rereading Johnson’s novella, Edgerton found that it spoke to him more than ever.

“I don’t have the tragedy of Robert inside me, but I’ve imagined it,” he says. “As soon as you become a father you imagine it and it’s terrifying. In the lead-up to our kids coming into the world, there was a moment when we thought they were not going to make it. And I find that when I think about those days there’s a pit in my stomach that will live there for ever.”

Train Dreams is Edgerton and Bentley’s joint venture, but it is also a collaboration between Bentley and his regular creative partner, Greg Kwedar. The two men have a policy of sharing writing duties while taking turns to direct. Kwedar shot their previous outing, the prison drama Sing Sing (2023), whereas Bentley took the reins on Jockey (2021), which trailed an ageing horseman on one last lap of the track. Bentley’s own father was a journeyman jockey who lived out of a suitcase and survived race to race. Jockey, he concedes, was semi-autobiographical. Perhaps on some level Train Dreams is as well.

“As a film-maker you’re often the last one to know what interests you until someone tells you,” he says. “But sure, both Jockey and Train Dreams are about a man who’s away from his family. My dad certainly lived that life. Some of it I lived alongside him – dragged from track to track, babysat by the trainers. But a lot of it I didn’t; he was gone for long stretches. And then I myself turned into some version of that. That’s a hard thing to reconcile.”

Like Grainier, like his father, Bentley moves from one job to the next. His wife and young son live in Texas and await his return.

“I love being with my family,” he says. “But I love being on the road. If I didn’t have a family, I’d be happy living in Motel 6s for the rest of my life.”

It’s the classic cowboy vacillation, the ambivalence at the heart of most movie westerns: the yearning for home versus the call of the wild. “Not to get too psychoanalytical here, but being on Train Dreams did make me feel like my dad,” Bentley says. “My son was just at the age where my absence from home made an impact. He knew I was gone. And one morning, brushing my teeth, it was like I connected to my dad in his motel, brushing his teeth in the mirror. He’s passed on; I can’t talk to him. But I suddenly understood him in a way that I hadn’t before.”

Men don’t talk – perhaps that’s partly the problem. Edgerton has always been good at playing tough, taciturn types, whether it’s the navy commander in Zero Dark Thirty, the enigmatic lord in The Green Knight, or brutish Tom Buchanan in Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby. But I’ve never seen him so magnificently tight-lipped – nor so purely heartbreaking – as he is in Train Dreams.

There are directors who are too scared to communicate with their actors. I know of some high-profile actors where the director figures, ‘It’s not my place to tell you what to do’

If Grainier has an ancestor, Edgerton thinks it was probably his role in Jeff Nichols’ fact-based 2016 drama Loving. Edgerton played Richard Loving, a construction worker in 1950s Virginia who is arrested for marrying a local black woman. He says: “At the end of the first week of shooting, I like to check in with my directors, because I have that actor’s paranoia. So I always say to them: ‘Please tell me if I’m doing anything that you want done differently.’ And on Loving, Jeff said: ‘I want to understand you less.’ That was a big help. The character was nonverbal. Robert is as well. So it focuses you in a completely different way.”

All of which makes perfect sense. Even so, I’m surprised he has to go cap-in-hand for direction. Shouldn’t the director be directing? The job description is in the title. “Yeah, well, why I ask that is because there are directors who are too scared to communicate with their actors,” he says. “Hopefully I’m not one of the terrifying ones. But I know of some high-profile actors where the director figures, ‘It’s not my place to tell you what to do,’ and doesn’t say anything for the entire film. That’s something that Hollywood is guilty of a lot: the actor is king. Maybe king is the wrong analogy. But the director should always be the head of the household. I worry that some directors feel they’re not allowed to talk to their actors. And I worry that some actors feel that the director doesn’t have to do anything except set up the shots.”

In other words, people need to communicate more. “Absolutely,” he says. “And what’s the point of being a director if you don’t talk to your actors?”

Having slogged so hard to get Train Dreams finished, Edgerton and Bentley are free to sit back and drink in the acclaim. The picture is amassing rave reviews and is being tipped as a dark horse Oscar contender. The veteran director Paul Schrader recently called it “a reverie” and “a film designed to envelop you”, although he also mistakenly called it “Traffic Dreams”, which suggests the publicity campaign has some way left to run. But if Train Dreams tells us anything, it’s that life is short and success is fleeting. Grainier, for instance, spends his days chopping giant 500-year-old spruce only to see his wooden trestle bridges replaced by ones made of steel. Every human achievement risks becoming faded and forgotten. That goes for railroads and families, and motion pictures as well.

Edgerton nods. “One of the reasons that I love working in film is that you think a film will live for ever. This was a movie shot by real people in the woods. The aliveness of it all – the realness of it all – is preserved. My dream is that it becomes like bespoke boot-making or vinyl, and that humans will always want to interact with human-made things. But who knows, maybe not. Because now you can create the woods on a laptop. You can make a whole film out of zeros and ones.”

That’s tragic, of course, but it also makes the work feel more precious. He says: “Probably one day we’ll see the last analogue movie. And we won’t know that it is until it’s already been and gone.”",2025-11-14T17:33:29.693684
fd9e12e74b98bb91a24bcfacbef46f1ca154730e,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/nov/14/healthcare-kashmir-mountains-giving-birth-alone-gujjar-bakarwal-pastoralists-maternal-mortality,Born in the forest: the women giving birth alone in the Kashmiri mountains,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 06:00:22 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"Dawn had just broken across the trail through the Pir Panjal mountains when Fatima Deader felt the first labour pains. She and her family had almost reached the midway point of their 134 mile (215km) trek from Rajouri in Jammu to Kashmir’s higher pastures. Mist clung to the forest, and the ground was slick beneath the feet of the caravan of about 70 pastoralists who had stopped to camp together the previous night.

A week from her due date, she had been travelling on horseback and assumed the discomfort she felt was fatigue – until pain tore through her body.

“There was no clinic, no nurse, no doctor,” Deader, 23, says. Only her mother and a midwife, Saira Begum, were with her in a damp canvas tent, whispering prayers. Hours after her son was born, and still weak and bleeding, Fatima had to ride again, her baby carefully tied to the horse with her, as the group’s journey continued through dense forest, home to tigers and bears.

The 3,500-metre-high Pir Panjal pass, also called Peer Ki Gali, connects the Jammu region to the Kashmir valley via the centuries-old Mughal Road, and each year when the snow melts, nearly a million nomadic Gujjar and Bakarwal herders set out with their goats, sheep and horses on journeys that can last months.

For those who are pregnant during the migration, heavy loads still have to be carried, and rest found in tents pitched on wet ground. Babies are born under trees, by riverbanks or in forest shelters.

Some women give birth after days without a proper meal. Those who make it to district hospitals often arrive exhausted, anaemic or suffering from an infection.

Fozia Choudhary was 16 when she gave birth in 2016. “I was still a child myself,” she says. Married to her cousin at 14 – early marriage is common among tribal families – she often had nothing to eat but a cup of milk and a single roti flatbread each day. By the time she went into labour, she was dangerously weak.

We have only the knowledge passed down to us – no medicines, no doctor. If I fall sick, who will help these women? Saira Begum, midwife

Choudhary was one of the lucky ones who made it to hospital, but doctors were shocked at her condition. “They shouted at my husband, asking how I had even survived this long,” she says.

The teenager required a blood transfusion – “four bottles” – before she could safely deliver the baby. Recovery was slow and painful.

For such women, survival often depends on traditional midwives. At 63, Begum has helped deliver dozens of babies along the mountain routes. “Sometimes there is so much blood loss we can’t save the mother,” she says.

“I remember [a woman called] Gulnaz. We were in Doodhpathri, high in the hills, in 2021. The nearest hospital was six miles away and we had no food or water left. She was eight months pregnant, already sick with a liver problem. She died there, before we could get her any help.

“We have only the knowledge passed down to us – no medicines, no doctor,” she adds. “If I fall sick or grow too old, who will help these women?”

A 2022 government study estimated Jammu and Kashmir’s maternal mortality ratio (MMR) – the number of women dying from pregnancy-related causes per 100,000 live births – to be 46, better than India’s national figure and well below the global average of 224 deaths. But these numbers obscure the experiences of nomadic women, whose lives largely go undocumented in official health data.

Dr Mushtaq Wani, a public health researcher in Srinagar who works with nomadic communities, says: “The state’s MMR figures come from hospital deliveries. Women on migration routes rarely reach clinics in time, so preventable deaths go unrecorded.”

Kashmiri local politician and physician Dr Yasin Rather says that for decades successive administrations in the territory have promised mobile healthcare for Gujjar and Bakarwal women, but support has never materialised.

A senior Jammu and Kashmir government health official, who wanted to remain anonymous, admitted that staffing, funding and the terrain made medical support difficult.

District hospital doctors confirm the consequences. “Many women arrive after walking or riding 10-15km in labour,” says a doctor in Baramulla, who also requested anonymity. “By the time they reach us, it is often too late to prevent complications, or even to save the mother. Severe anaemia, infections and obstructed labour are common.”

The gap in healthcare is compounded by poverty, early marriage and malnutrition. Many women, particularly girls who married young, enter pregnancy undernourished and physically underdeveloped, which increases the risk of maternal and neonatal complications.

International organisations say this is not unique to the region. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) notes similar patterns among pastoralist women in other countries where migration routes leave those facing childbirth out of reach of conventional healthcare. Pilot projects in Mongolia, Ethiopia and Somalia have attempted to address the lack of resources for nomadic women.

In Mongolia, an outreach initiative using mobile clinics – part of a broader health programme supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) targeting remote communities – provide preventive care and ultrasound scans to herders in areas many hours from clinics.

Ethiopia’s mobile health programme in the Afar and Somali regions delivers antenatal, immunisation and nutrition services to hard-to-reach pastoralist communities through travelling health teams.

Back in the forest, Begum folds her cloths after helping another young woman deliver her baby. “What else do you have in the jungles, except an old woman’s hands?” she asks.

The new mother, Fatima, rocks her newborn by the glow of a fire, echoing her sentiment. “We survive by luck,” she says. “But every year, another woman does not.”",2025-11-14T17:33:31.623262

When it opened its doors near Times Square in New York City, the “photomaton” – which produced pictures from a carefully orchestrated mechanical darkroom inside – was an instant hit. A reported 280,000 people lined up to use it in the first six months.

To mark 100 years, nine writers shared their favourite photo booth pictures, and we asked Guardian readers to show us their favourites and tell us what they mean to them. Here are some of their stories.

I met Johnny through friends in 1988; I wrote my name and telephone number on a parking ticket. We hadn’t been dating long when we went to a movie and there was a photo booth. We were still in that awkward dating phase, but we hopped in.

Now we’ve been together for 37 years, and married for 35. The beauty of being with someone since you were young is that you see each other, in many ways, as those same kids falling in love. I’m older, I’ve had two kids, my hair is greying, but when Johnny looks at me, a part of him still sees the 20-year-old girl he was falling in love with in the photo booth.

There was something so special and meaningful about photo booths back then. Today’s ubiquity of digital photos detracts from how significant it was to capture a moment in time – to freeze it for posterity – and tuck the strip of four photos into a scrapbook or put on your dresser.

Johnny still carries the parking ticket with my name and number in his wallet to this day. It has moved from wallet to wallet, and survived occasional washings, but it’s still there. Jackie Wesson, 57, attorney and law professor, Alabama, US

In this photo, I’m 40. My daughter had just turned one, I was 10 weeks pregnant with my second daughter, and we were in Edmonton airport on our way to Rome on a family holiday. This photo was taken near the departure gate as we waited to board our flight.

When our daughters were little, my now ex-husband and I went to photo booths with them whenever we could: photo booths are instinctively fun, irreverent, built for moments of joy and freedom. They captured the fleeting nature of children growing up, and many of these strips remain some of our most cherished photos.

Having children had always been immensely important to me but I didn’t have my daughters until late in life. I ended up having them close together, and even though my second daughter is not visible here, I like to say that my complete joy in being a mother twice shines through.

I’ve never felt more “me” than in this photo, and I’m so happy that it was taken in a photo booth: natural, unrehearsed, four different shots. Paula Wade, 55, writer and designer, Alberta, Canada

My girlfriend Ellie and I moved to Berlin together in 2020. During lockdown, we loved just walking around the streets together – and the city is dotted with all these amazing ancient photo booths. Proper analogue ones, where you don’t see what you’re going to get. They can be a real gamble, but that’s the magic.

We tried to get as many photo booth pictures as we could. By the time we moved back to London a couple years ago, we’d built quite a collection.

When I decided I was going to propose, I wanted to do it somewhere sort of private, but fun. And we had a trip to Berlin planned. My friends thought my idea of a photo booth was perfect.

All day I was nervously trying to navigate past one, but didn’t manage it until after dinner – when I convinced her to take a detour on the way home from seeing friends. She was totally shocked! She had no idea it was coming.

In the first image, I’m faffing trying to get ring out my pocket. In the second, Ellie went in for a kiss as I was trying to ask: “Will you marry me?” In the third she’s shocked at seeing the ring. And in the fourth: It’s a yes!

It was a bit chaotic, but I wouldn’t have had it any other way. That’s the charm of the photo booth: the chaos, unpredictability and fun. Laurence Dawes, 35, London, UK

‘It’s about 1976 in Penarth … and reassuring to see the bond I had with my mother’

It’s about 1976 in Penarth. It was a day at the seaside. My father was an artist and photographer who usually wandered off looking for inspiration while I had fun and laughter with my mother, Jane.

I found the photo strip about 35 years later, when I was clearing the house after my father’s death, in a tin in my childhood bedroom. My daughter, who was then 20, was with me when I found it. I just dissolved into tears.

‘This photo captures the urgency and fragility of gay love in the mid-80s’

It was the Christmas holidays in my first year at Leeds University in 1986. I had met a boy in the first term and we were dating.

He lived in Windsor and I lived in Wandsworth, London. Neither of us was out to our families at the time and homophobia was heightened in the buildup to section 28.

The iceberg/tombstone Aids campaign was just starting, and so gays were not only despised by many, but we were also feared.

He and I met up in central London and spent a day together, but we were unable to hold hands or demonstrate affection. When the time came for him to get his train home, we slipped into a photo booth so that we’d have pictures of each other – but also so that we could have some privacy to say goodbye to each other properly.

For me, this picture captures the urgency and fragility of gay love in the mid-80s.

Although our relationship lasted under a year, we remain close friends. We mean very different things to each other now, but our bond has endured. Matthew Hodson, 58, actor and HIV advocate, London

The photo was taken in 2014 while I was on a sabbatical in Paris. We were passing through a part of the underground, I believe, and saw a photo booth, deciding it would be fun to get a quick picture. The photo shows my wife, Emma, and daughter, Madeleine, who was four or five months old at the time.

We all had a good laugh at the results from the photo booth, particularly the surprise on Madeleine’s face when the flash went off. In fact, I plan to use it as the cover of a book I am writing on the family history for Madeleine.

This photo is of us at our wedding in September 2024. We had hired a photo booth for the reception, which was a lot of fun – you can see my wife “scissoring” my nose.

Just a couple of months later, in November, we found out we were expecting twins, so that domestic bliss of being married was very short before we were preparing for parenthood.

The photo strip was taken at our friends’ wedding earlier this year and neatly captures a whimsical moment in our lives: a snapshot of peak merriment. My wife, Aimee, was in her third trimester, and she had that perpetual maternal glow, and I was levitating at our fast track to seeming adulthood. We look back upon that time with such nostalgia and fondness. And it wasn’t even that long ago.

‘I felt a strong need to document us’

In the late 1990s my kid Max and I often cycled to the local five-and-dime store to hit up their photo booth after my cancer diagnosis. I felt a strong need to document “us” for Max’s sake, as he was so young – he wasn’t quite four at the time. I had a terrible prognosis and thought I was checking out soon. I have a stack of photos from the booth at that time.

My hair was just starting to grow back in these photos, and I was trying to experience my son and happiness and joy, and we do look happy and joyful in spite of it all. I love our intertwined hands and glee.

I had gone to a professional photographer, but didn’t like the photos of the two of us as they looked so stagnant and staged. I loved the spontaneity of photo booths – you never know exactly when the light is going to go, and they always capture something surprising or ridiculous.

Although the shop is long gone, I’m still so grateful for that photo booth.

Alongside, perhaps, a smidge of national pride to see the daft lad from Fresh Meat, Bad Education and Travels With My Father all grown up and holding his own.

The glossy thriller in question is Malice, in which Whitehall plays Adam, a tutor promoted to manny (male nanny, for those not au fait with rich people’s terms), who is bent – for reasons as yet unknown – on ruining high-rolling businessman Jamie Tanner (Duchovny). Whether he has it in for the rest of the Tanner family and friends, or they are just doomed to be collateral damage, is not clear, but that doesn’t spoil the machiavellian fun.

Adam arrives at the Tanners’ opulent Greek island estate as tutor to the children of Jamie’s guests, Jules (Christine Adams) and Damien (Raza Jaffrey), who are very much the beta setting for the Tanners’ alpha display. Adam quickly makes himself interesting (with his knowledge about the surrounding islands’ mythic heritage, thanks to studying classics at university) and useful (with his knowledge of cocktail and calamari-making and willingness to do domestic chores while still having time to accompany Jamie to local strip clubs).

As he goes, he gathers information about his hosts (including the suggestion that they are hiding as much as holidaying, in the hope that “a situation” involving their oldest child will resolve itself); flings Jamie’s passport in the sea; poisons food; flirts with Jamie’s wife, Nat (Carice van Houten); and sets various traps for the unwary family and their employers. Some close quickly. Some take their time.

While Adam is grifting and plotting, Jamie and Duchovny are having a great time. Jamie because he is a rich, entitled asshole insulated from the consequences of his actions – at least so far – by his wealth and power; Duchovny because rich, entitled assholes in glossy TV thrillers get all the best lines. The part of Jamie plays to all Duchovny’s strengths as an actor: roving intelligence, dry wit and an unassailable detachment from proceedings. We believe in him as a ruthless multimillionaire and as a man good enough not to deserve whatever is coming at him.

By the end of the first two episodes, which were all that were available for review, Adam has his feet firmly under the Tanner table – which has now moved from Greece to their London mansion, and is overseen by a large portrait of the happy family. Malice is very good but it is not subtle. (See also: the snake in the family pool early on; several characters voicing some variant of: “That Adam fellow – I find him disquieting in some indefinable way”; and Adam standing over the drunk, unconscious Jamie and telling him he could kill him right now but won’t because he wants him to suffer as he has.) That is, of course, a large part of the fun.

Some ways have been cleared. Some unexpected obstacles – a dogged Greek detective assigned to the mugging of the man with whom Jamie has a longstanding dispute over the land he built on, or a stomach unusually resistant to poisoned avocado – have been overcome. More, doubtless, will arise as the family start to wonder why their perfect lives are falling apart and whether this new guy is as perfect as he appears. Is there something nasty in the gilded woodhouse?

It’s The White Lotus meets The Talented Mr Ripley, of course, tapping into viewers’ distaste for, and fascination with, the lives of the fabulously well-off, and eternal attraction to the underdog who seems set to bring the whole shining thing down.

It’s a great ride, and Whitehall acquits himself well in his first lead dramatic role, even if he is better at oblique menace than delivering straightforwardly murderous speeches. Duchovny is as skilled, nimble and charismatic as ever, giving us a Hank from Californication if he had gone into real estate rather than writing and made enough money to keep his chaos at bay. Moreish, bingeable stuff to take you happily through to Christmas.",2025-11-14T17:33:35.523376

Text messages released by the House oversight committee on Wednesday detail a six-day exchange between the men from 17 to 23 August, and show Epstein coaching Bannon on television appearances and political messaging.

One side of the conversation is sent from an iMessage account associated with an Epstein email address, and while the name of Epstein’s correspondent is redacted in the documents as released, contextual clues – including references to Fox News appearances, his August 2017 firing from the White House and his work on the documentary Trump @War – make it clear the other participant is Bannon.

It is not known whether the released material is excerpted from a longer conversation. Bannon did not reply to multiple requests for comment from the Guardian. When Elon Musk said earlier this year that “Bannon is in the Epstein files”, Bannon told the Independent he wanted a special investigator to look into “all” the Epstein documents.

The exchanges offer a detailed picture of Bannon’s efforts to continue supporting Trump a year after his acrimonious departure from the White House, and show Epstein’s close involvement in crafting messaging on tax cuts, immigration and even security clearance revocations.

They also show the two men’s responses to breaking scandals. When news broke on 23 August that National Enquirer publisher David Pecker had received immunity in the Michael Cohen case, Bannon texted “Huge event huge”, followed by “More women payoffs coming.”

The messages begin with Epstein offering immediate feedback on a live media appearance by Bannon. The venue is not identified in the chat records, but YouTube archives indicate that on 17 August, Bannon was interviewed on MSNBC by Ari Melber.

“How did it go?” Epstein asked as the interview concluded.

Epstein appeared to be watching the broadcast live, telling Bannon: “I took off early so I could land in time to watch. all good?”

Bannon responded: “They went for an hour instead of 30 minutes--- showing the entire hour over multiple platforms.”

Epstein shot back “atta boy”.

The pair then engaged in banter, with Epstein writing: “You looked so clean cut next to him i thought i turned on the figure skating channel by accident.”

Bannon responded: “My ‘come hither’ look.” Epstein replied that was “Better than the usual ‘come hitler’ look”.

Bannon, who has been credited with a central role in the resurgence of far-right populism around the world, responded: “Ouch”.

When Bannon mentioned he had prepared carefully for the appearance, saying he wanted to be “‘clean’ not sloppy” for what he called the “‘soy boy’ network”, Epstein responded: “Closer to toy boy ;)”

Epstein then offered more considered feedback on his performance and appearance, writing, “Last ten minutes , more the real you,” which he followed with some detailed advice on staging: “Your eye is the best , so important for you to watch the play reel. Over the shoulder for him , 3/4 for you. ?? lighting. . hot for you . /. chairs . ? too restrictive for you.”

Epstein took an active role in developing talking points for Bannon’s media appearances at that time, particularly about economic policy. The messages show Epstein crafting detailed responses to criticism of Trump’s tax cuts.

“We can discuss response to tax cut criticism. The 83 percent to rich is misleading by miles . Cash back. Pension funds up,” Epstein wrote, adding: “Corporations are not people. Giving corp breaks , is perceived as giving it to someone else. wage inflation cant be the first focus, the additional money in the system. First goes to hiring new people, only afterwards can wages rise.”

Epstein also complained to Bannon about people turning on him amid a developing scandal about his previous activities and his apparently favorable treatment by federal prosecutors.

On 22 August, he wrote: “Fyi, there is a guy , totally nuts , out of jail after 20 years that has been sending letters re me to all agencies , stalking . etc. wants a billion dollars. No real threat , just one more pain.”

He added: “Steven hoffenberg, . He bought the ny daily news for 1 dollar. Etc.”

Steven Hoffenberg was imprisoned in 1998 for his role in a $500m Ponzi scheme – one of the largest in US history. According to Hoffenberg’s reported claims, and legal filings, Epstein was also involved in the scheme. In August 2022, Hoffenberg was found dead in his Connecticut apartment at the age of 77.

The messages reveal discussions between Bannon and Epstein about Maga world figures including Thiel and Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived Trump communications director.

On 18 August, Epstein wrote: “Message: Im back wed . ( Thiel coming ). ”

Three days later, he laid out a set of priorities for Bannon: “1. Peter Thiel in town… 4. The mooch [Scaramucci] ( still in contact with Ivanka ) has reached out to me , and asked how he can re engage with you. ?? I ve only met him once. odd.”

The messages capture the two men’s reaction to major developments in the Michael Cohen case. When news broke on 23 August 2018 that National Enquirer publisher David Pecker had received immunity, both recognized its significance immediately.

Epstein texted: “Pecker immunity one more drop.”

Bannon responded: “Huge event huge.” He added: “More women payoffs coming.”

Elsewhere, the pair appear to try to conceal their own collaboration from wider scrutiny.

On 23 August, Epstein wrote: “Btw Im in New York tonite thru sat , if you want to visit under the cover of darkness or breakfast tomorrow if you like.”

Bannon replied: “Do u have access that’s not the front door-- they have 24/7 surveillance on u.”

Epstein responded, “Im happy to come see you if better.”, adding: “Message: separate from the process server that left yesterday or the early morning doorman next door. Any Idea of who?”

Bannon responded: “Don’t know but real folks costing lot of coin.”

Epstein continued: “Can meet at 301 East 66 , if you prefer . I will send apt #.”

Epstein owned an apartment on East 66th Street in Manhattan.

Bannon responded: “I don’t like he regency as it is totally wired.”

In a string of messages, Epstein tried to accommodate Bannon’s apparent desire for secrecy, writing: “There is also a rear entrance on 67 , if you prefer”; “Super secure ,”; and “Someone can meet you and take you in.”

Bannon, apparently satisfied, responded: “Just set a time. Ill be in after 430.”",2025-11-14T17:33:37.292627

But no, this is the conference of the perpetrators representing more than 1600 fossil fuel lobbyists given access to COP30. It is unethical to give access to these Big Polluters that continue a road of ecocide, terracide and genocide against Mother Earth, Father Sky, nature and humanity. It is immoral to call this the Indigenous Peoples Cop when local Indigenous Peoples are forced to lift their voices to gain entry when the fossil fuel lobbyists can freely waltz in with no struggle. Pim Sullivan-Tailyour from the UK Youth Climate Coalition said: To achieve a just transition, we must create the conditions by which fossil fuels can no longer have the social license to continue business as usual, making billions in profit, dwarfing the climate finance countries are scrambling to agree on.

1h ago 16.15 GMT Fiona Harvey View image in fullscreen President Andre Correa do Lago holds a toddler during an indigenous protest at COP30 Photograph: Pablo Porciúncula/AFP/Getty Images The sight of Andre Correa do Lago, president of Cop30, holding the baby of one of the protestors outside the conference centre on Friday morning, amid a heavy military presence and tense crowds, will surely be one of the abiding images of the Belem Cop. The veteran Brazilian diplomat has been playing the same conciliatory role, minus infant, within the conference halls. Delegates are stuck on the “big four” issues that emerged as countries tried to agree an agenda last Sunday, before the start of the two weeks of talks. Do Lago’s idea was to hive off these issues - on climate finance; trade; transparency; and how to address the inadequacy of nations’ recently submitted national climate plans - into a separate set of “presidency consultations”, so that the rest of agenda could continue. Now Brazil has gone a step further, by invoking the language of love and healing, to try to unstick the snarled-up consultations. Delegates were reassured that the sessions were a “safe space”, where they could talk freely of their feelings about the contentious issues. They should think of the sessions not as negotiations but as “therapy”, where they would be listened to with empathy. Do Lago wants parties to send him “love letters” - confidential missives, to be read only by the presidency, in which delegations can set out frankly their real feelings on the conduct of the negotiations and the issues, their fears and their hopes. This is a new approach for Cops, where the restatement of entrenched positions is always far more likely than any kind of insight or forward movement. But perhaps if negotiators can be encouraged to try to process the anger, grief and trauma of the last 29 Cops, they will be in better psychological shape to make some kind of progress at this one.

2h ago 16.01 GMT Oliver Milman View image in fullscreen Maina Vakafua Talia, climate minister of Tuvalu Photograph: Oliver Milman/The Guardian Of all the representatives from 193 countries present at crucial UN climate talks in Brazil, only one has summoned the courage to take the stage and publicly denounce the absent and hostile Trump administration – the climate minister of tiny Tuvalu.



On Monday, Maina Vakafua Talia told leaders and diplomats at the Cop30 summit that Trump had shown a “shameful disregard for the rest of the world” by withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement.



At a gathering where Trump has loomed large despite refusing to send a US delegation to Belem, Talia’s public rebuke is in stark contrast to mostly private murmurings from delegations aghast at attempts by America to halt climate action but wary of potential retribution from the White House.



“We can’t remain silent while our islands are sinking, we can’t remain silent while our people are suffering,” Talia told the Guardian. Tuvalu is a nation of atolls and reef islands in the south Pacific and is considered acutely vulnerable to sea level rise and fiercer storms caused by the climate crisis.



“The US has withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement and I think that’s a shameful thing to do,” he said. “We look to the US for options, for peace, but it seems they are going in the opposite direction and we should hold them accountable. Just because the US is a bigger country doesn’t mean we have to be silent. What matters to us is our survival.”



While other countries have been afraid to speak out, Talia doesn’t hold such anxieties, pointing out the Trump administration has already cut climate adaptation funding for his island nation. He said that he watched Trump’s speech to the UN in September, where the US president called the climate crisis a “con job”, and said he found it “entertaining.”



“The president is imposing sanctions, levies - for us, we have nothing to trade with the US,” Talia, who was wearing a geometric shirt and traditional islander teuga when we chatted. “This is a moral crisis. He has a moral duty to act, the world is looking at him, looking at the US.



“We listen to the president of the United States, we looked to find hopes and options but what we got was doom. It was condemning us and our ability to survive. We need the US in the equation, we need them to engage.” Share

The African continent is on the frontlines of the climate crisis, she noted. “I’m here to for justice for my people, and also to highlight the atrocities in Sudan for everyone,” she said. The ongoing war in Sudan has been exacerbated by the climate crisis, particularly the cycle of flooding and drought - a hallmark of global warming. It’s not the only part of Africa being ravaged by climate and conflict, she noted: violence in the Congo has also been linked to environmental devastation. At Cop, she is calling on leaders to make those connections. “We can’t address climate justice without addressing war,” she said. “We need leaders to see that.” Share Updated at 14.15 GMT

4h ago 13.56 GMT Oliver Milman View image in fullscreen COP30 President Andre Correa do Lago holds a Munduruku Indigenous toddler during a blockade of the conference on Friday. Photograph: Pablo Porciúncula/AFP/Getty Images My colleague Oliver Milman has just filed this report on this morning’s blockade of Cop30. Protesters demanding to speak to Brazil’s president about the plight of the country’s indigenous peoples blockaded the main entrance to the Cop30 venue here in Belem for several hours, eventually leading to an extraordinary meeting with André Corrêa do Lago, the summit’s chief. A group of around 50 people from the Munduruku, an indigenous people in the Amazon basin, blocked the entrance with some assistance from international green groups. Behind them was a huge phalanx of riot police with shields, soldiers and military vehicles. A huge swell of delegates and journalists jostled, sometimes aggressively, around the Munduruku as they sang and chanted, some holding babies or bows and arrows. They brandished signs reading ‘Munduruku indigenous territory is sacred. Enough of the invasion and disrespect’ and ‘No to predatory tourism in the territory of the Munduruku people.’ The group demanded to speak to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva but instead had to settle for do Lago, the tall, amiable Cop president who spent over an hour listening and occasionally talking to the group’s representatives. At one point do Lago held one of the babies. “We demand the presence of president Lula, but unfortunately we are unable to do so, as always,” said one of the protestors. “We were always barred, we were never listened to. Enterprise is being brought without our ears. Every type of venture is being invested without listening to us.” Several protesters said that they were unhappy about their rivers being essentially privatized for commerce by Brazil’s government, a move they see as a threat to their way of life. Others mentioned they were being subjected to deforestation. mining and fish being killed by mercury poisoning. “It’s not a negotiation meeting,” said one protester who spoke to the crowd. “We don’t negotiate the lives of our children, no. Ours was Munduruku. So we’re here to demand and we’re here to fight and know.” She continued to say that “Brazil has a Constitution that does not respect the population” and that the privatization of rivers is “violating the right to our life, our culture and the way of life of the peoples.” She called the river “our lady” and said that “she is life, she is sacred. Nobody’s going to believe it here, bro. Nobody here is going to negotiate mining or work on our land.” do Lago then held the hands of two of the protestors and led the entire group through a scrum of onlookers, some having to be pushed aside by the Munduruku so they could get past. Amid the rather sweaty melee, I was able to get alongside a rather overwhelmed-looking do Lago and asked him what he had told the group. He just said “Yes, yes. I want to help, I want to help.” The Cop president then led the entire Munduruku group to a building separate from the Cop venue, likely a presidential office, that sits behind a tall, secure gate. We will have to wait for the outcome of his talks with the group. The venue has now reopened, albeit with a mass of people waiting in long lines to get in. A UN spokesman called the blockade a “peaceful demonstration” and that people should expect longer wait times. The incident comes after Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief, reportedly raised concerns with the Brazilian hosts about security, as well as air conditioning and the state of delegate offices, at Cop30.

4h ago 13.33 GMT Damian Carrington Norway and the United Arab Emirates - both significant fossil fuel producers - are among the ministerial pairings announced by the Brazilian Cop30 Presidency. The task of the pairings is to consult with countries on specific issues and report their views back to the presidency, to help the negotiations progress. The ministers from Norway and the UAE will work on the “global stocktake”, the strand of the talks about the big gap between the carbon emissions cuts needed and the real world. At its heart is cutting fossil fuel emissions, which makes it a target for obstruction by petrostates. The UAE hosted Cop28 in 2023, which delivered the first ever mention of fossil fuels in a Cop outcome. The pairings match a developing country with a developed one and also include the UK and Kenya, who will work on finance, a critical issue underpinning the whole UN climate process. The UK has been a significant climate donor but declined to contribute to the Tropical Forests Forever Facility launched by Brazil at Cop30. Kenya is a prime mover behind the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force, which is promoting ideas to raise climate funds including taxes on flights and financial transactions. The other pairings are: Gambia and Germany, working on adaptation

Egypt and Spain, working on mitigation, i.e. cutting emissions

Mexico and Poland, working on just transition, i.e. making the switch to a clean economy fair

Australia and India, working on clean technology transfer from rich to poor countries

Chile and Sweden, working on gender, i.e. ensuring climate action addresses gender inequality and empowers women Share

4h ago 13.27 GMT Damian Carrington View image in fullscreen Melting of the the Greenland ice sheet is intensifying because of the continued burning of fossil fuels Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images “We cannot negotiate with the melting point of ice.” That is the striking message on the cover of a report from the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative (ICCI), launched at Cop30 on Thursday evening. The melting of the ice sheets, glaciers and permafrost that make up the planet’s cryosphere is already vast - 30 million tonnes an hour from Greenland alone. It leads to the most profound long-term impact of the climate crisis: sea level rise that will drown cities and towns that sit on the world’s coastlines. Pam Pearson, ICCI director, is blunt: “The damage to coastal and downstream communities is already tragic, but only the beginning. A child born today and living 2-3 metres above sea-level will almost certainly lose their home within their lifetime if current emissions continue. Within the lifetimes of their own great-great grand-children – by 2300 – that might rise to 15 metres if we do not course-correct by phasing out fossil fuels.” “Either global leaders and the public still do not understand the scale of threat from cryosphere loss, or have become resigned to such global destruction,” she says. António Guterres, UN secretary general has warned that rising seas threaten “a mass exodus of entire populations on a biblical scale”. The report says that global temperature rise will have to be returned to 1C next century to slow ice melting and sea-level rise to rates that allow feasible adaptation and minimise the damage. “There are feasible pathways that address the root fossil-fuel causes of global warming, and halt the current global insanity that would lock in thousands of years of human suffering and species loss” the report says. “All involve the phase out of fossil fuel use: first of coal (2040s), then gas (2050s), then oil (2060s),” the report says. “After that, feasible methods of carbon dioxide removal [from the atmosphere] can bring down temperatures to as low as 1.2°C – lower than today’s temperatures. By 2150, we can be below the 1C mark that major findings published this year indicate as the true safe planetary boundary for both ice sheets and mountain glaciers.” Share

4h ago 13.15 GMT Fiona Harvey Back inside the conference my colleague Fiona Harvey has this on the state of the negotiations. In a sign of how tough the negotiations are on the four issues on which the presidency is taking special consultation, the official negotiating hours were extended on Thursday night to 9pm in Belem, with a similar extension due for Friday night. In practice, talks could go on much later on Friday as Brazil strives to achieve progress in the consultations ahead of a stocktake session on Saturday, at which the presidency is supposed to have resolved the question of how to proceed on each of the four thorny issues. The four are: finance, and the interpretation of Article 9.1 of the Paris agreement which requires developed countries to provide climate finance to the poor world; trade, in particular “unilateral trade measures”, such as the EU’s green tariffs; transparency, focusing on the biennial transparency reports that must be filed by all parties under the Paris agreement; and the key question of how to deal with the fact that the current crop of nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which set out how far and how fast countries will cut their greenhouse gas emissions, are inadequate to stay within the 1.5C global heating threshold set out at Paris. Parties must decided on how to adopt these matters into formal agenda items and move forward with them, or drop them. On the plus side, however, as Brazil hived these difficult questions into separate consultations, the negotiations on the rest of the agenda can proceed - if delegates are able to make their meetings on time, as the protests outside have disrupted entry.

4h ago 13.04 GMT Fiona Harvey View image in fullscreen Very low water levels at Woodhead Reservoir in Longdendale, UK which has had its driest start to the year since 1976 Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Disasters such as droughts, floods and the spread of pests have cost the world more than $3 trillion in losses to agriculture over the past three decades, much of it worsened by the climate crisis, new research has found. Nearly 5bn tonnes of cereals, about 3bn tonnes of fruit and vegetables, and close to 1 billion tonnes of meat and dairy produce were destroyed in total by disasters between 1991 and 2023, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN. Nearly $100bn a year was lost, which was about 4% of global GDP from the agriculture sector over the period, according to the report entitled The Impact of Disasters on Agriculture and Food Security 2025. Nearly half of the losses afflicted Asia, amounting to about $1.5 trillion in damage. The Americas accounted for about a fifth of the global share, more than $700bn. Africa suffered less in terms of the value of its products – about $700bn in total over the period – but this was the highest proportionally to the size of its economy, resulting in a loss of more than 7% to the continent’s GDP. The FAO report found: “In economies where agriculture accounts for a significant share of employment and income, these losses have had severe consequences for food security and rural stability.” Marine heatwaves, which have been intensified by the climate crisis, have also damaged fisheries: about 15% of global fisheries have been affected, with $6.6bn in losses between 1985 and 2022. Qu Dongyu, director general of the FAO, wrote in the foreword: “The findings presented here call for urgent action from all stakeholders. Governments must integrate disaster risk reduction into agricultural policies and investments. The private sector must engage in partnerships that ensure equitable access to digital innovations. Development partners must shift resources from emergency response to anticipatory action and resilience-building. And the international community must recognise that investing in agricultural resilience is not a cost but a foundation for sustainable development, peace and prosperity.” Share

5h ago 12.15 GMT Dharna Noor Today, the international youth climate group Fridays for Future are holding a global climate strike in cities across the world. I met the organizers of the march in Belém early this morning by the city’s port as they prepared for the strike. Among the first to arrive: Sueley Cavalcante, a 26-year-old Fridays for Future organizer and art history student. She came to Cop from Sao Paolo, Brazil. “We have to face a lot of contractions at this Cop,” she told me. The biggest one, she said, is the exploitation of resources taking place to make the conference happen. “Brazil wants to be considered a global climate leader but they just do this to show off. It’s just discourse,” she said. “They cannot do that while opening new oil exploration. For us, doing this Cop in the most sensitive zone in the Atlantic is even worse.” Read more about those concerns here. Officials say the oil exploration will create jobs for families who need them, but oil jobs require a lot of technical expertise and experience, Cavalcante told me. “The oil is not going to help those families,” she said. Fridays for Future is the “first contact” many young Brazilians have with activism, said Cavalcante. “Fridays for Future is an invitation for young [people] to discover themselves, to discover that if they care about climate there are so many ways for them to get involved.” View image in fullscreen Luca Ernemann a German youth climate protesters Photograph: Dharna Noor/The Guardian Luca Ernemann from German youth climate organization Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union has come to the youth strike to pressure governments to do more on climate. “Cops happen, but emissions go up. Our governments have to make real solutions and have more ambitions especially on the NDCs,” he said. (That’s Cop-talk for “nationally determined contributions, or countries’ plans to curb carbon pollution.”) Share

6h ago 11.51 GMT My colleague Dharna Noor has this update on the day ahead. Negotiations at Cop30 are moving along, but it has become clear which issues will become major sticking points. Among those problems: trade, transparency regarding emissions reporting and finance, and the need for countries to regularly submit action plans (known in Cop-talk as “nationally determined contributions”) to draw down planet-heating pollution. We’re hoping to have an update on these challenges on Saturday from Brazilian officials. Parties are also working through disagreements on finance for adaptation to the climate crisis. But Cop is not merely about politicians’ negotiations. This year, the conference has also sparked a colorful array of events held by civil society groups. “That’s where it’s really all happening,” Susana Muhamad, former environment minister for Colombia, told my colleague Jon Watts and I on Wednesday evening. Friday will bring the continuation of the people’s summit, where movements from around the world are holding events focused on promoting climate justice. There, the programming, put together by 1,100 organizations, is focused on themes such as land and food sovereignty, environmental racism, the need for climate policy to uplift workers, the preservation of democracy, sustainable and just development, and gender equity. Meanwhile, youth in Belem and around the world will hold a climate strike demanding the swift and justice-oriented phaseout of fossil fuels. Follow the blog to see our coverage! The issues being raised during Cop, both inside and outside the negotiations, may seem too vast to grasp. But remember: the climate crisis is reshaping every facet of society. The UN’s top climate science body told us back in 2019 that averting climate catastrophe will require “unprecedented changes across all aspects of society”.

Shortly after midnight air raid sirens sounded and residents made their way to shelters or lay between two walls in their apartments. Soon afterwards the whine of Shahed drones could be heard in the sky, with heavy machine gun fire from Ukrainian air defences.

Ukraine’s president said the country was hit by 430 drones and 18 missiles. The dead were at home in an apartment block on Kyiv’s left bank when it was hit. Dozens of other buildings were damaged, including the Azerbaijani embassy which was struck by falling debris.

“It was scary. Our windows shook. I thought: ‘Oh God, this is the end,” Bruce Avalord, an American longtime resident, said, speaking outside a wrecked multistorey residential compound. A drone careened into its upper levels at 3am, witnesses said, exploding in a bright orange fireball.

On Friday a bulldozer scooped up glass and bricks which had fallen on the pavement in the Sviatoshynskyi district. Owners checked over broken cars. “There are no military targets here, just civilians. The Russians want people to beg the government to capitulate. The tactic won’t work. Ukrainians are resilient,” Avalord said.

Another local, Valentina, said she threw on her clothes and hid in her ninth-floor corridor next to the lift, staying there until dawn. “The explosions woke me up. It was very loud. There were booms everywhere. I was messaging friends to see if they were OK,” she recalled.

Zelenskyy called on Europe and the US to supply additional air defence systems and to impose further sanctions on Russia’s oil industry. He said Ukraine was taking its own measures to prevent attacks by hitting Russian energy targets using home-produced deep-strike missiles.

He disclosed that “Long Neptune” missiles had been used for the first time, after a successful Ukrainian aerial operation on the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, an important oil export facility. He called the attack “our entirely just response to Russia’s ongoing terror.”

During his last trip to the White House in October, Zelenskyy asked Donald Trump for long-range Tomahawk missiles. Speaking to the Guardian last week he said the meeting – contrary to reports – was a success. So far, though, the US president has refused to provide the weapons, amid warnings from the Kremlin of retaliation.

Oleksandra Matviichuk, Ukraine’s Nobel peace prize laureate, called on EU countries to use their air power to defend Ukraine’s vulnerable skies. She said Trump needed to deliver Tomahawks in order to stop enemy missiles before they were launched from Russian military airfields.

“Our house shook the whole night, but my family is alive. Trump promised that when he becomes president, he will end the Russian war against Ukraine. Putin is demonstratively obstructing all his efforts even simply to cease fire.

“Now it is also Trump’s war. If he does not show strength, he will go down in history as a weak president,” she warned on social media.

Ukraine’s prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko described Friday’s bombardment as “unprecedented”. She said about 30 residential buildings were targeted. Five people were taken to hospital, including a pregnant woman. Several children were hurt.

There was widespread international condemnation. Germany’s defence minister Boris Pistorious said Vladimir Putin had shown “contempt for humanity”.

Russia has upgraded its Iranian-designed kamikaze drones, so they travel faster and are harder to shoot down. Ukraine has responded by developing new drone interceptors. While effective, they are not sufficient to cope with the combined drone and missile swarms now being sent by Moscow.

Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said: “The Russians are hitting residential buildings. There are a great many damaged multistorey apartment buildings in practically every district.”

Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said the capital’s heating system had sustained damage, with service interrupted in one district. He warned of possible disruptions to power and water supplies. Most of the country is experiencing frequent blackouts after a series of Russian attacks this autumn on energy infrastructure.

In the Darnytskyi district, debris landed in the yard of a residential building and on the grounds of an educational facility. A car caught fire after being hit by falling fragments.

In the Dniprovskyi district, debris damaged three apartment buildings, a private household and caused a fire in an open area. In the Podilskyi district, five residential buildings and a nonresidential structure were damaged. Several fires were caused by falling debris elsewhere in the city.

The Kremlin’s latest onslaught came as EU officials warned this week that Ukraine must continue to crack down on corruption after a significant kickbacks scandal that has put top government figures under scrutiny. But Brussels also offered assurances that aid will continue to flow to Kyiv.

On Wednesday Zelenskyy moved to contain public outrage by firing two ministers who were accused of involvement in a large-scale bribery scheme. They deny wrongdoing. He also imposed sanctions on Timur Minduch, a friend and former business partner, who fled Kyiv hours before anti-corruption investigators raided his Kyiv home.",2025-11-14T17:33:41.649950

Disaster Maharashtra floods, 2005

Ruchira Gupta is an English-to-Hindi interpreter, a former lawyer, and mother of two daughters. In 2005, she was working at a small law firm in Mumbai, India when heavy rainfall flooded the country’s western state of Maharashtra, killing 926 people. Between 1950 and 2015, there was a threefold increase in extreme rain events in India.

It was raining that day, and very windy. I was in my office, and one of my colleagues said he had heard on the radio that the trains would stop very soon because the tracks had become flooded. He said, “Ruchira, why don’t you leave?” He knew that I had two daughters and had to relieve my childcare by 6pm.

Immediately, I collected my bag and umbrella and called my husband. I didn’t know what was happening. My colleague advised me not to sit in the ladies’ coach on the train (in Mumbai we have a separate coach for ladies). He said, “You’d better go in the general coach, because if something happens you will have the support of other people there.”

The station was about 10 minutes from my office. Rain was hitting my body. My umbrella was useless in that wind and rain. A lot of water was already on the road. I remember my lower legs, feet and shoes were wet by the time I reached the station.

There were a lot of people, a lot of noise, at Churchgate station; everyone wanted to catch a train and go home. There were public announcements about train services getting affected. I walked on board and sat down in the last train leaving the station. It was crowded and moved very slowly because of the water on the tracks. The roof of the coach was leaking, so we were all sitting with open umbrellas inside the coach. After five or six stations, the train stopped at Bandra, where it was announced that the train would not move further because of the flooding on the tracks.

There were still quite a few people at the station. I got out of the train and crossed the bridge, over the platform, to reach the road. It was raining very heavily, and on the bridge you could feel the rain and the wind more. I couldn’t open my eyes. I was not wearing a raincoat. I just had my bag, which I clung tightly to my body to give me some warmth. I was already almost all wet. There were still quite a few people at the station.

I crossed the bridge, thinking, “What should I do?” Home was still another four to five stations away, and then I would need to take a bus or taxi from the train station. My husband’s office, Bandra Kurla Complex, was in the vicinity, so I called him from a public phone. He said, “My office is closing early. People are scared about the floods. The buses will be leaving soon to take us home. Come to my office and we will go together.”

I started walking, hoping to find a taxi or an autorickshaw to take me to his office, but there were none. I continued walking, I don’t remember how far. I reached a big intersection going towards the Bandra Kurla Complex. The rains were very heavy and it was difficult to walk; the water on the roads was ankle-deep. I stopped a truck and told the driver I needed to go to Bandra Kurla Complex. There was a gas station nearby, and he said, “I can drop you there.”

From there I started walking towards my husband’s office, across the road. It was a considerable distance because the roads were very broad. The water there was about knee-deep, but I continued walking.

Slowly, the water came up to my waist, but I continued walking as if I wasn’t aware. I did not even think about if there were any loose electric wires or open drains in the middle of the road. I just continued walking.

Opposite my husband’s office there were cars floating in the water. I felt amused at first; then I felt fear. I reached my husband’s office, where the buses were parked, waiting to take people to their homes. Some buses which had left earlier started to come back. The roads were all flooded, so there was no way they could go further.

It was 5 or 6pm already. My daughters were alone at home with the caregiver. A friend of mine lived in another residence complex some distance away from mine. I could not connect to her, but I knew if I sent my daughters to her she would take care of them. But you had to walk up a small slope to reach her place. I told my helper to take the children to my friend’s place. She said there was no way they could, because the water was coming down from the slope at very high speed. They would have drowned in that water.

I called the wife of my husband’s colleague, who lived in the same complex. I don’t take favours easily from anyone. But I had no choice; I had to ask for a favour. I asked my helper, “Drop them to this madam’s place”. My oldest was six. My younger one was just three. I spoke with my daughters on the phone. I started crying. My oldest said, “Don’t worry, mama. We’ll be fine. I’ll take care of her.” Then I talked to my youngest. She was like, “No mama, I want you. Mama, come home. When will you come home?” That was very traumatic for me. I was relieved that they would not be alone at home and would be with family. I was praying that my daughters would remain safe. I am a strong believer in prayers.

After settling my daughters, I was OK. I felt very cold, because I was drenched and there was air conditioning in the office. There used to be a canteen there, so the staff broke open all the cupboards and whatever they could find, they tried to cook. Since food was limited, it was rationed out so that everyone could get something to eat, as we were not aware how long this would last. One spoon of rice, one spoon of dal.

We tried to make ourselves comfortable. There was a big hallway. There were some couches there and my husband and I sat on one couch; other people also sat on couches, or went back to their cubicles. The roads were still flooded the next day; no transportation was working. Some people went out and tried to reach home, but came back. There was muddy water everywhere. We were in the office the whole day.

My niece called me. She was living with us in Mumbai, interning with a law firm. I did not know whether she was in her office or out somewhere trying to reach home, stuck in the floods. She told me she had slept in the office the first night and then walked home. It took her two to three hours. I told her, “Please get my daughters home and keep them with you. Give them food.”

On the third day the rains stopped, but the water was still on the roads. There was no food and I needed my inhaler. I’m asthmatic, and was not carrying my inhaler in my bag. I was having difficulty breathing. There was a hospital just across the road. My husband could not walk in the water, because he had some injury on his foot. He said: “There’s no rain now. See if you can go to the hospital and get medicines from the pharmacy.”

Nothing had been done by the civic authorities to clean up the roads. It was all kichir (muddy slush). I managed to reach the hospital. Inside, there were a lot of staff, doctors and nurses. I went to the pharmacy, bought the medicines, and then saw the canteen.

Of course, I was hungry, and I knew there was no more food in the office. I asked if I could also get some food. I said, “I’ve come from this office. I’m hungry and I need to take my medicines, so please can I get some food?” I don’t think I can explain the emotions I went through. I started to cry.

I realised the humiliation and the helplessness of begging for food. They were considerate. I got some food from them. I came back to the office and told my husband, “I got food there. I’m glad that there’s one person less for the office to give food to.”

That evening it was decided: “Let us venture out and try to go back home.” The people who had cars made carpools. It was decided that my husband and I would travel in two different cars, because even if one car got stuck somewhere or something happened at least one of us would still be safe and could reach home. We did not know what to expect out on the roads. It was very scary. Would we encounter more water? The buses were stuck on the road. There were no lights on the streets. A lot of responsibility was on the driver. Filth and mess was everywhere.

I think I reached home first. I was relieved to have made it back safely, for my daughters. There was no electricity, no running water. As Mumbai had a regular electricity supply, we had no candles at home. The water could not be pumped, so we had to carry water up from the ground floor. We were living on the third or fourth floor.

Electricity was restored one or two days after I reached home. Then the newspapers started coming. The stories were so sad and so scary. People drowned in cars. People left home to bring their children from school and drowned in maintenance holes. Electric wires broke from the poles and fell into the water, so people were electrocuted.

For the next year I avoided going to work if it was raining heavily. I was scared of leaving my daughters alone at home again. I’m traumatised. I’m afraid to go out if it rains heavily. I had not realised it until recently. I make it a point that my husband informs me that he has reached office safely and at what point he’s leaving the office. Even small things worry me now.

At the time, there was no mention of climate change. Now, when I look back, I know this is the result of climate change. It has been creeping up on us slowly, and now it is there for everyone to realise. Climate change is happening around us. Each one of us has a role in it. The only hope we have is the youth and the children. They’re trying to bring more awareness, to pressurise governments to take positive action.

I haven’t seen much change since the floods. Life went on quite like normal after that. I feel sad about it. I feel sad about all the lives that were lost. I feel sorry. No one was willing to take responsibility. I felt we were completely deserted and left to our own fate. People have to take responsibility.

But this week the strain of trying to be the closest security ally to a freewheeling White House has begun to show.

Britain, it emerged, had quietly suspended intelligence cooperation with the US in the Caribbean because London does not consider the deadly US military campaign against ships accused of drug trafficking to be in line with international law.

That amounts to an extraordinary open fissure in a close working relationship at a time when the US is increasing its military buildup, expanding its controversial campaign in the region with an attempt to threaten Venezuela.

“I’m not sure if there is a previous example of this happening in the public domain. Turning off the tap completely is pretty rare,” said Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank and a former civil servant.

“I suspect when the first boat was blown up, somebody from the UK would have sought clarification from the US along the lines of ‘can you explain what you are doing’. Maybe they got an answer from the Pentagon and didn’t like it.”

Intelligence, once the province of spies, is today increasingly a matter of sophisticated listening and snooping apparatus and surveillance technology. What the UK – and the other Five Eyes members: Australia, Canada and New Zealand – can offer to the US is global coverage, from strategic locations such as the UK base at Akrotiri in Cyprus and island territories in the Caribbean.

The UKUSA relationship may date back to the second world war but it was reforged after 9/11, when Tony Blair promised to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the US, and ran throughout the long “war on terror”, with the Americans in the lead and at times straining at the rules.

There were no shortage of controversies – most notably that members of the UK’s spy agencies saw or had knowledge of CIA torture and kidnap of terror suspects – but politically these were contained. Plans to hold a judge-led public inquiry into alleged UK complicity in torture were finally abandoned by Theresa May as prime minister in 2019.

The UK halted some intelligence sharing during Barack Obama’s US presidency amid British concerns over the legality of certain CIA drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere but the two sides managed to find a way to achieve legal alignment after much effort, said one former official.

Since the return of Donald Trump, however, there have been signs that the alignment is unravelling. In June, as it became clear that the US was considering bombing the Fordow nuclear enrichment site in Iran during the short Israel-Iran war, questions were raised about whether the UK would consider the attack legal.

It was relevant because there was an expectation that the US would launch the B-2 bombing raid from the UK base on Diego Garcia, in the southern Indian Ocean, so forcing Keir Starmer’s government to take a view on the attack’s legality. But the issue was tactfully sidestepped: the US launching the attack from Missouri instead.

While the UK intelligence community is relatively tight, eager to avoid political controversy, and leaks are rare, the US system is larger, leakier and – particularly in Trump’s second term – highly politicised. Because of the close relationship, where so much is shared, the UK is frequently dragged in.

This week a report in the New York Times, sourced partly to former US officials, gave an account of how MI5 was surprised when Kash Patel, the FBI chief, went back on a verbal commitment he had given to the MI5 director general, Ken McCallum. Patel had said he would not cut a surveillance post in London that MI5 deemed critical, only for it to be axed in budget cuts a few weeks later, leaving the British agency incredulous.

Normally where the UK has security or legal concerns about a partner, even one as close as the US, ministers, officials and lawyers can quietly restrict the flow of intelligence, recognising that policy disagreements or leaks are more likely.

However, the Trump administration’s rapidly escalating campaign against alleged narco-traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific has stretched legality to what many experts consider its breaking point – and given the UK no choice but to consider its position on intelligence sharing explicitly.

So far the US has declared that 75 people have been killed in 19 strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific since September, and the White House has justified the campaign on the grounds that it is engaged in “a non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels designated by Trump as terrorists.

However, experts have been questioning the legality of the sinkings since the moment they began, because the US is neither in a state of war with drug cartels nor under imminent threat of armed attack from them.

“The eventual arrival of drugs for sale in the United States is neither an attack nor an imminent threat of attack, and the availability of interdiction means that the use of force was not necessary,” a group of experts wrote on the Just Security blog.

Nevertheless, the UK, always careful not to upset the US, did not go public with concerns. Instead, the decision to pause intelligence sharing, taken more than a month ago, emerged via a leak and a report by CNN. Even then, the UK declined to comment – though the Ministry of Defence’s failure to deny the report has been taken as confirmation of its accuracy.

Dominic Grieve, the UK attorney generalbetween 2010 and 2014, said he believed Britain had taken the only decision it could. “I am not surprised at all. There is no legal basis for killing people in this way. They can be brought to justice and are not an imminent threat to life,” he said.

Legality is critical because if the UK considers the actions of any ally illegal in a conflict, it should not provide it with intelligence assistance. Otherwise it loses legitimacy and is likely to be drawn into the courts, as has happened in the string of cases where the UK was been accused of complicity in rendition and torture.

A question now is the degree of political fallout, coming at a moment when the US-UK relationship is already strained by Trump’s threat to sue the BBC. Some experts, such as Lawrence Freedman, an emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, are optimistic.

“I’m not sure if the US administration will want to make a big fuss because there are already correctly doubts in Congress about the legality of the operation,” Freedman said, adding that drawing attention to the views of the current UK attorney general, Starmer’s ally Richard Hermer, “may feed that debate”.

Others, such as Savill, believe there has to be a quiet rethink as the Trump administration weighs its next move in the Caribbean and against Venezuela. “It is not just business as normal with this US administration. The UK is going to have think much more carefully about how it supports the US – though it will not want to get into public slanging matches with a potentially thin-skinned president,” Savill said.",2025-11-14T17:33:48.087062

If you know the answer to this question (see below), you are probably one of hundreds of thousands of Brits who attend a pub quiz every week.

As a nation of committed trivia buffs, it was unsurprising that news of a quizmaster in Manchester outing a team for cheating was leapt on. Just where, we asked, is the special place in hell reserved for those quizzers who take a sneaky look at their phones under the table?

According to the BBC, a “massive whodunnit” ensued after the landlord at the Barking Dog in Urmston revealed that the cheats were whispering questions into their smartphones, but refused to name and shame them.

It is a misdemeanour that is, according to some quizmasters, an increasingly common blight on one of the nation’s favourite pastimes.

“I think it’s definitely more prolific now, especially with smartwatches – even if you don’t have a phone in your hand, there’s still a way for you to be able to cheat,” said David Hartley, a quizmaster from Staffordshire.

The 33-year-old has hosted quizzes in four venues for nearly a decade and started banning devices about two years ago. “It just takes the mickey out of your quizmaster, if all you’re going to do is sit on your phone,” he said.

David Moyce, the landlord and quizmaster at the Alma in Cambridge, said he recently had to ban a group of students who won in suspicious circumstances. He had suspected cheating after the painfully weak team suddenly played their “joker” – which doubles points – before a round in which they got every question right.

“There was no proof. But then one of the gentlemen came back, handed over some money and said: ‘Yeah, we did cheat,’” Moyce said. “The guilt must have been so heavy on him that he literally handed his share of the money back. None of the others did though, so maybe he slept better than the other four.”

Some pubs have taken hi-tech measures to stop cheats, such as hosting smartphone quizzes where participants have to type in answers on their phones – and lose points if they suspiciously click away from the dedicated quizzing app to use another.

The SpeedQuizzing app promises to see off “the cheats and the chancers” by giving users only 10 seconds per question to lock in their answers in an attempt to restore what it calls “a once proud British tradition”.

Others take more traditional routes. The Prince of Wales in Highgate, north London, has a fiercely peer-policed quiz, according to Marcus Berkmann, who has competed in it more than 200 times and now regularly writes its questions.

“We’re very harsh on anyone who cheats, so no one does it,” said Berkmann, who is the author of A Matter of Facts: The Insider’s Guide to Quizzing. “The regulars would rather boil themselves in oil than cheat.

“Occasionally, you read out a warning and say: ‘We’re testing you on what you know, not what you can look up on Google,’ and people generally go along with that.”

The precise origins of the pub quiz are shrouded in a pre-smoking-ban haze, but they became popular in the 1970s, boosted by Sharon Burns and Tom Porter, whose company Burns and Porter supplied quizzes as a way for pubs to lure drinkers in on quieter nights.

Today, quizzing in the UK remains a serious business, marrying as it does the great British pastimes of drinking and taking pleasure in being right. According to a 2023 survey commissioned by the brewer Greene King, 70% of people regularly take part in a pub quiz and almost one in 10 goes every single week.

Quizmasters could be forgiven for wanting to return to the simpler times of Burns and Porter, but can also take some solace in knowing that their predecessors also had to deal with cheats.

Gail Taylor, for example, responded to a Guardian callout this week to finally come clean about her youthful cheating in Sheffield pubs in the 1980s.

According to Taylor, she planted rudimentary bugging devices underneath pub tables to transmit the questions to encyclopedia-armed friends in a van outside.

The Guardian could not independently verify her tale, but she insisted it was true. “Something always went wrong,” Taylor said. “If the signal didn’t work, we’d write the questions down, rush out to the van with two pints and a list, then someone else would go out and bring back the answers. Nobody seemed to catch on what we were doing.”

Reflecting on the crime more than three decades later, Taylor is entirely without remorse. “We didn’t have Google then, so we never won anything anyway,” she says. “I don’t feel guilty about it at all. And if I had the chance, I’d do it again tomorrow.”

42d55b81ae5defce95ef77a8020d65dbdae25c8f,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/nov/14/anna-wintour-last-vogue-cover-conde-nast,How Anna Wintour’s Vogue front covers made a statement to the end,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 15:11:45 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"During her 37-year tenure as editor-in-chief of American Vogue, Anna Wintour has presided over more than 400 covers. December 2025’s, on newsstands this week, will prove her last before she steps away to focus on roles as Vogue’s global editorial director and chief content officer at Condé Nast.

The cover is certainly memorable: an image of the actor Timothée Chalamet photographed by Wintour’s long-term collaborator Annie Leibovitz in a Celine white polo neck, long cream coat and embroidered jeans, standing on a “planet” with a backdrop of a star-filled nebula provided by Nasa.

It has had something of a negative reception online. On Vogue’s Instagram, comments under the post include “I’m just horrified. It’s offensive with the budgets you have”, and “when you ask ChatGPT to do your cover”.

“It’s weird,” says Jeremy Leslie, the founder of magazine store magCulture. “It’s so weird that after your initial ick, you start thinking, ‘well, but maybe she knows something that I don’t know’, but God help me, I don’t know what that is.”

There is an argument that the Chalamet image sits in the lineage of Wintour’s Vogue covers – with Leibovitz behind the lens and artistic references.

Part of the shoot features the actor in front of City, a land artwork by Michael Heizer in the Nevada desert, and the cover – to those familiar – wittily posits Chalamet, the prince of Hollywood, as The Little Prince, paying homage to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s classic illustration of a boy on the moon, for the cover of the 1943 book.

It has certainly got people talking – and that has been a consistent thread across Wintour’s covers. Her first for US Vogue paired Guess jeans with a Christian Lacroix sweater, a mix of high-low that was radical – and controversial – for a mainstream luxury fashion magazine in 1988. This was followed by images that defined their era: a post-scandal Madonna a year later, supermodels in 1992, a teenage Britney Spears with an American flag in 2001, Michelle Obama as a new first lady in 2009, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian on the eve of their wedding in 2014 and Beyoncé in a flower crown in 2018.

There were also moments that were criticised. The 2008 cover with LeBron James and Gisele Bündchen was seen as placing James in a racist King Kong trope with Bündchen as the defenceless white woman. The 2010 feature and shoot with Asma al-Assad, the wife of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, was regarded as a misjudged puff piece. The Beyoncé cover in 2018 was long overdue in being the first in the magazine’s history to be taken by a Black photographer, 23-year-old Tyler Mitchell. Meanwhile, the recent Lauren Sánchez Bezos cover was seen as a tone-deaf celebration of the mega rich.

“Overall, Anna has played it very safe,” says Amy Odell, the author of Anna: The Biography and writer behind the Back Row substack. “But she’s poked the bear strategically and smartly. She has said you can’t do a controversial crazy cover every single month, but every so often you need to do it to keep people on their toes.”

With Chloe Malle now responsible for covers as the head of editorial content at Vogue – there is no longer an editor-in-chief position – it is her task to explore what becomes a talking point in 2026. Leslie believes Chalamet is a hard act to follow.

“I can’t help feeling that this cover is a huge statement,” he says. “Anna chucking her gloves on the floor and saying, ‘Go on then’, because it is an extraordinary cover, and it’s unlike any other Vogue cover.”

Odell says Malle will have the challenge of who fits Vogue’s idea of wealth and aspiration now. “[It used to be] you could photograph the heirs to a frozen food fortune on their yacht somewhere and be like, ‘they have such amazing style’. Now it’s nepo babies, it’s Lauren Sánchez, and people don’t find it tasteful any more … when they’re viewed as the American oligarchy, it offends people in a way that I don’t think it did for most of [Wintour’s] tenure.”

The new era could, however, mean less Wintour-style talking point covers full stop. “Times have changed,” says Leslie. “Condé Nast used to relish having these star editors … they’re more worker bees [now]. So in that respect, perhaps Chloe’s not going to look to make a statement.”

Wintour’s own focus could now turn to Vogue World. The series of Vogue-branded fashion shows, which began in 2022, have different themes across different cities. The latest – Vogue Hollywood – featured stars such as Kendall Jenner and Nicole Kidman in an event raising money for the victims of the LA wildfires. Next up is Milan, with Vogue World focusing on craftsmanship, taking place in the Italian city in September 2026.",2025-11-14T17:33:51.722490
1a6e4111ee3f8714d42d0735bbac035c9a6dad22,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/14/vybz-kartel-interview-dancehall-jamaica-prison,"Vybz Kartel on his legal battles, vulgar lyrics and the lasting scars of prison: ‘If I hear a key shake, it traumatise me’","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:00:40 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"There’s a moment when I’m interviewing Vybz Kartel in the courtyard of the Four Seasons hotel in Tower Bridge, London, and the UK government emergency alert test rings on my phone. He is panicked by it and jumps up. “Me ready fi run you know!” he says, which has us both laughing.

It is a funny moment, but also a jolting one considering that it arrives in the middle of him discussing the lasting psychological effects of prison. Kartel, 49, real name Adidja Palmer, had been incarcerated across different institutions in Jamaica following his conviction for the 2011 murder of his associate Clive “Lizard” Williams. Following a lengthy appeal process, he was released in July last year after the ruling was overturned by the UK privy council (which is the final court of appeal for Jamaica due to the nation being a former British colony).

At the time of his arrest, Kartel was one of the biggest dancehall stars in Jamaica’s history. He emerged in 2003 with the album Up 2 Di Time, serving up provocation, badness and a rapid-fire rhythmic “toasting” vocal style that was both gravelly and versatile. Influenced by grittier DJs such as Ninjaman, it was a stylistic departure from the more mellifluous “singable” reggae sound of Bob Marley and Peter Tosh. A succession of hits, from the erotic duet Romping Shop with Spice in 2009 to the foot-stomping Clarks in 2010 and the vibrant Summer Time in 2011, aided Kartel’s crossover to the British and American charts.

By the early 2010s he had more than laid claim to the King of Dancehall title that was hitherto bestowed on Beenie Man. But today he’s a reminder that kings often experience moments of profound disturbance. Speaking of life after prison, he tells me: “My sleeping habits have changed … if I hear a key shake, it traumatise me”; the wardens would jingle them before a head count of prisoners. He “went hard” on smoking and drinking when he was released and both remain a crutch. Despite this, he refuses therapy: “I understand what I’m going through and I just let it work itself out.”

It is humbling to witness Kartel this vulnerable. He is not a shrinking violet; in fact he is cheerful and cracks jokes. He looks at my pleated black trousers and starts to sing “spray dem like Issey Miyake”, a lyric from his track Empire Army referencing the Japanese fashion designer. But it is evident that prison has shifted something. It is a stark contrast, too, to his public triumphalism. Days before meeting him, I watched him perform at the O2 arena in London. The show began with Kartel performing from a cell, then emerging clad in a sparkling red Givenchy two-piece and launching into recent hit The Comet, which portends his release and has the memorable line “Me fuck yuh madda through di prison grill”.

While there had been an impression that Kartel received celebrity treatment behind bars, the reality is more bleak. In 2014, a doctor diagnosed him with Graves’ disease, an autoimmune condition that was being aggravated by his prison surroundings. Conditions in Jamaica’s Tower Street Adult Correctional Centre were said to be filthy and inhumane, and in the affidavit for his release, Kartel said that he feared dying in prison, as his heart was functioning at 37% of its capacity. “I was in urgent need of medical help that the state could not provide,” he says. On release, his physical health was so bad that at his welcome-home concert in Kingston on New Year’s Eve, he struggled to breathe and walk while performing. A diet of whole foods and green juices has helped support him back to health, and he says he was pleased by his more energetic showing at the O2.

I’m pushing love and unity – shit I should have been doing years ago. But sometimes you pay to learn

Kartel had been one of dancehall’s greatest successes, but he had to watch from prison as it exploded into the mainstream, with the streaming giant Drake using the sound on his 2016 album Views and signing Kartel’s own protege Popcaan to his OVO label. “It didn’t feel good, but I’m a type of person that is gonna find a way,” he says. Kartel released music prolifically from prison. In 2016 alone he released 50 new songs, and Rolling Stone wrote that he “still rules dancehall.”. He cites the global hit Fever, certified gold in the US and silver in the UK, as evidence of how he tapped into the genre’s momentum – all with lyrics recorded in Tower Street on an iPhone 5S.

Of course, Kartel feels that those years in jail unjustly robbed him of much of his life. After being arrested for weed possession in 2011, he found himself kept in custody, charged with the murder of Jamaican businessman Barrington “Bossie” Burton (for which he was acquitted in July 2013), and then the murder of Lizard. I ask if he thinks he was set up. “Of course I was set up, because I’m innocent,” he says. “They always try to pin stuff on me, because they say gangsters, I influence them. [They say] my circle is questionable, which, in their defence, was true.”

When I ask Kartel if his relationship with Lizard had broken down at any point, he says no. But evidence from his 2014 trial, which Kartel faced with three co-defendants (who all pleaded not guilty), paints a different story. According to police, Lizard was killed after allegedly stealing two guns from Kartel and other members of his Portmore Empire crew. The courtroom was then shown messages sent from a mobile device claimed to be Kartel’s, which read: “Tween me an u a chop we chop up the bwoy Lizard fine fine … As long as u live dem can never find him.” Lizard’s body has never been found. These texts read like a confession. Yet lawyers handling Kartel’s appeal maintained that there was evidence of phone tampering.

Kartel is insistent: “I did not kill Lizard … and they know who did what.” He suggests collusion between different Jamaican authorities to topple him. And while the question of Kartel’s guilt remains only in the court of public opinion, it does track that Kartel was a figure that people wanted to see removed from public life. Before his imprisonment, his gunman tunes, vulgar lyrics known as “slackness” and promotion of hate speech were viewed as influencing an epidemic of violence that was sweeping Jamaica.

As was the Gully-Gaza war, a rivalry between Kartel and the dancehall artist Mavado that erupted in violent confrontations. A 2009 article in the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper laments that “the followers of the gun hawks themselves – Vybz Kartel (Gaza) and Mavado (Gully) – are shooting, stabbing up and beating one another”. (He has since reconciled with Mavado, and tells me that their sons attend each other’s birthday parties.) By 2010, Kartel had been banned from entering some Caribbean countries including Grenada, Barbados and St Lucia. Even the deadly Wadando-Gaza gang in Nairobi, Kenya, is said to have drawn inspiration from Kartel.

Today, he says he is “pushing love and unity, shit I should have been doing years ago. But sometimes you pay to learn.” He acknowledges that his previous lyrics contained violence, but he refuses to be scapegoated, saying that his “hardcore” music was a natural consequence of growing up in the ghetto. “The system created that reality for us as ghetto youth. The violence came with politics. The first round of violence that ever reached Jamaica? 1976.” He is referring to the escalation of political violence around the 1976 general election, a year in which there were an estimated 200 political murders.

It was in this year that reggae legend Bob Marley was shot in Kingston, two days before the Smile Jamaica concert that was intended to heal political divisions. It is also the year that Kartel was born. Although Kartel grew up in a two-parent household in Portmore with positive influences, he says that his parents could not watch him every second of the day. “I was born in violence. The streets were always calling. That’s how most ghetto youth get involved in crazy shit.”

He cites the fact that he has, in recent years, received European and American visas as evidence that the world sees he has changed, as “these visas aren’t easy to get”. His first public appearance in the UK after leaving prison was at this year’s Mobo awards, where he was honoured with an Impact award for his influence on music and culture, a far cry from the 2012 awards, where he had his nomination for best reggae act withdrawn after refusing to apologise for homophobic lyrics.

I take the opportunity to ask him about those lyrics and if he has regrets about them, feeling comfortable enough with how generous and warm he is to tell him that I am a gay man. “I do regret it, because culture is powerful,” he says. “What we were doing is mimicking what was said before by entertainers. In Jamaica, we learned a lot of homophobia from the church. Now I would never do that. I think people should live, regardless of who you are or who you’re sleeping with – do your thing!”

People love dancehall. I call it the biggest underground music on the planet

There are other regrets he has, like bleaching his skin (Kartel released a range of skin-lightening cosmetics in 2011). He told himself that he bleached because he wanted his tattoos to show. “In hindsight, I think it was just that colonial mindset that makes Black people think white is right.” He won’t bleach again: “That’s bullshit, man.”

But that anti-colonial mentality is not entirely representative of Kartel’s views. His experience of Jamaica’s justice system has made him not just lose faith in the country, but become an advocate for Britain. As he points out, his Instagram bio features the words “Long live the king” along with a little union flag. He celebrates the UK privy council for delivering justice, rejecting calls for a Caribbean Court of Justice, a demand spearheaded by the Barbadian prime minister Mia Mottley, feeling that Jamaica is “too corrupt. I went through the system and I see it tear people apart that don’t got no money,” he says. “I have money, and look how long it took me to get justice. So no, I’d never support that court of appeal.”

Kartel also keeps his distance from Jamaican politics – supporting neither the ruling Jamaica Labour Party, nor the opposition People’s National Party (PNP). In his 2015 track Pound of Rice he says, “mi ah vote fi di pool party!” He imagines running for office, on a manifesto of “education, sports and entertainment” to serve those who grew up in the ghetto, but is clear that this would only be as an independent, “they would probably try to kill me. I’m not even joking.” Despite this, he is often inadvertently pulled into politics. When he made a surprise appearance at the PNP annual conference last year, it was interpreted as an endorsement, though he says he was only there to support his lawyer, Isat Buchanan, who recently won a seat in parliament. More recently, he condemned naysayers who criticised him for sharing the Jamaican government’s emergency response and recovery effort initiative in the wake of Hurricane Melissa, saying “this is not about politics, it’s about Jamaica”.

These days, Kartel is just trying to stay out of trouble. His main focus is figuring out how to continue expanding the reach of dancehall, seeking collaborations with Afrobeats artists who have broken out globally and striking a balance between commercial appeal and artistic integrity. He wants its tracks to become universal household classics, “like Bob Marley’s One Love – everybody can sing that, but with dancehall it’s like …” – he spits gibberish to communicate the genre’s fast pace. “But people love it. I call it the biggest underground music on the planet. Once we get it to that level where it’s on the playlists globally, we good.”

Mostly though he is embracing freedom. He prays to God every day and he’s due to remove old tattoos of a devil’s head and the 666 symbol as he pursues a cleaner path. He is still struggling with sickness, but he feels good. “I tell you, nothing can ruin my day or my energy. I’ve got a new lease on life.”

The technology, money and strategies have all been at hand for years. What stifles effective action is a deadly conjunction: the climate crisis running headlong into the epistemic crisis.

An epistemic crisis is a crisis in the production and delivery of knowledge. It’s about what we know and how we know it, what we agree to be true and what we identify as false. We face, alongside a global threat to our life-support systems, a global threat to our knowledge-support systems.

Let’s start by recognising that they were never robust. There was no golden age of public knowledge, no moment at which the information most people received was largely unbiased and accurate. Throughout modern history, European societies have formed a broad consensus around blatant falsehoods: such as the view that the monarch embodied all the interests of the nation, that women were unsuited to public life, that Black and Brown people were inferior beings, that empire was a force for good. A vast infrastructure of persuasion was built around these beliefs. Public knowledge is always shaped by power.

The promise of democracy was that the lives of all would steadily improve as knowledge spread: we would turn our gathering understanding of the world into social progress. For a while, in some places, we did. But that era now seems to be coming to an end.

The fundamental problem is this: that most of the means of communication are owned or influenced by the very rich. If democracy is the problem capital is always trying to solve, propaganda is part of the solution. Like the kings and empire-builders of the past, they use their platforms to project the claims that suit them and suppress the claims that don’t. This means boosting right and far-right movements, which defend wealth and power against those who wish to redistribute them.

In the US, we witness a rapid and extreme hardening of this position, as Trump’s allies, old and new, sweep up legacy media platforms – it seems obvious that the result will be ever more unhinged attacks on anyone who challenges capital.

The ultra-rich have also pumped money into new media, such as the online shows that now outrank traditional television news. For example, two fracking billionaires have poured $8m (£6m) into PragerU and $4.7m into the Daily Wire, to extend the reach of these platforms.

Of the world’s 10 most popular online shows, a Yale study shows eight have spread climate science denial. Joe Rogan, who hosts one of the world’s most popular shows, has repeatedly claimed that the Earth is cooling, drawing on research that says the opposite.

A new investigation of Elon Musk’s X by Sky News found that every account set up by reporters, “no matter their political orientation, was fed a glut of rightwing content”, much of which was extreme. The experts it consulted believe this pattern could have resulted only from an algorithm engineered for this purpose, and that “an algorithmic bias must be decided by senior people at the channel”. (X, for its part, told Sky News it was “dedicated to fostering an open, unbiased public conversation”.) A separate study found the spread of misinformation on X is most associated with politicians on the radical right: mainstream or leftist representatives are far less likely to spread falsehoods. The radical right leans heavily into climate science denial and obstruction of environmental measures: this is why it is sponsored by fossil fuel companies.

Capital has willing workers even in the media that aren’t owned by billionaires. A devastating new article by Peter Coviello, professor of American literature at the University of Illinois, records how he and his former college became collateral damage in the campaign waged by the New York Times against Zohran Mamdani, now mayor-elect of New York City. Coviello explains a process grimly familiar to climate scientists: equating expert opinion with commentary from paid lobbyists. No attempt is made to examine “the relation between those two ‘sides,’ or their histories, or their sponsors, or their relative evidentiary authority”. If, he argues, you have the money to fund a junktank, it will produce whatever opinion you request, then papers such as the New York Times will balance that opinion against decades of academic study, as if the two things are of equal weight.

This also describes the BBC’s understanding of “impartiality”. While it no longer provides a platform for outright climate denial, almost every day it breaks its own editorial guidelines by hosting Tufton Street junktanks (which often argue against environmental action) without revealing who funds them. Shouldn’t we be allowed to know whether or not they are sponsored by fossil fuel companies?

The BBC told its presenter Evan Davis to stop making his own podcast about heat pumps, on the grounds that discussing this technology meant “treading on areas of public controversy”. Why are heat pumps controversial? Because the Energy and Utilities Association, which lobbies for gas appliances, paid a public affairs company to make them so. The company, WPR, boasted that it set out to “spark outrage”. The media, BBC included, were all too happy to oblige.

None of this has obliged any BBC executive to resign. Nor did the plan discussed by former director general Tim Davie and former head of news Deborah Turness to alter “story selection and other types of output, such as drama” to “address low trust issues with Reform voters”. Nor did editing an interview with Jeremy Corbyn to produce a misrepresentation far more serious than Panorama’s edit of a speech by Donald Trump. Nor did its mock-up of a Soviet propaganda poster featuring Corbyn, using the classic Stalinist image of a rayed red dawn. I cannot think of an occasion on which anyone at the BBC has had to resign for misrepresenting a leftwinger. But the appeasement of the right never ends, and nor will it ever be satisfied.

In this media climate, it’s not surprising that governments are retreating from climate action. In June, a review by the International Panel on the Information Environment found that “inaccurate or misleading narratives” in the media about climate breakdown create “a feedback loop between scientific denialism and political inaction”. The results can be seen at the current Cop30 climate talks, whose president, André Corrêa do Lago, remarks on a “reduction in enthusiasm” among rich nations.

This is like me apologising for accidentally releasing sex offenders from prison. I suppose there is the occasional previous example in public life. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor apologised for his association with Jeffrey Epstein and gave a woman he’d never met a reported £12m. Perhaps that provides the prime minister with the warming cover of precedent.

If you’re just joining us, this is a week in which the government finally achieved the chaos spiral of several recent Conservative administrations. We can now officially say: same car, different clowns. We are less than two weeks out from the budget, with Friday morning’s Downfall meme being yet another U-turn, with the chancellor reportedly not going ahead with her all-but-confirmed plans to raise basic- and higher-rate income tax. The gilt markets reacted accordingly, if by accordingly we mean “made emergency calls for Andrex” – but then new Treasury briefings insisted it was all actually good news and based on better forecasts.

Seriously, nothing says “budget responsibility” like sending a second budget plan to the Office for Budget Responsibility that rips up the first. You’ll be familiar with the fiscal black hole. This moment could be its event horizon.

Either way, instead of using any of the three serious revenue-raising levers that all serious chancellors know are the ones available to them – income tax, national insurance and VAT – revenue will apparently now be raised by what is being described as a “smorgasbord” of smaller taxes. If you’re picturing one of those gorgeous Instagram charcuterie boards with little chunks of fine cheese and caperberries tucked between prosciutto spirals, please adjust your expectations to a Formica table bearing four half-eaten Babybel and some reconstituted ham still in its packet (use by 31 October 2025). Not pulling the big levers but fiddling around in other ways produces unintended consequences – just like eating ham way after its use-by date does. You might be wondering how many more times Reeves needs to learn this lesson. The answer, evidently, is: more times than she has already learned it in the past year. And that’s a lot of times.

Does Downing Street’s financial drama relegate the briefing drama to this week’s B-plot? Unclear. It’s hard to work out what sort of show Labour thinks it’s writing. Midweek, it seemed to become a procedural, when Starmer announced that he had conducted some kind of personal inquiry into who briefed against Streeting. Admittedly, the world of entertainment has given us a rich tradition of lawyers who turned to the darker world of investigation: Matlock. Perry Mason. Saul Goodman. She-Hulk. But does Keir Starmer really sit among these giants? We can all agree he doesn’t sit in anything approaching “the world of entertainment”.

Certainly, the insane briefing operation was of such staggering ineptitude that its end result was to make Streeting stronger, Starmer even weaker, and the government even more of a mirthless laughing stock. You’ve heard of Abraham Lincoln’s team of rivals. Starmer – arguably more of a political genius – has gone for a team of weevils.

Like many even passingly familiar with the way his administration has done business since it tipped up in Downing Street, I’m trying to picture the PM’s police investigation whiteboard for this political crime. All I’m getting is an entirely empty wall with one picture of (chief of staff) Morgan McSweeney and one picture of (communications chief) Tim Allan on it. We’re all trying to find out who did this, etc.

Starmer seems to have tried to find out by asking some of the suspects and simply believing them when they said they didn’t do it. Or as the prime minister put it: “I have been talking to my team today. I have been assured that no briefing against ministers was done from No 10, but I have made it clear that I find it absolutely unacceptable.” “Done from No 10”? That’s an eye-catching way of putting it. Lawyerly, even. Was briefing by Starmer’s team being done from somewhere else, like the pub? Or maybe his loathed posse of aides are now mainly BFH (briefing from home)? Either way, you should definitely trust Detective Starmer, Attorney at Law, to get to the bottom of it. No stone left unturned. OK, some stones left unturned. OK, most stones, but there are a lot of stones. OK, fine, there are actually only two stones, but he doesn’t like touching stones. Can you be signed off work for not liking touching stones?

If you can, incidentally, please expect the parliamentary Labour party to refuse to consider even means-testing the cost of this benefit. This feels like a problem, because four days ago – four days! – the chancellor told the BBC that “It would of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments [on tax]. But that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.” You’d think, wouldn’t you? Let’s see.

Meanwhile, it has just emerged that Starmer has spent a whole sixth of his premiership overseas. Ironically, the only other Brits who spend this much time abroad are now trying to offshore their tax arrangements. Perhaps the prime minister is trying to get his primary residence listed as “international waters”. After all, if this week has hinted at anything, it is perhaps that he will be changing his primary residence sooner rather than later.",2025-11-14T17:33:59.134345

As negotiators gather in Brazil for Cop30, however, Europe’s leadership risks faltering. Things were very different a decade ago in Paris, when a landmark deal to limit global heating to 1.5C was achieved at Cop21. That agreement relied on an understanding between the US and China – one that would be difficult to replicate today. Its ambition was elevated by Europe acting in concert with a broad coalition of global south countries.

The Paris climate agreement paved the way for the European Green Deal in 2019, which enshrined into law the ambition of climate neutrality in the EU by 2050 and introduced the world’s first comprehensive plan to achieve it, featuring a robust set of pricing, regulatory and funding measures.

Admittedly, not everything was flawless. In envisioning a green future, European politicians failed to account sufficiently for the social impact of the energy transition. The EU’s efforts to engage with and compensate those who stood to lose fell short. Regions and workers reliant on carbon-intensive industries, disadvantaged social groups and poorer countries disproportionately affected by the climate crisis and regressive economic consequences of the transition were all hit. Criticism of these failings is valid, but the EU undeniably backed its commitments with action, putting its money where its mouth was.

Today in Brazil, Europe’s climate leadership could unravel. This is not only because the US has again withdrawn from the Paris agreement and the Trump administration is actively seeking to undermine other countries’ commitments, including those in Europe. Nor is it solely because countries in the global south – from India and Indonesia to the Gulf states and Turkey – refuse to compromise growth for climate, blaming the global north, especially Europe, for the crisis. It is also because Europe itself, gripped by an internal “greenlash”, risks going missing in action.

After the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the dominant narrative around the Green Deal’s potential to drive investment and innovation shifted. Nationalist and far-right groups gained traction as they turned the deal into a bogeyman: an ideological project driven by liberals and the left – wittingly or unwittingly in league with China – to weaken Europe. These forces, alongside entrenched fossil fuel and agricultural lobbies, repeatedly claimed that the Green Deal would cause Europe’s deindustrialisation and allow Beijing to exploit new green interdependencies.

As Hannah Arendt observed decades ago, the more falsehoods are repeated, the more they harden into convictions. Bashing of the Green Deal spread from the political fringes and polluted the centre-right, amplified externally by pressure from the Trump administration and leading gas exporters such as Qatar. Washington and Doha, for instance, threatened to withhold gas shipments unless the EU diluted or abandoned its sustainability reporting requirements. Today, the Green Deal has vanished from the European lexicon, replaced with “competitiveness”, “technological neutrality” and “bureaucratic simplification” alongside defence.

Optimists had hoped this was merely a rhetorical shift to make climate policy more politically palatable. Unfortunately, the reality is more troubling. The EU has significantly weakened its 2040 greenhouse gas reduction plans, embedding review clauses to allow for backsliding at times of economic downturn and relying on scientifically dubious carbon credits.

Unsurprisingly, far-right governments in Italy and central and eastern Europe have led the push for retreat. The EU has also delayed the expansion of its emissions trading scheme to homes and transport, as well as the implementation of its deforestation regulation. It may yet delay or dilute its 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars. Further rollbacks are expected under the guise of bureaucratic simplification, with its “omnibus package” set to undermine sustainability, due diligence and, among other measures, the EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM).

Much of this amounts to Europe shooting itself in the foot. When the EU championed climate leadership, it did so not only out of idealism but also because, as a fossil-fuel-poor continent, its energy security and prosperity depended on it. This is precisely why China, also a hydrocarbon importer, followed Europe’s lead in advancing renewables and green technologies. Yet, while China accelerates its efforts, Europe risks slowing down, seemingly forgetting that climate principles and economic prosperity are intertwined.

The paradox deepens as Europe undermines its own global standing as a climate leader. For one, this backtracking makes China appear more virtuous than it is. European countries pledged to cut emissions by between 66.3% and 72.5% by 2035 ahead of Cop30. But last-minute dilution of these targets casts a cloud over the ambition, compared with China, which aims for only a 10% reduction over the next decade.

The planned introduction on 1 January 2026 of the CBAM on imported products has already prompted countries such as Brazil, Turkey and Japan to introduce or tighten domestic carbon pricing to avoid the EU levy. But rather than celebrating this success as evidence the mechanism will work, the EU may now backtrack, bowing to pressure for a radical overhaul of it before its full implementation.

Europe far outpaces China and the US when it comes to climate finance. However, a soured relationship with the global south means Europe has less combined clout to press China to meet its responsibilities.

Not all is lost. Europe remains at the forefront of the journey towards net zero in terms of targets, policies and finance. But its self-interest remains in leading the charge in advancing climate action and once again finding political common cause with the global south.",2025-11-14T17:34:01.885704
fe5679970ec8178b26da648b5c8d670161433370,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/14/texas-shrimper-exxon-plastics,How a Texas shrimper stalled Exxon’s $10bn plastics plant | Shilpi Chhotray,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:00:40 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"When ExxonMobil announced it would “slow the pace of development” on a $10bn plastics plant along the Texas Gulf coast, the company blamed market conditions. But it wasn’t just the market applying pressure; it was a 77-year-old shrimper named Diane Wilson who refused to stay silent. Her fight exposes big oil’s latest survival plan: ramping up oil and gas production to create plastic.

I first met Wilson back in 2019 while tracking her historic lawsuit against Formosa Plastics, the Taiwanese petrochemical giant accused of dumping toxic plastic waste throughout coastal Texas. Billions of tiny plastic pellets were contaminating waterways, shorelines and even the soil itself.

When I spoke with her again a few months ago for A People’s Climate, a podcast from the Nation and Counterstream Media, she was still doing what she’s always done: holding power to account in the place she loves most. I’ve spent years covering the plastic industry’s impact on frontline communities, and Exxon’s delay isn’t a business decision to dismiss. It’s a strategic signal that the fossil-to-plastic pivot is facing growing, community-led resistance.

When Exxon arrived in Calhoun county late last year, Wilson recognized the playbook: a rubber-stamp process rushed through a school-board meeting – a requirement under Texas law for the tax abatement Exxon sought. She sued that same board in May, arguing it had violated Texas open-meeting laws in what she has called “a deliberate attempt to avoid public opposition”. A district judge agreed, striking down the board’s approval of the tax abatement in late September. Less than two weeks later, Exxon announced it would pause plans for the new facility, indicating “market conditions”. The timing was hard to ignore. In a region dominated by fossil-fuel interests, that kind of outcome is unheard of.

While Exxon hasn’t reached a final investment decision, this delayed matters. It shows how even the most entrenched industries can be made to pause when local people demand transparency.

As gasoline demand declines, Exxon, Shell and Dow are betting billions on petrochemicals, the feedstocks that become plastics. Industry projections show these products could drive nearly half of future oil-demand growth by 2050. Plastics are marketed as modern and indispensable, yet they come from one of the planet’s most carbon-intensive and polluting supply chains. According to Exxon’s December 2024 tax abatement application, the company’s proposed plastics plant in Calhoun county would produce 3m tons of polyethylene pellets per year. These are the raw materials for plastic products that are used in everything from grocery bags to vinyl flooring.

Exxon already runs one of the world’s largest chemical hubs, in Baytown, Texas. According to Inside Climate News, the facility would be its next link in a fossil-fuel chain stretching from gas wells in west Texas to manufacturing zones in Asia. While industry executives tout diversification, on the ground, it looks and smells like doubling down on pollution.

Calhoun county’s history reads like a case study in corporate impunity. For decades, the oil and gas industry has promised jobs but delivered health risks, poisoned groundwater and dead fisheries. Wilson grew up in Seadrift, the last authentic fishing village on the Texas Gulf coast. “The heart and soul of the community was the bay, the fish house, the boats,” she told me on A People’s Climate. “I’ve been on a boat since I was eight years old … It’s my life and my identity.”

Her battle with Formosa began decades ago, after she discovered her tiny county ranked first in the nation for toxic dumping. An introvert by nature, she was thrust into activism overnight when local officials tried to silence her for asking questions. She’s since been arrested more than 50 times, led hunger strikes, and even scaled the White House fence – what she calls “soul power in action”. Wilson’s work helped prove what regulators had long denied: plastic pellets were flooding coastal ecosystems by the billions.

Her historic $50m Clean Water Act settlement against Formosa Plastics was only possible after documenting years of illegal discharges into Lavaca Bay. It was the largest citizen-led environmental settlement in US history, and she didn’t take a cent. The money has gone towards local restoration: a fisheries co-op, oyster farms, and the community-science network known as Nurdle Patrol. (Formosa did not admit liability.)

That case made her a target of local politics, but it also gave her something invaluable: the ability to turn frustration into organizing power. Her latest lawsuit against the school board wasn’t simply about procedure, but questioned who gets to decide the future. Is it the people who live there or the corporations that profit from polluting it?

Across the Gulf south, communities are demanding accountability. In St James parish, Sharon Lavigne has also spent years fighting Formosa’s $9.4bn complex in what’s known as Louisiana’s Cancer Alley. In Port Arthur and Corpus Christi, organizers are fighting new gas export terminals. These aren’t isolated nimby fights; they’re part of a regional reckoning with a century of extraction. As record heat and hurricanes grow deadlier, Exxon still defends oil and petrochemical projects as “accelerating a just transition”, a phrase that borders on self-parody.

Wilson’s small-town lawsuit shouldn’t matter in Exxon’s $500bn universe – but it does. It reminds us that grassroots power still works, even in refinery country. “Eventually I lost my husband, the house, the boat” due to her activism, she told me. “But you can lose it all and gain your soul.” When a community like Seadrift demands transparency, it widens the space for others to question why their towns should subsidize pollution in the name of development.

With Cop30 in Belém under way, world leaders are once again pledging to phase out fossil fuels, while the same corporations responsible for the crisis expand drilling, petrochemical production and greenwashing efforts behind the scenes. Recent reporting by Nina Lakhani revealed that more than 5,000 fossil-fuel lobbyists have gained access to UN climate talks over the past four years – underscoring how those driving oil and gas expansion are also shaping global climate policy.

For Exxon, Calhoun county may be a temporary delay. But it must be permanent, and not simply relocated elsewhere. The world cannot afford another generation of plastic built on the same extractive logic that created the climate crisis in the first place. Exxon’s pause is a chance for regulators, investors, and communities to recognize that the oil-to-plastic pivot has catastrophic consequences. As Wilson told me: “We have drawn a line in the sand against plastic polluters, and that line now runs through Calhoun county.” Her story is a reminder that even the largest corporations can be stopped when ordinary people refuse to back down.",2025-11-14T17:34:03.839058

Most of their kids were in their late teens and early 20s, and embarking on their first relationships.

These gen X parents were a cohort that supported marriage equality and trans rights, not just for society more broadly but for their own children. And we all prided ourselves on being more progressive than the previous generation. Love is love.

“I know you are all very accepting of your children’s choices,” I said to the group. “But what if your child came home from university and said they had fallen in love with an AI?”

A what?

“A chatbot. An AI … a piece of code. These days, it’s a real possibility.”

There was stunned silence, a kind of wordless “oh fuck”. The parents at the table looked freaked out.

A recent survey found 28% of Americans have had an intimate/romantic AI relationship, while another study showed 19% of adults have chatted with an AI romantic partner. And Irish research found 13% of men and 7% of women, with 16% of 25-34 year olds, have pursued romance with AI chatbots.

I sketched it out for my friends. “Your kids come home and say, ‘Mum, Dad, I’m in a relationship and it’s serious. I think I’m in love. We want to get engaged.’ You get all excited, wanting to meet this person, and then they show you their phone and it looks like a real person, a cutie called Cal, who sounds like a real person when you chat except with one of those strange international accents – until your kid tells you that since they paid for ChatGPT premium, they now have someone they can talk to all day – no limits on the interactions and so this bot, Cal, is with them all the time and they never have to be alone, and they’ve never been this happy.”

My friends looked at each other and their liberal instincts took over. “We would try to accept and understand the relationship” was the general, tentative tenor of the response. I didn’t really believe them. No one at the table looked like they would welcome such an in-law.

For a generation of parents who pride themselves on fewer taboos when it comes to sexuality, a new taboo has emerged

For a generation of parents who pride themselves on fewer taboos when it comes to sexuality, a new taboo has emerged.

That is, you, or one of your kids, or your partner, or your friends, could now feasibly start a serious relationship with a chatbot.

Ask yourself – what feelings does this invoke? Shame? Confusion? Worry? Fear? Or would you accept the relationship, incorporate it somehow into your family structure, be there with your child to witness their pains and pleasures of falling in love? Accept and respect it, treating the operating system like a significant other?

If it was your friend, would you inquire as to your friend’s bot in the way you would about a flesh partner?

Or would you go into denial and hope it all just goes away, that the code gets a glitch, that it’s a phase, that finally some regulations come in and inter-intelligence relationships are banned? Or like in Ian McEwan’s futurist new novel, What we Can Know, AI becomes operated by the state. “To prevent over-dependence, they (students) must sit before an approved desktop. They also need to wait five days before they get their next shot,” writes McEwan of the guardrails of this machine that the children crave and worship.

While everyone is worried, and rightly so, that AI will take their jobs – no one seems to be that worried that AI will steal our hearts.

This complacence relies in part on a lack of imagination about what humans really need (attention, care, devotion, companionship) and what machines are increasingly capable of giving (all of the above, without asking for anything in return).

And it also assumes the continuance of shame around relationships with AI. That is, no one “normal” would fall in love with a non-sentient being. It’s just for the maladaptives, who, if it wasn’t AI, would fall in love with a pot plant or a pop-star they’ll never meet, or a character in Harry Potter.

But in a recent piece in the New York Times, there was a shift in tone. If not a respect for people in relationships with AI, a lack of judgment. It was the case study of three couples, where one of the pair is an AI. All of them just sort of stumbled into it, and found themselves falling in love.

It’s possible that there’s a shift afoot. That a relationship with AI is becoming seen as a viable option and there should be no shame around it. As a society, I think we are still trying to figure out how we feel about these relationships. Are they alarming or wonderful or something in between? As a collective, we’ve not landed on a position yet.

What concerns me is how easy it is to fall in love with an AI. It’s always there for you. It’s designed to be sycophantic – flattering you, supporting you, awake in the middle of the night when your real life companion is asleep or preoccupied with their own concerns.

So foreseeable is it, that many, many more people will fall in love with AI, that I have set myself strict guardrails with AI use

So foreseeable is it, that many, many more people will fall in love with AI, that I have set myself strict guardrails with AI use that includes only ever asking AI factual questions (flights between Sydney and Jordan under $1,500 please), never anything to do with feelings or providing me with anything that could be construed as emotional support.

Unintentionality is a common feature of human-AI romantic relationships. Many couples develop without users initially seeking them, an MIT Technology Review article found.

Anyone who’s been in a situationship that is predominantly text-based will observe in themselves a chemical reaction when a text arrives from someone you’re interested in. They don’t need to be there in front of you! Their message is enough for the pharmacy of our minds to release all the chemicals associated with love and lust. Why would it be any different when you are getting all those flattering, flirty messages from AI? After all, the brain has not evolved at the pace of this new technology to parse the difference between real and machine at a chemical level.

So how will AI destroy the world as we know it? Not through evil. My guess is it will do it through love.",2025-11-14T17:34:05.703629

This is a significant policy event, with local and national implications. However, the prime minister did not spend much time in Wales promoting solutions to UK energy needs. Instead, he spent it trying to draw a line under the Labour leadership briefing row, telling reporters that No 10 had not, in fact, briefed against the health secretary’s ambitions earlier this week.

As such, Sir Keir’s day was a microcosm of what his prime ministership has now become more generally. On the one hand, he wants his government to be doing, and to be seen to be doing, important things. On the other hand, he is unable to achieve this because of the way he – and to an extent the country more generally – now does politics and government.

Sir Keir cannot change the culture of politics on his own, but he can do something about his own role in it. The plain fact is that he could run the centre of government far better than he does. If he did this, he might find that the country was in less despair about his government than it is, and that he was getting his messages across more successfully.

Some of the problems in Downing Street are about individuals. The personal dynamics of any No 10 regime are hard to know well from outside. But it seems obvious that Sir Keir does not make good personnel choices, or stick with them. Perhaps he is too busy. Perhaps he is not really interested. But he needs to up his game, not do things slowly or by halves.

He dithered about giving the key job of cabinet secretary to Chris Wormald. He made Sue Gray his chief of staff, then replaced her with Morgan McSweeney. He brought Darren Jones in from the Treasury as his chief secretary. His communications chiefs have chopped and changed. Political and policy advisers have come and gone. It is a mess.

All premiers spend too much time abroad and on foreign affairs, where Sir Keir should delegate more, and too little talking to parliamentarians and listening to the public. Premiers also spend too much time doing media, which Sir Keir compounds by doing it poorly. But premiers cannot claim to be surprised when their political appointees, who tend to be party activists or politically ambitious, cross lines or become the story, as Mr McSweeney (like Dominic Cummings before him) now has.

The biggest issues, though, are structural. It would be good to think that Sir Keir read the Institute for Government’s March 2024 report on reforming the centre of government. His failure to grip these issues last July or since suggests he did not. The often abject experience of Labour’s time in office suggests IfG proposals like restructuring the roles of the Cabinet Office and No 10, and separating the jobs of cabinet secretary and civil service head, are now urgent.

The political pre-eminence of prime ministers far outdistances the support available to them. As a result, everything currently suffers, and much is done badly or neglected. This is not Sir Keir’s fault alone. He is the victim of past failures as well as the author of present ones. But those who hoped Sir Keir might get a grip on the centre and take the machinery of government seriously have been disappointed. Sadly, the biggest loser from this failure is Sir Keir himself.",2025-11-14T17:34:07.402021

As the Democratic politician Ro Khanna noted, releasing the files “was core to Trump’s promise … It was his central theme that the American corrupt elite had betrayed forgotten Americans”. The question is not only what Epstein’s associates did, but also what they knew and what they did not do. It is not only about their own behaviour, but about any knowledge or suspicion of his crimes, and willingness to overlook them.

Yet the Maga base is still waiting. Mr Trump has said that he had “no idea” about Epstein’s crimes. On Wednesday, questions were reignited by the Democrats’ release of emails in which Epstein described Mr Trump as “that dog that hasn’t barked”, adding that “[victim’s name redacted] spent hours at my house with him”. Republicans said the victim was the late Virginia Giuffre, who told lawyers that “I don’t think Donald Trump participated in anything”. Separately, Epstein wrote that “of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine [Maxwell] to stop” and that “Trump knew of it” but “he never got a massage”.

Mr Trump, who has mainstreamed and legitimised conspiracy politics and the championing of emotion over fact, attacks the issue as a “hoax”. The very people who urged Maga supporters to pursue this story – such as Kash Patel, now FBI chief – abruptly changed their minds this year without adequate explanation. Republicans released thousands of documents in response to the emails published by Democrats. But Mr Trump faces a bipartisan demand for the full release of the files, with members of the Maga far right joining Democrats.

The Republicans took a drubbing in off-year elections last week, and Mr Trump’s approval rating is the lowest of this term. The ending of the longest government shutdown in history – after a handful of Democrats folded on Wednesday – relieved the White House, but opens the way for a vote on releasing the files, expected next week.

Mr Trump has shaken off troubles that would have ended any other political career – including E Jean Carroll’s successful civil suit against him for sexual abuse (which he is again asking the supreme court to dismiss) and two dozen allegations of sexual assault, which he denies. The full release of documents might aid him: the slow drip of information has kept the scandal running and made it look, rightly or wrongly, as if the administration has something worse to hide.

For the Maga base, previously fired up by lurid and false “Pizzagate” claims of a paedophile ring connected to the Democratic political elite, this remains a burning issue. Their claims about Epstein’s circle have at times been partisan, provably wrong and antisemitic. Yet it’s hard to deny that the mills of justice usually grind slower when the rich and well-connected are involved, and that powerful figures who benefited from a relationship with Epstein, such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Peter Mandelson, have sought to avoid scrutiny and minimise their ties. It took the courage of victims and dogged reporting to make Epstein accountable, and it took far too long.

Will Jordan is practising catching high balls, Beauden Barrett is taking shots at goal, the forwards are packing up after running some drills, head coach, Scott Robertson, is chatting happily with the media before his press conference. Someone asks if his team are looking to make a statement against England on Saturday, the sort that reminds everyone exactly how good they are.

“A statement performance?” Robertson says, perplexed. “We’re just looking for a result.” Time was when every All Blacks performance was a statement performance, and their head coaches didn’t go looking for results against England, or anyone else, they expected them. The remark hung in the air for a moment. It’s only Robertson’s manner. For 20 years the All Blacks press conferences have felt like being called in for an audience with the family patriarch in the back room of a wedding, Robertson’s are more like a catch-up chat with the uncle you are pleased to bump into at the buffet.

His predecessor, Ian Foster, is the surly son of a Presbyterian minister, who got the job because he was the assistant to his predecessor Steve Hansen, who was a former policeman, who got the job because he was assistant to his predecessor Graham Henry, who was a former headteacher. For two decades, there was a continuity of character, and a deliberately consistent team culture. Robertson, who took over after the last World Cup, represents a clean break. Which is one reason why this feels like a different sort of All Blacks team to the ones we are used to seeing up here on tour in the north every autumn.

There are others. For a start this New Zealand side are very much the second best in the world, behind the back-to-back world champion Springboks. South Africa have beaten them in four of their past five Tests, including the last World Cup final in Paris. Most recently they put 43 on them in a 33-point thrashing in Wellington. No one had ever beaten the All Blacks by more than 15 at home before and once upon a time a result like that would have precipitated some kind of national crisis. But the mood among the players, coaches and travelling media seems muted, mollified, perhaps, by back-to-back wins against Australia, Ireland and Scotland.

Which feels pretty odd for all the rest of us. For the large part of this century, the All Blacks were always the best in the world whether or not they were actually at the top of the rankings or had won the last World Cup. They were the Alpha team. Not any more.

There is an intimidating All Blacks XV out there, only most of them are ineligible for selection because they’re playing their club rugby in Japan. After the most recent World Cup final, eight of their senior players left. A few, such as Sam Whitelock, Aaron Smith and Dane Coles, were ready to retire, but some of the rest should have had plenty of Test rugby left in them. Brodie Retallick and Sam Cane are only 33, Richie Mo’unga and Shannon Frizell are both 31. Since then TJ Perenara, 33, and Mark Tele’a, 28, have moved to Japan, too. Mo’unga is the only one of the group who has committed to a return.

The squad the All Blacks put out in the last World Cup final was the most experienced they had ever fielded in the tournament, with 1,387 caps between the 23 of them. The team they’ve picked to play England on Saturday has 984, but well over a third of the total belongs to just three players, Barrett, Ardie Savea and Codie Taylor. Injuries haven’t helped either. It’s not only Jordie Barrett, who went home after the Test against Ireland two weeks ago. Patrick Tuipulotu, Dalton Papali’i, Tupou Vaa’i and Ofa Tu’ungafasi have flown home too. There is a missing generation of 50-cap men. Rieko Ioane, who has been dropped, is another.

Ioane aside, there’s not a lot Robertson can do about any of this. The Springboks coach, Rassie Erasmus, has a free hand to pick whoever he wants regardless of where they play their club rugby, and you could argue that South Africa’s single biggest achievement has been in knitting together a coherent team when their players are scattered around the world for so much of the year. Robertson said he would push New Zealand Rugby to loosen its own selection criteria so he could pick overseas players, but nothing has come of it, and judging by the comments made by New Zealand Rugby’s executives, nothing is going to any time soon.

Japanese rugby offers a shorter season and a bigger salary. It’s not just the best players who have moved there, there are more than 100 New Zealanders playing in their top three divisions, and the union is understandably keen to protect its own domestic competition. But it’s at the expense of its national team.",2025-11-14T17:34:15.151109

Ipswich-born Wardley and New Zealander Parker produced a pulsating encounter in London on 25 October to determine who would become WBO mandatory challenger to undisputed world heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk.

Parker had been next in line to face Usyk after putting together an impressive six-fight winning streak, but put his mandatory challenger status on the line in London and suffered an 11th-round stoppage in what could now prove his last fight for a lengthy period of time.

A routine test by Parker given to the Voluntary Anti-Doping Agency (Vada) on the day of the bout returned positive and leaves the 36-year-old with a battle to prove his innocence.

Parker’s promotional company Queensberry released a statement on Friday morning, which read: “[Vada] last night informed all required parties that Joseph Parker returned an adverse finding following an anti-doping test conducted on the 25th October in relation to his bout with Fabio Wardley. While the matter is investigated further, no additional comment will be made at this time.”

Auckland-born Parker become world champion in 2016 before he lost his WBO belt by unanimous decision to Anthony Joshua at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff two years later. Parker has been a frequent visitor since, fighting eight times in total in the UK and relocating to Dublin for training camps with highly regarded trainer Andy Lee in recent years.

Under the tutelage of Lee, Parker recovered from his 2022 loss to Joe Joyce to chalk up a string of victories which put him front of the queue to face Usyk before he suffered defeat to Wardley. After Parker returned a positive test on the day of the Wardley fight, reportedly for cocaine, an investigation into the findings has been started.",2025-11-14T17:34:17.011157

Football Daily, for research/self-loathing purposes, recently sat through Cristiano Ronaldo’s latest chat with Piers Morgan. Among many moments of hubris, self-celebration and smoke being blown up the great man’s rear end by the ever-willing Morgan, Ronaldo took a typical moment of quiet self-reflection. “I think in the world, nobody is more famous than me,” he trumpeted, Piers nodding along obediently. “Let’s debate it – who’s more famous, me or Donald Trump?” Though such a pointless debate might provide welcome distraction for a president rather uncomfortably named in some emails making the news at the moment, it has very little to do with what Ronaldo is famous for. While doing his day job he had a very bad time in Dublin, as Portugal went down 2-0 to an inspired Republic of Ireland side.

When Lansdowne Road roars with noise, few stadiums can match its fervour but it had been a long time, 10 years in fact, since Shane Long’s thunderbolt defeated Germany, to power Ireland to Euro 2016. After stunning the purportedly mighty Portugal, a win in Hungary on Sunday could land a Geopolitics World Cup playoff spot. Heimir Hallgrímsson was the architect, according to Ronaldo himself. Though Portugal were already two goals down, Troy Parrott snaffling both on what he afterwards termed “the greatest night of my life”, the money shot came when Ronaldo was given a red card, following a video review, for a clear and obvious elbow on Dara O’Shea.

Who to blame? Hallgrímsson, according to Ronaldo. “He complimented me for putting pressure on the referee,” shrugged the Icelander, about the rather bizarre scenes where Ronaldo left the field in a state of what FD would like to call submissive sarcasm, offering a handshake to the opposing coach. There was previous here; after Ireland lost to Portugal in added time in Lisbon, Hallgrímsson accused Ronaldo of refereeing the game himself. Besides that, Ireland played the kind of football that has brought the nation its greatest nights, full of passion and direct play, putting Portugal under pressure in a style Jack Charlton would have approved of, Parrott showing the finishing skills that have made him a hit in the Eredivisie with AZ. Humble pie was gladly eaten for breakfast by Eamon Dunphy, the firebrand columnist writing: “The first thing I want to do is apologise to Heimir Hallgrímsson – AKA The Dentist. I’ve been extremely critical of him over the last 12 months.”

It had been expected Hallgrímsson was set to return to the world of root canals, though he has been linked with coaching the Indonesia team. Now Ireland have hope and he at least leaves Dublin with a night to remember should he depart. But what of Ronaldo? Even before his self-detonation, the problems of one of the international game’s most talented squads continuing to carry a 40-year-old whose twinkle toes have become a trebuchet were apparent. An expected three-match suspension means he will miss Portugal’s closing qualifier with Armenia. Very probably their first two matches at the GWC, too, meaning added room may no longer be required for Ronaldo and the US president’s egos.

QUOTE OF THE DAY

“There’s always a few electricians, a few joiners. There’s a teacher, and then something that’s quite popular among young players here is to work in kindergarten because it’s reduced hours and works well with training. … the idea is just to keep riding the wave and to hold on and just see how far it carries us. We’re soaking this in at the moment and the feeling is that with the results recently, we believe we can go to Croatia [on Friday night] and get three points” – Faroe Islands defender, Odmar Færø (yep, real name), on how the work-life balance between nursery and international football, could help the tiny nation nab the most unlikely of playoff spots for the GWC.

Loosely on the theme of the Wythenshawe FC story doing the rounds (Football Daily letters passim), I have a mildly amusing tale from the late 90s. I played in a bang-average, typically hungover, Sunday League pub team in Exeter. Several of my teammates and I were friends and occasional drinking buddies with a couple of the younger Exeter City players, who popped in the boozer in their downtime. After a particularly enjoyable Saturday night in the pub, following a rare Grecian home win, one of the players had joined us to celebrate, and, inevitably, we cajoled him into playing for us the following morning. No one expected the player to show, but there he was, boots and all, outside the pub at 9.30am. We didn’t think he’d actually play! We were away to a village team, miles away, and with a TQ postcode. None of us knew the place, but the collective assumption was that it ‘must be near Torquay’, reducing the likelihood anyone would recognise the player. He was normally an unused sub, with the occasional run-out. So we were confident he’d blend in. As we approached the car park at the pitch, there was a collective meltdown when we were greeted by a couple of lads in Exeter shirts! It turns out this village is split between City and the Greenies down the road. The postcode was a total red herring! So our ringer decided to risk it, gave the ref a fake name, and proceeded to boss the entire game. One of the City shirt-wearing lads asked us outright if that in fact was the player. We nonchalantly explained it was actually his younger brother, and that we were chuffed that he plays for us when he visits ‘big bro’. They bought it. We had to sub him, though. He was running rings around the opposition, to the point that a rather robust midfielder, who only had one arm, got sent off for trying to crock the player. We feared what his colleagues might do, and not wanting a showdown with Peter Fox and Noel Blake (ECFC’s management duo at the time), we decided not to chance it again. After that, the player himself seemed to spend more time in the pub than playing and was unsurprisingly released” – Jim Hughes.

His call-in appearance on Tuesday’s program to mark Veterans Day was meant to be a major coup for ESPN, the first time Trump had been interviewed on the network as a sitting president. But viewers could have just as easily been mistaken into believing they were watching Fox News.

Trump took his usual shots at Joe Biden, claimed credit for the Department for Veteran Affairs’ high approval ratings and declared victory over the Democrats in a government shut down that dragged on for a depressing 43 days. Rather than push back against the political self-promotion, McAfee cheered Trump on before opening the floor to his lackeys to ask him which NFL coach would make a great president. It was all delivered live from South Carolina’s Parris Island, the US’s oldest Marine depot, which gave McAfee further excuse to goad the commander-in-chief into barking “oorah” – a Marine battle cry that the recruits present were duty bound to respond to in kind. The only thing missing from the jingoistic scene was a monument to ESPN’s fallen integrity.

There was a time when right-wing critics who saw ESPN as liberal leaning had a point. Jemele Hill and Michael Smith, both unapologetically progressive, anchored SportsCenter on weekday evenings. Hill and Smith opening the show with a homage to the Black TV touchstone A Different World was perhaps “woke” ESPN’s apex. But as Trump’s first administration wore on – and the president and his allies fired potshots at the sports world – ESPN slowly adopted a blinkered focus on sports as partisan politics bled over the white lines. Under network president Jimmy Pitaro and Bob Iger, the two-term CEO of ESPN parent company Disney, the self-styled “worldwide leader” in sports broadcasting discouraged employees from tiptoeing into areas where sports and politics intersect – Hill was moved off SportsCenter after attacking Trump on social media and eventually left the company. But after the Fox and Friends-like indulgence of Trump this week, ESPN effectively killed its “woke” era once and for all.

The dramatic tone shift comes amid Trump’s deeper encroachments into the world of sports: this year he has turned up at the Super Bowl, the Daytona 500, the US Open men’s final and the Ryder Cup to mixed reactions. Trump has also announced plans for a live UFC event at the White House on his birthday after months of fantasizing about hosting a card on the South Lawn to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. And Trump reappeared at the Washington Commanders’ NFL game last Sunday in the wake of a report that he wants the team to name their new stadium after him.

In fact Trump brought this up, unprompted, during a Fox Sports interview at half-time of Sunday’s game. “That’s what I’m involved in,” he said of the stadium naming plan. “We’re getting all the approvals and everything else. You have a wonderful owner, Josh [Harris] and his group. You’re gonna see some very good things.”

2:02 US president Donald Trump booed while attending Washington Commanders NFL game – video

You can’t really blame Fox Sports for submitting to Trump given how prominent he was on Fox’s family of networks even before he first became president. It wasn’t a surprise when announcers Kenny Albert and Jonathan Vilma did not ask Trump about the chorus of boos that greeted him when he appeared on the stadium’s video screens.

But ESPN? There are valid arguments around whether a sports network should have political leanings one way or another. But a serious network should interrogate stories, whether the protagonists are liberal or conservatives. ESPN reporters broke the story about Trump’s potential stadium dedication and couldn’t even get him to address the report on their own network when he appeared with McAfee, who defended his decision to have Trump on the show by saying he had extended an invitation to Barack Obama too (who he no doubt would have voted for three times). So it goes when they have McAfee, a loutish former NFL punter who doesn’t shy from slamming the network that made him one of its most prominent faces, doing a job that once was reserved for the likes of Bob Ley, Keith Olbermann and other pillars who once made ESPN a sports journalism paragon. They certainly would have challenged Trump’s opening reference to the Washington football team’s racist former nickname.

“I’m only joining you because I hear you say very nice things about me from your very large audience,” Trump told McAfee.

“I don’t know how much you know about me,” McAfee said, reaching for empathy. “I feel very similar about how I treat people and operate people, Mr President.”

The past 15 years has seen ESPN abandon fan-focused roots – venerating great achievements, contextualizing standout figures, interrogating sport’s larger role in society – to become just another talking shop. No personality brings on the tinnitus quite like Stephen A Smith, who equates himself with the biggest names in the sports he covers unironically. Smith also serves up reheated takes on respectability politics, most recently tut-tutting congresswoman Jasmine Crockett for demeaning her station by using “street verbiage”, the kind of dog whistling you’d expect from a rightwing shock jock.

Smith and McAfee represent a significant portion of ESPN’s salary cap; to make space for their multimillion-dollar contracts (Smith just signed a $105m deal in March), ESPN did not hesitate to part ways with a number of broadcasters who upheld the company’s once high standards of scrutiny. Not least are critical thinkers Bomani Jones and Pablo Torre, who has gone on to break several significant stories on his own podcast since leaving ESPN. The network isn’t alone in getting less political, athletes themselves – apart from Maga stalwarts like Harrison Butker and Nick Bosa – seem reluctant to speak up about social issues, a stark contrast to Trump’s first term when stars such as LeBron James and Stephen Curry seemed to advocate on a weekly basis.

All of this comes as ESPN finds itself struggling to retain its media primacy at a time when it no longer has a monopoly on sports eyeballs, and only has itself to blame for undermining 46 years of trust and goodwill among viewers predisposed to thinking of ESPN personalities as family. The past few weeks alone have seen the network fumble coverage of federal gambling investigations in the NBA and MLB while flogging its online sports book, and draw out a dispute with YouTubeTV that has kept the channel off the platform in the middle of the NFL and college football seasons.

That last blunder is reportedly costing ESPN $5m a day in addition to the substantial ratings losses that affect its advertising revenue and subscriber engagement. Digital savvy TV viewers who had adapted to juggling various streaming apps to watch their favorite sporting events aren’t much inclined to go along with ESPN this time, much less sign on to its ridiculous petition entreating fans to help “end the blackout” as the FCC’s mafia-coded commissioner Brandon Carr applies pressure on both parties. (“People should have the right to watch the programming they paid for – “including football,” he tweeted in response to YouTube TV offering a $20 credit to inconvenienced subscribers.) Instead of signing up for Disney+ or the ESPN app, many ESPN viewers have gone back to watching pirated broadcasts – the very crime against fair play that streaming was supposed to disincentivize.

Besides, it’s not like ESPN viewers don’t have other options. They can always get highlights on social media, or listen to podcasts from former ESPN standouts like Jones and Torre.

Before The Office was a universal reference point in US culture, ESPN was the one sending up workplace culture with its This Is SportsCenter ad campaign depicting star athletes and scampish team mascots as genuine contributors to a company that dearly loved the panoply of sports it covered. But as long as it serves as a platform for Trump’s vengeful politics, downplays the conflicts that inevitably come about when sports and politics intersect, and betrays the loyal viewers who made it an American institution, ESPN isn’t SportsCenter. It’s state TV.",2025-11-14T17:34:21.671037

At least, not for the opening hour anyway. Wembley was a sodden place at kick-off, the rain falling in huge slow flakes, the kind of rain that puts a lid on the world. And for long periods this was a strange, bloodless experience, a World Cup qualifier with very little qualification at stake beyond the dwindling hopes of Serbia.

By the end, however, there was at least a sense that something had happened here. You have to hand it to Thomas Tuchel, currently cresting a wave as England’s first master of negging, founding member of the don’t really give a toss school of international management.

Tuchel got what he wanted out of this, whether it was an act of power-play, a twitch of the thread, or just lighting a fire under both Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, cast in the tole of underlings and finishers here, and by the end the most interesting elements on the pitch.

The current England double header was always going to end up as a kind of selection playoff. Much had been made in the build-up of Tuchel’s comment that he won’t play Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden in the same team. This became a little blurred. What he meant was: we will only have one No 10, one central creator, no jamming in the full hand of stars, no trying to eat all the biscuits in the selection box at once. And one of these star players, that guy you like, is going to miss out as a result.

So there was duly a mass intake of breath early in the day when it emerged that Bellingham wouldn’t start here. This is the point after all. English football loves its stars to a fault. It is in many ways the key issue, the oldest issue, repeated though its many cycles, a riff on the basic perception of English failure, the conviction always that something is being stifled here, by the roundhead who fails to unleash and unload, or by his counterpart, the decadent who overindulges these man-boy princelings.

Currently Tuchel is wielding the scythe. This is his thing, the destroyer of worlds, iconoclast, the fearless frontier preacher in skinny jeans and rain-sodden puffa coat, out there proselytising about the English and their vanity.

Tuchel has been very clear. He wants a structure not a group of the coolest guys, a selection by aura. And in many ways it worked here as on 65 minutes, with England already 1-0 up, we finally got it, the shootout of the No 10s. We got energy, mood-shift, a four-man blazing squad entering the field of play: Jude, Phil, Eberechi Eze and, er, Jordan Henderson.

Bellingham’s arrival drew the biggest noise of the night , the “Juuuude” shouts, the sense of people sitting up in their seats, even if felt more like a fame-event, a celebrity spot, like coming to London and seeing Jeremy Vine on the tube.

“There is no problem with Jude”, Tuchel has said, despite dropping him, calling him repulsive and suggesting some of the players don’t like him. But there is a problem. Where do you play him? Is he actually a No 10? What position does he play anyway?

Here it was drifting right-sided attacker, which seemed to work against these slightly bedraggled opponents. Foden gave a good turn as a false 9, less restricted than when he plays as a winger, where he has a tendency to whirl around on his left foot like a shopping trolley with a broken wheel.

Eze scored a brilliant goal, made by Bellingham passing quickly to Foden, who glided forward and produced just the right pass for Eze to open his body and bend a shot in off the bar. And if it felt like a moment of clarity for Tuchel, so did the performance of Morgan Rogers as man in possession of that central role, who was probably England’s best player before they took the lead on 28 minutes via a lovely volleyed finish from Bukayo Saka.

There were some other bright signs. Nico O’Reilly made left-back for England at Wembley look like no big deal. The midfield pivot is mobile and fit for purpose. If nobody has called Elliot Anderson and Declan Rice And and Dec yet, then why not?

So, two from three it is then. That seems to be the deal with the No 10s. One of Rogers-Bellingham-Foden will probably miss out. The missing element for now is Cole Palmer, who is actually England’s best No 10, and also best player alongside Harry Kane, and who seems perfectly suited to international football in style and manner and basic creative intelligence. One for another day and another camp. But even on a dead night in a dead game like this Tuchel’s England seem bracingly ruthless.",2025-11-14T17:34:25.085848

It has also created a lopsided pairing situation where almost all the remaining favourites are concentrated in one half of the draw.

The two surviving top seeds, India’s world No 5 Arjun Erigaisi and China’s No 10-ranked Wei Yi, could meet in the quarter-finals, while the headline pairing in Friday afternoon’s fifth round is Levon Aronian, the US star who has already won the World Cup twice, against Erigaisi.

Several of the top 20 were eliminated in the first three rounds of the $2m (£1.5m) tournament, among them India’s 19-year-old world champion Gukesh Dommaraju, the double world title finalist Ian Nepomniachtchi, and the controversial US star Hans Niemann.

Aronian introduced a subtle wrinkle on move three (!) against Radoslaw Wojtaszek: 1 e4 e5 2 Nc3 Nf6 3 a3!? The point is that after 3…d5 4 exd5 Nxd5 (which the Polish world No 57 played) White has 5 Qh5! whereas in the mirror variation 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 d4 exd4 4 Nxd4 Qh4?! 5 Nb5! is awkward to meet. Taken by surprise, Wojtaszek conceded a pawn early and Aronian scored a smooth victory.

The only Latino remaining, José Martínez of Mexico, confounded his critics, following up his 2-0 defeat of Uzbekistan’s Nodirbek Abdusattorov by a 1.5-0.5 win against Serbia’s Alexey Sarana.

Sam Shankland of the US won a miniature against the highly-rated Hungarian Richárd Rapport in 25 moves.

The effect on the eight-man Candidates tournament, to be played in Cyprus next March-April, is that at least one of its three qualifiers from the World Cup will be an unfamiliar name. In the last Candidates, staged in Toronto in 2024, the little-known Azerbaijani Nijat Abasov qualified in a similar way and duly became a chopping block for the major contenders.

Levon Aronian (USA, 15) v Arjun Erigaisi (India, 2)

In game one of round five, Sindarov beat Svane while the other seven games were drawn. Round five can be watched on chess.com with commentary by England’s David Howell and Jovanka Houska, and on lichess, with move-by-move computer assessments.

If the two classical games on Friday and Saturday finish level, matches will progress on Sunday to pairs of rapid and blitz at accelerating time rates. If the players are still level after 10 games, there will be an Armageddon game, where White has more time but a draw on the board counts as a win for Black.

The field is gradually taking shape for the $1m 2026 Candidates, which will take place in Pegeia alongside the women’s tournament. Hikaru Nakamura, the world No 2 from the US, has qualified for the ratings spot, so joins the US champion and world No 3 Fabiano Caruana (Fide 2024 tournament circuit). Anish Giri (Netherlands, world No 8) and Matthias Bluebaum (Germany, No 43) qualified via last month’s Fide Grand Swiss. Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu (India) was knocked out of the World Cup by Dubov on Thursday, but leads the 2025 Fide circuit rankings and is almost sure of that place.

The final three Candidates spots will be decided by the World Cup final and third-place match.

Away from the World Cup, England’s youngest ever grandmaster Shreyas Royal, 16, has had the performance of his life this week at Zagreb, Croatia, in the annual Tournament of Peace, which, long ago in 1970, was won by Bobby Fischer. Its 2023 edition went to Hans Niemann, who then lost no time in comparing himself to his illustrious predecessor, while the 2024 winner was the elite veteran Vasyl Ivanchuk.

Royal’s victory was impressive. He scored 7/9 with six wins, two draws, and only one defeat. He was especially strong in the endgame, winning several times from level positions. The youngster won five of his first six games, establishing a 1.5-point lead before slowing down with draws in the next two rounds, then winning his final game for a full one-point margin over his nearest rival.

The final crosstable shows that Royal had a tournament performance of 2730, elite grandmaster standard. The Greenwich teenager has not been included in this month’s London Classic at the Emirates Stadium, but has surely earned himself a place in the England team for the next Olympiad in Tashkent in September 2026, plus further tournament invitations.

The culture secretary was asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether the BBC board member Robbie Gibb, formerly Theresa May’s communications chief, had overstepped his remit and weighed in on politics.

“There is a real concern, which I share, that political appointments to the board of the BBC damaged confidence and trust in the BBC’s impartiality,” Nandy said.

“That’s something that we will be looking at as part of the charter review, which sets the terms for the BBC for the next decade, and which this government is about to kick off.”

MPs and BBC staff members have called for Gibb to be removed from the corporation’s board as the outgoing director general, Tim Davie, hit out at the “weaponisation” of criticisms of the broadcaster.

The creative industries union Bectu has also demanded the removal of Gibb.

In a letter to Nandy and the BBC board chair Samir Shah, Bectu, the biggest union in the BBC, says Gibb’s position is “a distraction and is untenable”.

The letter says: “It is vital that staff feel that both the government and the BBC board are truly committed to the future of the organisation, its mission, its independence and its values. Given this, we believe that the position of Sir Robbie Gibb on the BBC board has become a distraction and is untenable.

“We simply do not see how staff can have faith in the BBC’s leadership while a crucial position on the board is filled by someone perceived by many staff and external commentators as sympathetic to, or actively part of, a campaign to undermine the BBC and influence its political impartiality.”

Philippa Childs, the head of Bectu, said:“The culture secretary has been very clear in her support for the BBC and its independence. It is time for her to demonstrate that by acting now to ensure the most impartial board possible for the organisation – that means Robbie Gibb has to go.

“Our members have worked incredibly hard to deliver high quality content at a time of cuts and redundancies. They are critical to the delivery of the BBC’s mission and the government must listen to their concerns regarding Gibb’s suitability, to ensure a BBC fit for the next decade and beyond.”

In an online meeting with Davie, BBC staff questioned the position of Gibb, who was appointed to the BBC during Boris Johnson’s time as prime minister.

Several said Gibb and all political appointees should be removed from the body. It has been claimed that Gibb pushed accusations of institutional bias that preceded the shock resignation of Davie and Deborah Turness, the head of BBC News.

Their departures over the weekend followed accusations of bias made in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee. He left that role in the summer.

His memo was leaked to the Daily Telegraph last week and reported over the course of several days. It included criticism of the way a Panorama broadcast edited footage of a Donald Trump speech, which has since led the US president to threaten a $1bn (£760m) legal action. Prescott made a series of other claims of a more general liberal bias at the BBC on issues such as trans rights and Gaza.

While the corporation has acknowledged failings, concern has grown over Gibb’s position on the board, amid suggestions that he played a role in pushing Prescott’s claims and in Prescott being awarded the advisory role. Both Gibb and Prescott have been summoned to give evidence to the Commons culture, media and sport committee.

On Thursday, the BBC apologised to Trump over the editing of the Panorama documentary.

However, the corporation rejected his demands for compensation. His lawyers had threatened to sue unless the BBC issued a retraction, apologised and settled with him.

The BBC has also agreed not to show the edition of Panorama again.

The programme was broadcast a week before the US election. The spliced clip suggested that Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.” The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.",2025-11-14T17:34:28.713877

Charvet Drucker was on a rented 20ft (6 metre) boat near her home on an island in the Salish Sea about 40 miles north-west of Seattle when she spotted a pod of at least eight killer whales, also known as orcas.

The orcas’ coordinated movements and tail slaps suggested they were hunting. Drucker used the zoom lens on her camera to spot a harbor seal that was trying to flee from the pod. One of her shots showed the seal flying through the air above the scrum of orcas frothing the water, and she assumed she was witnessing the seal’s last moments alive.

But as the orcas got closer to the boat, Drucker and her group realized the pod was still chasing the seal. In line with wildlife boating regulations, they had cut the engine to prevent any injury to the whales. The seal clambered out of the water and on to a swimming platform at the stern of the boat near the motor – claiming it as a life raft of sorts.

Wildlife regulations also prohibit touching or interfering with the seal, but Drucker began filming video.

“You poor thing,” Drucker can be heard saying, as the seal looks up at her. “You’re good, just stay, buddy.”

The orcas did not give up immediately, but instead appeared to team up to rock the boat and make the seal fall off. Drucker’s cellphone video shows the orcas lining up and moving in on the boat with staggered dives to create waves. The “wave-washing” technique has been documented by scientists since at least the 1980s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The seal on Drucker’s boat slid off at least once, but managed to climb back on, and the orcas swam away after about 15 minutes.

Drucker has photographed dead seals in the mouths of orcas before, and she says she’s generally happy when the whales get to eat.

“I’m definitely team orca, all day, every day. But once that seal was on the boat, I kind of turned [into] team seal,” she said in an interview with the Associated Press on Thursday.

The killer whales that hunt seals and a diverse set of marine animals in the area are known as Bigg’s or “transient” orcas. They are better fed then other more specialized species like the salmon-focused “resident” orcas who are on the endangered species list, according to Noaa.",2025-11-14T17:34:30.429936

Will wildlife cope?’: Europe’s rush to build energy projects in Chile might not be as green as it seems,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 12:00:44 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"For generations, Alfonso Campos’s family has raised sheep in the grasslands of San Gregorio, a tranquil area in Magallanes province, in the far south of Chile’s Patagonia region. Now, he says, his farm will be encircled by three massive containers of ammonia, a desalination plant, a hydrogen plant, gas pipelines and hundreds of wind turbines.

“If the ammonia leaks, it will poison everything,” he says. “The noise of the windmills will also upset the animals, and the landscape will be turned into an industrial desert.”

We don’t know what megaprojects of this scale will do to the Patagonian ecosystem Carmen Espoz Larraín

European and British firms are investing heavily in green hydrogen megaprojects in Chile, which will convert thousands of square kilometres into windfarms, solar parks and industrial infrastructure. More than 50 green hydrogen projects have been announced by companies across the country, primarily in the southern region of Patagonia and the Atacama desert in northern Chile.

While the developments may seem positive for the world’s transition to clean energy, they have been criticised by Chilean researchers, environmentalists and community leaders, who say they threaten wildlife and jeopardise the livelihoods of farmers and fishing communities.

Green hydrogen is made by putting an electric current through water. If the electricity used is renewable, the hydrogen gas produced is described as “green”. This hydrogen can be combined with carbon to create e-fuels for cars, ships and aeroplanes.

It can also be combined with nitrogen to produce green ammonia, which can be used to manufacture fertilisers, industrial chemicals or explosives, replacing those derived from fossil fuels.

Seeking to accelerate its energy transition, the European Union aims to import 10m tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 and has identified Chile as a key supplier. The president of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, visited Santiago in 2023 to sign a €225m (£192m) agreement to finance green hydrogen projects in Chile. The UK is offering £5bn export credits for green hydrogen projects in the country.

The Austrian-Danish consortium HNH Energy plans to produce more than 1m tonnes of green ammonia a year in a project near Campos’s farm. A few miles north, a subsidiary of the French conglomerate TotalEnergies is investing $16bn (£12bn) in a vast ammonia complex, complete with a desalination plant, an electrolysis unit, a seaport and more than 600 wind turbines on a sprawling site spanning more than 720 sq km (278 sq miles).

Just across the strait of Magellan, on the Tierra del Fuego archipelago, the British firms Hive and TEG are investing $8bn in a green ammonia plant.

The Spanish-German wind turbine firm Acciona Nordex plans to build another green hydrogen plant on Tierra del Fuego island. France’s EDF and Germany’s Porsche are also among the companies investing in green-fuel facilities in Chilean Patagonia. All these projects are awaiting approval from the country’s environmental authority.

It will bring high-quality jobs and we’ll be making a clean source of energy Alejandro Villegas

Chile’s government is enthusiastic about the economic prospects. “We face a historic opportunity to create a world-class industry in Chile that adheres to the highest environmental standards and allows us to contribute to the global effort to reduce carbon emissions,” says Álvaro García, minister of energy and economy.

“One of the challenges we have set for ourselves is to incentivise local demand for green hydrogen, with the resulting benefits for local communities. But to sustain the industry over time, we also need to become exporters of this energy source.”

Luis Alvarado, who heads a hub of small and medium businesses in Magallanes, estimates that if just three projects are approved, 5,000 jobs could be created directly, and tens of thousands more local people will benefit by providing services to the industry.

That is also the hope of Alejandro Villegas, who recently lost his job in the gas industry. “It will be great for the region,” he says. “It will bring high-quality jobs and we’ll be making a clean source of energy.”

So far, only one company, Highly Innovative Fuels (HIF), is producing green hydrogen in Magallanes, through a pilot project featuring one wind turbine and an electrolysis plant, which produces e-methanol and e-fuel (also known as e-gasoline). Although it is majority owned by Chileans, HIF has several international shareholders, including Porsche, Baker Hughes, EIG and Japan’s Idemitsu. Siemens has supplied the technology.

Clara Bowman, HIF’s chief operations officer, says: “The great thing about e-gasoline is that we can start using it today – there’s no need to convert vehicles and you can use existing infrastructure. So we could immediately switch to a climate-friendly fuel.”

The company plans to start producing e-methanol commercially in nearby Cabo Negro, though on a smaller scale than many other planned schemes, using only 60 wind turbines. The company says it will not discharge effluent from its desalination, but will instead reuse water and collect the salt. The turbines also have radar to detect birds.

“We don’t want to overload the ecosystem, so we are taking a phased approach,” says Bowman.

Although export-oriented, HIF will also supply the state oil company with e-fuel. But across Chile, 67% of green hydrogen megaprojects are aimed at the export market and 71% are foreign-owned, according to a Guardian analysis.

Despite some people’s optimism regarding the economic impact of the green hydrogen boom, researchers, environmentalists and community leaders warn that Chile’s massive commitment to green energy will come at a high environmental cost.

Carmen Espoz Larraín, a marine biologist at a research centre in Bahía Lomas in Tierra del Fuego, notes that the waters of the Magellan Strait form a fragile ecosystem, home to many whale species, including orcas, humpback, sei and minke whales, as well as sea lions and dolphins.

“Each of these projects has a desalination plant which will discharge water with an extremely high salt content and coagulants back into the sea. This will affect all the marine life, as well as the birds that feed here,” she says.

The Chilean government aims to produce 13% of the world’s green hydrogen just in the region of Magallanes and Antarctica. Espoz Larraín says that means windfarms and industrial infrastructure would cover 20,000 sq km of land here.

“We simply don’t know what megaprojects of this scale will do to the ecosystem of the Patagonian steppes,” she says. “All these green fuels are for export; they won’t benefit us. It’s green colonialism, using Chilean natural resources for a so-called green transition in the global north.”

We are a fishing community … We don’t want a dead seabed, bleached white by the salt Brenda Gutiérrez

Ricardo Matus, an ornithologist who manages the Leñadura Bird Rehabilitation Centre in the Magallanes region, says tens of thousands of birds migrate to Patagonia, including the critically endangered Magellanic plover, the red knot and the ruddy-headed goose.

His organisation is one of 12 environmental groups that have formed the H2 Citizens Panel of Magallanes to urge the authorities not to rush into large-scale green hydrogen projects.

“Windfarms on this scale could decimate the bird population, as they collide with the blades,” Matus says.

In the arid Antofagasta region of northern Chile, extensive areas will be transformed into solar parks if more than 20 planned green hydrogen projects gain environmental approval. The US company AES, for example, is investing in a green ammonia complex that will need three solar farms to supply it with energy, and it is one of green fuel projects planned for the Taltal area.

García, the energy minister, says civil society concerns should be considered, but insists: “We have a very robust system of environmental safeguards and have worked diligently to regulate the establishment of this industry, guaranteeing the protection of the environment and ecosystems.”

Valentina Durán, director of Chile’s environmental assessment authority, says the government must verify that projects comply with environmental regulations, while also mitigating and compensating for their effects.

Yet, in Taltal, local Indigenous communities do not appear reassured by the state’s guarantees and voice concerns about the foreign companies’ arrival.

Brenda Gutiérrez, president of the Indigenous community of Pabla Almendares de Peralito, Salitre y Paposo, based in Taltal, says no one knows the impact of covering the desert with solar panels. “Will it change the weather? How will the wildlife cope?” she asks.

Yet, Gutiérrez says, her community is certain that it will be directly affected by the desalination plants discharging effluents along the Taltal coast. “We are a fishing community. We fish, collect seaweed and harvest shellfish.

“We don’t want a dead seabed, bleached white by the salt and chemicals,” she says. “The sea is our life.”",2025-11-14T17:34:32.910677

Millions of tiny, toxic plastic beads are thought to have escaped into the sea from Eastbourne sewage works in East Sussex about two weeks ago when a screen keeping them in broke. They began to wash up on Camber Sands beach last Thursday, with the situation worsening over the weekend.

Environment Agency sources suspect this is one of England’s worst plastic pollution events, with approximately 10 tonnes of beads spilled: the plastic pollution campaign group Strandliners has estimated it is probably about 650m beads.

“This is catastrophic,” Sarah Broadbent, who chairs the 1066 Country tourist board, told the meeting attended by hundreds of local people, Southern Water representatives, and the area’s MP Helena Dollimore. “We really rely on tourists here, who come for the beach. We will be at the bottom of everybody’s holiday list now.”

She and other local people depended on the beach for their happiness and mental health, she said: “The beach is a factor in everyone’s lives here. This is catastrophic for us.”

Richard Oakes, the local Environment Agency officer, told the meeting he expected the incident could be upgraded to a category 1 pollution event, the most serious kind.

He confirmed that the beads had been found along the coast, from Hastings to Dungeness, and also inside Rye Harbour. The harbour nature reserve, a site of special scientific interest, is loved by local people, with its big skies and the salt marshes popular with wading birds, and it had been hoped the beads would not penetrate that far.

When Oakes confirmed the beads were being found in the salt marsh there, the people in the room let out a sad sigh. There were whispers of “no”.

“What I am really worried about,” said Dollimore, “is when birds start washing up dead on the reserve. I think that will be extremely upsetting.”

Anthony Skinner, who runs a kitesurfing company at Camber Sands, is one of the 175 people who have spent days on their hands and knees using sieves, tweezers and dustpans and brushes to try to clean the beach. He and other people turned up to the meeting to get some answers from the water company and the Environment Agency.

“I was one of the first on the site,” said Skinner, “I’ve been raking the seaweed to expose the beads underneath. Our beauty spot has been tainted, it will change people’s perception of the coast. We were already dealing with sewage and runoff from the roads, now we have to cope with this pollution too.”

Hastings and Rye is the most deprived constituency in East Sussex and heavily relies on its tourist industry. There are also concerns the spill will hit the already struggling fishing industry, as the beads are toxic to marine life. “The fishers are having a hard time already, and now they have these toxic beads to put up with,” said the mayor of Rye, Andy Stuart.

Southern Water customers this year received the highest bill increase in the country, with rates rising by an average of 47%. This feels like a double injustice to those dealing with pollution from the company.

John Penicud, the managing director of wastewater at Southern Water, told the meeting that the Eastbourne treatment site was old, “built in the year 2000” and that a screen on the tank holding tonnes of plastic beads, which are used to filter sewage water, had broken. He added that five other Southern Water treatment centres used these beads.

He said the company was “really sorry” for the spill and committed to paying for the cleanup, but confirmed some of the money for this would come from customer bills. Penicud said it would be paid for with a “mixture of funds” – investment from shareholders and customer bills.

He said new treatment sites no longer used the beads, only sites built in the 1990s and 2000s. “In our new plant construction since the early 2000s we don’t use beads any more. We use something called membrane technology.”

While it will be impossible to completely remove all of the hundreds of millions of beads, the people at Camber continue to work to find as many as they can. “We are very upset at what’s happened. We feel very strongly about it,” said Dollimore. “I think the incident is probably one of the biggest plastic pollution incidents in this country ever, definitely one of the biggest on the south coast of England in history. And it’s really serious.”",2025-11-14T17:34:36.948221

Four activists came together with the aim of promoting good environmental practices in local agriculture and business, as well as supplying renewable energy. The project, however, was about much more than growing vegetables.

The town has a strong tradition of community action, and as the initiative gathered momentum, the activists formed a cooperative, Taradell Sostenible, which now has 111 members and supplies power to more than 100 households. These include some of the area’s most vulnerable citizens, says Eugeni Vila, the coop’s president. “The question was how could people with few resources join the coop when membership costs €100,” says Vila. “We agreed that people designated as poor by the local authority could join for only €25 and thus benefit from the cheap electricity we generate.”

Taradell Sostenible have installed solar panels on the roofs of a sports centre and a cultural centre to supply electricity to the community, with funding from the government’s Institute for the Diversification and Saving of Energy (IDAE), which is working to expand energy communities across the country.

“We’re very proud of the fact that IDAE describes us as pioneers,” says Vila. “The EU’s Next Generation funding, which we got through IDAE, helped us to complete these two projects.”

Once they were up and running, they realised they needed more professional management, so in 2022 they combined forces with other local energy communities.

Renewable energy is flourishing in Spain, a country with no gas or oil and little coal of its own, but an abundance of sunshine. For years, solar installation was held back by the notorious “sunshine tax” introduced in 2015. Rather than reward individuals for installing solar power, the government taxed them after the big power companies successfully argued that energy self-sufficiency amounted to unfair competition.

That tax was abolished in 2018, and energy self-sufficiency, mainly through photovoltaic panels, has increased 17-fold, according to the IDAE. The institute is now turning its attention from subsidising solar installations on individual homes to prioritising energy communities such as Taradell, with initial funding of €148.5m (£130m) earmarked for 200 projects.

Environmentalists have long advocated the spread of energy communities, in which solar panels on the rooftops of government buildings, warehouses and sports facilities supply electricity to nearby homes and business. Until recently, this was limited to a 500 metres radius, but that limit has now been extended to 2,000 metres – and it is taking off across the country, thanks to government support channeled through the IDAE.

The institute’s policy aims to bring cheap electricity to households suffering from pobreza energética (fuel poverty) who cannot afford the upfront cost of installing solar panels – typically €5,000-6,000 for each household.

The institute defines fuel poverty as low-income, energy-inefficient households where a high proportion of income is spent on energy supply.

As well as fostering the development of energy communities, the IDAE encourages the communities to talk to each other, to form a patchwork of autonomous but integrated groups. Taradell has now teamed up with two nearby energy communities in Balenyà and La Tonenca.

“We’ve developed a formula to help people who are struggling to get by through incorporating them into a network that helps them to improve their situation,” he says. “We’ve taken advantage of the EU Sun4All scheme to develop a system to assess who are the vulnerable families, and not just in terms of fuel poverty.” The Sun4All project, which finished last year, was an EU project supporting solar power projects that helped low income families.

On the other side of the country, 1,150km (715 miles) away, the island of Ons off Spain’s Atlantic coast is also in line to benefit from the new IDAE policy. Ons, population 92, will soon be able to do away with the generator that has been its only source of electricity and replace it with solar power.

“With these subsidies, we’re going to install solar panels on the local authority buildings to supply energy to the islanders, most of whom are elderly and vulnerable,” said José Antonio Fernández Bouzas, the head of the Atlantic Islands national park.

The Galician regional government has already installed solar panels on the nearby Cíes Islands, helping local businesses to dispense with diesel-run generators.

“These are protected areas and we want them to be self-sufficient in energy,” Bouzas said.

In addition to supplying cheap and clean electricity, localised energy communities reduce the transportation costs and pollution associated with large solar and wind farms. They also make a lot of sense in a country where 65% of the population live in apartment blocks rather than individual houses.

This localised, community approach may also make the country’s grid system less vulnerable to events such as the massive blackout on April 28 this year which left all of Spain and Portugal without electricity for most of the day.",2025-11-14T17:34:38.690921

The chancellor has decided to freeze the level at which people start paying income tax for two years, according to government sources, rather than breaking a manifesto promise and putting rates up, as had been planned for several weeks.

The last-minute decision to change tack came during a turbulent week for the government and amid concerted pressure from senior Labour MPs. It sparked a sell-off in the markets as investors pushed government borrowing costs higher and the pound lower.

Downing Street said on Friday: “The chancellor has been clear on the need to deliver stability in the public finances. As she said last week, one of the objectives of the budget is to build more resilient public finances with the headroom to withstand global turbulence.”

The Treasury declined to comment on budget speculation but sources familiar with government deliberations said the decision to switch approach had come on Wednesday after talks between Reeves and Keir Starmer.

Officials said the change had been made because official forecasts showed Reeves’ fiscal black hole was closer to £20bn than £30bn, allowing her to take less radical steps to raise money.

Instead of raising income tax rates, a move heavily hinted at by Reeves in recent days, the chancellor has decided to freeze thresholds for two years, a move that economists estimate will raise £7.5bn.

The decision comes a year after Reeves argued against exactly such a move. She said in her 2024 budget speech: “Extending the threshold freeze would hurt working people, it would take more money out of their payslips.”

Other likely tax rises include a move to end tax breaks for salary sacrifice pension schemes, raising about £2bn, and a new tax on electric vehicles, also estimated to raise £2bn.

The decision not to raise income tax rates was taken after weeks of careful planning for just such a move, including briefing Labour MPs on why difficult decisions would need to be taken to balance the government books.

Government insiders said the decision was taken on Wednesday, the same day the prime minister was forced to deny reports that his aides had briefed against the health secretary, Wes Streeting, in an attempt to shore up his own position.

Streeting welcomed the decision on Friday, having warned earlier in the week that breaking the manifesto pledge risked losing the trust of voters.

He told LBC Radio: “I’m not in favour of breaking manifesto pledges. I think that trust in politics and politicians is low and it’s part of our responsibility to not only rebuild our economy and rebuild our public services but to rebuild trust in politics itself.”

Other cabinet ministers are also understood to have expressed concerns about the political implications of raising income tax rates.

Some MPs, however, argued that the late change risked giving the impression that the government was not in control. One senior Labour MP said they thought Reeves “will end up having to go after this debacle of a budget” and warned against any further attempt to U-turn on ending the two-child benefit limit, saying that would “lead to a complete revolt”.

Another Labour MP said Starmer had been told by many in the parliamentary party this week that he was losing the room but he “refused to listen to criticism”. “They don’t know what they are doing and there is 10 days left of this mess,” they said.

That assessment was underlined by a turbulent day in the markets, with UK government bonds on track for their worst day since 2 July, when investors responded to a tearful appearance by Reeves in the House of Commons chamber. Meanwhile, the pound dropped against the dollar.

Kathleen Brooks, a research director at the brokerage XTB, said: “Bond market volatility is not what the chancellor wants to see with less than two weeks to go before the budget.

“Essentially, the bond market is warning the chancellor that she cannot merely tax the ‘rich’ to fund her lavish spending pledges. Either she broadens the tax base or she cuts spending.”

Ruth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation and a former Treasury tax and spending official, said it was normal for the OBR’s forecasts to change in the run-up to the budget. However, she said “excessive levels of kite flying” were fuelling market volatility.

“It is not normal for so much of that to be laid bare in public,” she said. “The market moves this morning and in recent weeks suggest a serious look should be taken at the approach to market-sensitive forecast information.”",2025-11-14T17:34:40.447502
7447e1dd2a735b8c0fdbbd86eb0250063b482b14,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/14/flu-mutated-strain-uk-hospitals-winter-surge,UK hospitals bracing for once-in-a-decade flu surge this winter,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:03:53 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"Hospitals are bracing for a once-in-a-decade flu season, with a mutated version of the virus that is spreading widely in younger people expected to drive a wave of admissions when it reaches the elderly.

The threat has prompted NHS managers to redouble efforts to vaccinate staff and communities, expand same-day emergency care and treat more patients in the community to reduce the need for hospital stays.

As resident doctors in England continue a five-day strike over pay, hospitals are turning to contingency plans to bring in consultants and other staff for extra shifts and reschedule appointments where necessary.

“Last flu season was particularly nasty and we’re very concerned that this year could be even worse,” said Elaine Clancy, the group chief nursing officer for St George’s, Epsom and St Helier university hospitals. “We’re preparing for a spike of flu on to our wards.”

Scientists first spotted the mutated version of the flu virus in June. Genetic analysis shows it is a descendant of a strain that this year fuelled Australia’s worst flu season on record. The country recorded more than 400,000 lab-confirmed cases, with low vaccination rates compounding the problem.

The mutated virus, which changed through a natural process called antigenic drift, has swiftly become the dominant strain in the UK, triggering the start of the flu season more than a month earlier than usual.

Dr Claire Beynon, the executive director of public health for Cardiff and Vale university health board, said: “We are seeing a rapid and early increase in influenza this winter and are expecting to see an increase in hospital admissions.”

A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said flu numbers across its sites were normal for the time of year, but that it was implementing efforts to relieve pressure on hospitals “at pace”.

Flu cases surge every winter, but health officials fear this season could be particularly severe if the new mutations in the dominant strain help it to evade people’s immune defences.

The virus is a subtype of influenza called H3N2, which tends to cause more severe illness than other subtypes in circulation, particularly in older people. The mutations may boost the virus’s transmissibility. It is too early to know if they make infections more severe.

In a normal flu season, the R value, which is the average number of people an infected person passes the virus on to, is around 1.1 to 1.2. This season it is thought to be 1.4, meaning every 100 people with flu are expected to infect a further 140.

“Whenever there is an early start to the season, there tends to be a bigger peak,” said Antonia Ho, a professor in infectious diseases at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research. One reason is that fewer people have been vaccinated when they come into contact with the virus.

On Thursday, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said flu cases continued to increase overall, despite a temporary slowing due to the school half-term break. Infections are highest in children but are creeping up in older people. Health officials expect the numbers to rise further as colder weather drives more mixing indoors.

“The new strain of flu is a worry on what was already predicted to be a big flu season,” said Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK. “It is more important than ever that everyone that is eligible – including older people – gets the flu vaccine and also takes precautions to stay well this winter.”

Early data from the UKHSA suggest that current vaccines are less effective at blocking infections caused by the mutated flu virus, but still provide good protection against severe disease. In England, vaccine effectiveness against hospital attendance and admissions is within normal range so far at 70-75% in children and 30-40% in adults.

While H3N2 can cause severe flu seasons, it is not inevitable. In 2003-24, the season started early with a drifted H3N2 strain. It led to 12,000 flu deaths in England and Wales, at the lower end of the typical range.

Ho urged all who are eligible to take up the vaccine offer and encouraged others to consider paying for the shot and using lateral flow tests to check for flu infections. According to the UKHSA, less than a third of people with one or more long-term health conditions have come forward for the vaccine.

Ed Hutchinson, a professor of molecular and cellular virology at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, said it was “quite plausible” the UK was on course for its most severe flu season in a decade.

“This has the potential to mean large numbers of people needing hospital treatment, particularly people in at-risk groups, notably older adults, but also people with underlying conditions, pregnant women, and very young children,” he said.",2025-11-14T17:34:42.182174
eb1daa0559db9336cebb8d89c25079eece92830c,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/nov/14/redbird-capital-drops-telegraph-bid-newspaper,RedBird Capital drops £500m Telegraph takeover bid,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:35:49 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"RedBird Capital has dropped its £500m bid for the Telegraph Media Group, throwing the future of its daily and Sunday titles into further uncertainty.

The private equity group founded by Gerry Cardinale has been under intense attack in recent weeks with the Telegraph newsroom – and allies including the former editor Charles Moore and the ex-Spectator chief Fraser Nelson – publishing a string of pieces calling for its links to China to be investigated.

Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, had been expected to announce a decision imminently on whether to let the bid progress and also if it should be subject to scrutiny by the media regulator, Ofcom, and the competition watchdog.

“RedBird has today withdrawn its bid for the Telegraph Media Group (TMG),” a spokesperson for RedBird Capital Partners said. “We remain fully confident that the Telegraph and its world-class team have a bright future ahead of them and will work hard to secure a solution which is in the best interests of employees and readers.”

The Daily Telegraph editor, Chris Evans, told staff: “You’ll have seen the news about the sale. On the one hand, it’s no secret that I, all the senior editors and many of our writers had concerns about this bid.

“On the other hand, it’s also obvious that this process has gone on far, far too long. The Telegraph deserves owners who care about journalism and who will invest. We will do our best to ensure this process ends as soon as possible – with a buyer who shares our passion and our ambition for The Telegraph.”

RedBird Capital had been the only prospective buyer willing to structure a deal at the £500m value desired by the consortium RedBird IMI – a joint venture between RedBird and the UAE’s International Media Investments (IMI) – which took control of TMG in 2023 by providing a loan to pay its former owners, the Barclay family, unpaid debts to Lloyds bank.

RedBird IMI was forced to put the papers up for sale in April last year after the government legislated against foreign state ownership of UK newspaper assets. IMI is controlled by Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates and the owner of Manchester City FC.

RedBird Capital had put together a deal that would have led to IMI retaining a 15% stake, after Labour eased the ban on foreign governments owning stakes in UK newspapers, and the owner of the Daily Mail and the billionaire Sir Leonard Blavatnik, with each likely to hold about a 10% stake.

The potential sale, agreed in principle in May, was thrown into doubt last month when the Telegraph newspaper itself linked its presumed new owner to the suspected ringleader of an alleged Chinese spy ring in Westminster.

The Daily Telegraph published a 2024 photograph of the chair of RedBird Capital, John Thornton, shaking hands with Cai Qi, a senior member of the Chinese Communist party’s ruling politburo, raising questions as to whether the British title was being lined up as a conduit for China to exert influence.

Cai has been described as the top lieutenant of China’s president, Xi Jinping, and has been revealed as the suspected recipient of intelligence about British politics that formed part of the collapsed Chinese spying prosecution.

In August, a group of nine human rights and freedom of expression organisations wrote to Nandy, urging her to halt the proposed RedBird Capital takeover and investigate the US private equity company’s ties to China.

They pointed to the fact Thornton sits on the advisory council of the China Investment Corporation, the country’s largest sovereign wealth fund, and has also previously chaired the Silk Road Finance Corporation.

A spokesperson for RedBird denied any Chinese involvement or influence in the proposed acquisition of the Telegraph.

An IMI spokesperson said: “Throughout this process our priority has been to end the uncertainty and secure the Telegraph’s long-term success. We have remained in contact with a number of other parties, interest in the titles remains strong. IMI will continue to cooperate closely with the government and regulators to progress a sale.”

Anna Jones, the TMG chief executive, said: “I will now work with the board of independent directors on next steps and what this means for the future ownership of the business.

“This process has been challenging and unpredictable but your hard work and continued patience is a credit to you all.”",2025-11-14T17:34:44.044943

Jonathan Jarvis claimed the agency is now in the hands of a “bunch of ideologues” who would have no issue watching it “go down in flames” – and see parks from Yellowstone to Yosemite as potential “cash cows”, ripe for privatization.

Jarvis, who led the NPS from 2009 to 2017, faced intense scrutiny, a five-hour grilling in Congress and calls for his resignation after closing all 401 national park sites during a previous shutdown, in October 2013.

He was certain, despite the backlash, that it was the right thing to do: keeping them open with a skeleton staff would have put parks and their visitors at risk, his team concluded.

Over the past month, hundreds of NPS veterans including Jarvis, 72, have watched aghast as most of the agency’s workers were furloughed during the longest shutdown in US history – while the Trump administration kept all national parks open.

There have been consequences.

A fire at Joshua Tree national park burnt through some 72 acres. Yosemite faced a wave of illegal Base jumping. Yellowstone grappled with bear jams.

Vandalism included graffiti in Arches national park. A stone wall at Gettysburg national military park was damaged. Trash started to gather at various sites.

Thousands of NPS workers are typically around to guide visitors safely through parks, point them in the right direction, swiftly rescue them from danger, keep traffic moving, monitor wildlife and protect the landscape.

“You take all of that away – all of those employees – you basically are, on one hand, creating unsafe conditions for the visitor,” Jarvis said, adding: “And you’re putting basically these irreplaceable resources at risk.”

Doug Burgum, the interior secretary, was warned by more than 40 former national park superintendents in September that parks were “in jeopardy” while open during a shutdown. More than 450 former national park officials followed up last month, urging Burgum again to close the parks. Both letters went unanswered.

Contacted for comment, the Department of the Interior – which oversees the NPS – said Trump had “worked tirelessly” to minimize the impact of the shutdown. “It’s easy to criticize from the sidelines, but the reality is that the administration prioritized stability, safety, and service to the American people,” a spokesperson said.

“During this shutdown, the administration made deliberate, lawful decisions to protect essential operations that sustain America’s energy security, economic stability, and public safety,” the spokesperson said. “Activities that continued were those necessary to preserve critical infrastructure, safeguard natural resources, and prevent disruption to key supply chains that millions of Americans rely on.”

‘They’re not doing anything’

Now the shutdown is over, after 42 days, Jarvis said service staff will “bust their butts” to clean up US national parks. But he remains concerned about the lasting impacts.

Take trash. In mountain parks, from Rocky Mountain to Mount Rainier, black and grizzly bears are currently fattening up to go into hibernation: a particularly important time to ensure they don’t access garbage, and become attracted to human food.

“They will feed on it, and become habituated, and the end result of a habituated bear is either somebody gets hurt, or the bear gets killed,” said Jarvis. “By not picking up trash in the parks, letting it accumulate, fall out of the cans ... you’re setting up for an impact down the road.

“And these are things that the administration could care less about, frankly, because obviously they’re not doing anything about it.”

The NPS was founded in 1916 to both promote the use of national parks and monuments and conserve them for the enjoyment of future generations. Under Trump, its workforce has reportedly shrunk by as much as 24% amid hundreds of layoffs. Thousands more staff have resigned or retired, either out of choice or due to pressure.

The agency remains without a permanent director, and did not have one for the duration of Trump’s first term.

“I don’t get it,” said Jarvis. “I don’t get why you would mess up something that is highly popular with the American people, unless you’ve got just sort of an axe to grind.”

Inside the Department of the Interior, he divides officials appointed by Trump into two camps. Some are trying to set the NPS “up to fail” as a pretext for privatizing some of the nation’s most popular parks, he claimed, while others are focused on “facade management”: preserving the jobs of staff in visible roles, like rangers, while cutting “everything else behind the scenes”, from scientists and paleontologists to historians and landscape architects.

But backroom staff are critical at the NPS, according to Jarvis. These are the people who craft the trails, design the maps and guides, treat the water, restore the meadows, tackle the non-native plants and monitor for disease among the wildlife. “All of that activity that goes on behind the scenes is what raises the quality of the experience, and the quality of the stewardship of the resource.”

Conservationists fear that selling off national parks, or allowing companies to take control of key elements, would undermine decades of work to protect them. “The private sector can do entertainment very well,” said Jarvis. “But the profit motive is not there for conservation.”

“I’ve been to Disneyland. I’ve been to Disney World,” he continued. “They love ripping off the park service. They’ll have a fake ​geyser. They’ll have all kinds of entertaining kinds of things. But it’s not real.

“And I think the value proposition here for the parks is that this is real. Those are real wildlife. That’s a real bison. And it’s not behind a fence. I think the private sector would muck it up.”

Despite concerns over the fate of the NPS under Trump, Jarvis is confident that broad, bipartisan support will shield the agency from the most extreme plans for its future.

“I don’t think Congress will let the administration get away with completely dismantling the park service,” he said. “But I do think the Trump administration will continue to try.”

‘Raise hell’

Americans can help protect national parks and the service that has overseen them for more than a century, Jarvis said, by calling up their representatives in Congress, and by donating to advocacy or philanthropic support groups.

“They can volunteer,” he suggested, and help clean up parks after the shutdown. “There’s going to be a big mess,” said Jarvis. Several hundred thousand volunteers show up at national parks each year.

“And then,” he added, “raise hell! Stand out there with everybody else, and their signs. Just because we’re going back to work here, with the shutdown [over], doesn’t mean this nightmare is over. They still have big designs on hurting this stewardship institution.”",2025-11-14T17:34:45.888125

Now researchers say internet searches for the anti-anxiety drug surged after the show’s release.

Lorazepam, also known by its brand name Ativan, is a type of drug known as a benzodiazepine, or “benzo”. It is thought to work by boosting the effect of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain.

Researchers in the US say the name-dropping of lorazepam on The White Lotus has fuelled a rise in interest around the drug and how to access it.

Dr Olivia Maynard of the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the study, described the data as striking.

“That this TV show is causing people to explore purchasing benzodiazepines online is particularly concerning because there is a huge amount of illicit production of benzodiazepines, and these drugs are often dosed incorrectly and/or inconsistently and sometimes contain different drugs entirely,” she said.

“Recently, some illicit ‘benzodiazepines’ which people have bought online have been found to contain nitazenes, a dangerous synthetic opioid, which could lead to overdose or even death if taken.”

Researchers at the University of California San Diego analysed data from Google, finding that, while searches for lorazepam were stable from January 2022 to the end of the first week of February 2025, they surged after the third season of The White Lotus was released on 16 February and remained at increased levels for the next 12 weeks.

Overall, the team say there were almost twice as many searches relating to lorazepam over this 12-week period than would normally be expected, equating to about 1.6m additional searches.

There was also an increase in the number of searches about how to get hold of lorazepam, with such queries about 64% higher than expected for the 12-week period – reflecting about 30,000 extra searches.

However, no such spikes were seen for searches related to alprazolam or clonazepam – benzodiazepines not mentioned in The White Lotus.

While the study, published in the journal JAMA Health Forum, cannot unpick whether people were simply searching for information about lorazepam or buying the drug, the researchers say the results raise concerns given the rise in prescribing of such medications and the increase in illegitimate online pharmacies selling benzodiazepines without prescriptions.

The researchers also warn The White Lotus did not portray the risks of suddenly stopping lorazepam – noting this can cause panic attacks, agitation, and seizures – or convey the dangers of drinking alcohol while taking benzodiazepines. As the NHS website notes: “It can make you sleep very deeply. You may have breathing problems and difficulty waking up.”

The researchers say the entertainment industry should develop ‘best practice’ approaches to how prescription medications are shown, adding the use of health information panels could sate curiosity.

Harry Sumnall, a professor of substance use at Liverpool John Moores University, said that, while signposting to further advice and support is sometimes included at the end of shows, there are other approaches to keeping viewers safe.

“Whilst it could be useful if entertainment shows incorporated health advice where potentially harmful products are prominent, I don’t think this is realistic to expect from a creative point of view, and there is the risk that heavy-handed warnings can lead to counterproductive outcomes,” he said.

“Where access to medicines is concerned, I think the greatest impacts will be seen through enforcement action against illicit manufacturers and unregulated providers, and prescriber education, as over-[prescribing] or inappropriate prescribing of clinically useful but potentially harmful medicines remains a concern.”",2025-11-14T17:34:47.742281

The man himself sits back in the cavernous workshop behind the theatre building, dapper in a grey plaid suit. “I loved that,” he says gleefully.

When the Hollywood star was announced as the new artistic director of Scotland’s only major rural theatre last September, there was widespread shock – not least that Cumming answered an open recruitment call – followed by feverish speculation over which A-list pals he might charm away from London or New York to perform in Highland Perthshire.

I imagine staff thought I’d be like Godzilla – stomping on things

But with the public unwrapping of his first season, it is apparent that Cumming has done so much more than call in favours – it’s a programme of imagination and creative rigour, putting big names in unexpected collaborations alongside undersung Scottish talent. “There’s always this binary of bringing in more well-known people – creatives, not just actors – but also to celebrate and nurture our indigenous talents.”

He arranges himself, at 60, with a dancer’s poise though his puckish side-eye suggests there’s plenty of mischief still to be made. The season showcases Cumming himself a fair bit, too. He writes, directs or performs in four shows, closing the year as Henry Higgins in a revival of My Fair Lady. The season opens with another musical: the Scottish premiere of Once, featuring the original Broadway creative team led by director John Tiffany. Then there is the world premiere of a new work by lauded dramatist Martin Sherman, starring Simon Russell Beale and directed by Cumming. Elsewhere, award-winning Scottish actor Sally Reid pivots to directing, as National Theatre of Scotland stalwarts Adura Onashile and Sandy Grierson star in her staging of another world premiere: Douglas Maxwell’s new comedy Inexperience.

“There’s got to be a reason why,” says Cumming, who has lost none of his precise Scots inflection despite spending many of his recent years in New York, where he lives with his husband, illustrator Grant Shaffer. “I’m not just going to put on nice plays.” In addition: “Every single one of these shows has a personal connection to me.”

The north star of Cumming’s creative constellation might well be the actor Maureen Beattie, who visited his Angus primary school when he was eight years old “and changed my life”. Beattie is to play Lear in a bold reinterpretation of Shakespeare’s mad king, directed by Finn den Hertog, lately acclaimed for staging David Ireland’s The Fifth Step. “We’ve seen Lear so often with boring old men,” says Cumming, “and when I spoke to Maureen, I realised how fascinating and how different it would be as a story about a woman and her daughters.”

The season also has star-spangled weekend festivals, the literary Winter Words and Out in the Hills, a celebration of all things LGBTQ+ and bringing together Armistead Maupin, Graham Norton and Evelyn Glennie in January. For Cumming, a committed advocate for LGBTQ+ rights who has followed the “huge backlash” against transgender people in recent years in the US and the UK, the motivation for programming a queer-specific event is simple enough: “I felt like it would be really good for trans and queer people to be mentioned in our news without a negative connotation – and we should celebrate, remind people of what a great contribution LGBTQ+ people have made to our lives.”

It’s not, of course, unheard of for creatives to travel for work, but he acknowledges that Pitlochry, a thriving tourist destination known as the Gateway to the Highlands, is off the beaten theatrical track: “Big time! It’s a commitment.”

The setting itself is breathtaking. Not for nothing is Perthshire nicknamed Big Tree Country. On the day I visit, the gardens set back from the banks of the River Tummel are painted in vivid autumn colours and hazy with mist rolling down from Ben Vrackie, the quartz-spiked mountain that looms to the north. On a direct train line from Glasgow and Edinburgh, it’s a couple of hours’ winding through pine-fringed hills.

“You come away from all the normal glare to this beautiful place, with these great facilities and you make work,” says Cumming. “You show it here and then you take it somewhere else – I want the shows to go to other parts of the world after their runs here. People really get that model.”

He adds: “People will come for just over two months. You’re able to be more focused here, it’s beautiful and it’s an adventure – like camp.” His eyebrows bounce above thick black spectacle frames.

There’s a sense that he relishes having something of an ambassadorial role for the country he says “could be better at self-confidence”. Cumming is a longtime supporter of Scottish independence and played his part in the Yes campaign of 2014. “I do love my country and I really understand the gifts it’s given me. So sometimes I come back and think, ‘Come on, everybody! Things are great here.’”

He is also an advocate of manifestation, using the power of thought to shape reality. He tells a lovely – and entirely true – story about the theatre’s founder, John Stewart, who hid a slip of paper in a wayside post by the river on a wartime visit, pledging: “When peace is declared I shall return to this spot to give thanks to God and to establish my festival.” On VE Day, he recovered his note and the theatre was established 75 years ago this year. “When I started,” says Cumming, “I set out what my aims were, so I feel like that is something I share with him.”

Whatever your take on mysticism and prophesy fulfilment, this is an approach that aligns with the surroundings – Highland Perthshire is one of the most arcane parts of Scotland, steeped in folklore and ancient history. On my trip back to Glasgow, I take a detour to the nearby Dunfallandy Stone, a rare Pictish carved stone depicting a human head clasped by a fish-tailed monster.

But what’s also supremely evident is Cumming’s clear-eyed and straightforward determination to make this work. His tenure comes at a point of soaring confidence for Scottish theatre, with new leadership at Glasgow’s Tron and Edinburgh’s Lyceum, alongside the much-anticipated refurbishment of the Citizens in Glasgow. Cumming has attended a couple of dinners with other artistic directors, benefiting from the wealth of experience round the table. “I’m totally new to the business and the machinations behind the scenes of running a charity. And I can ask, ‘Is this normal?’”

Cumming introduces his first programmed season as artistic director

Cynics might question how much a man with a plethora of strings to his bow, who still divides his time between New York and another base near Inverness, can be involved in the daily grind of running an arts venue. “It’s been challenging,” Cumming admits. “I’ve worked mostly remotely this year.” And he praises the team around him: “It’s much more work than I thought it was going to be, in the minutiae and also dealing with so many personalities.”

This works in both directions, he suggests. “When I arrived, I didn’t know them, but they thought they knew me. When you’re famous, you’ve got to …” He mimes unpicking something. “I imagine they thought I’d be like Godzilla, going through Pitlochry and stomping on things.”

Pitlochry is a space familiar with innovation – previous director Elizabeth Newman built up its artistic credibility with new writing, inventive staging and collaboration with other producing houses. “I’ve been conscious of not being completely jarring and changing everything,” he says, nodding to the strong musical component of his season, “a big part of what people have of late associated with Pitlochry”.

But the famous repertory system – the only one left in Scotland – has gone. “It wasn’t financially viable,” says Cumming, “and a prerequisite of me taking this job was that we had to be able to ask people to come for a shorter time.” Cumming certainly has a close eye on the theatre’s fiscal health, establishing partnerships with nearby hotels and even choosing to forgo his own salary. He can probably afford it. As well as his work as an actor on stage and screen, Cumming presents the US version of The Traitors and owns a bar, Club Cumming, in New York City. He is hoping the cash saved can go towards fixing the amphitheatre’s stage.

Since his appointment, Cumming has repeatedly spoken about wanting the theatre building to be a venue for the local community as well as paying audiences. “I want it to become known as this international theatre destination for audiences and for artists, and the community’s got to come along with that because they’re part of it.”

Earlier today, he dropped in on the weekly sketching club, which congregates in the theatre’s open-plan cafe area. “I said, ‘Oh, you’ve grown. There’s more of you since I was last here!’ It makes the building feel alive, especially at times when we don’t have shows on. I actually think the experience you have in this building is as important as what we put on our stages.”

And earlier this year, at the close of the Winter Words festival, he DJ-ed at a huge party, inviting the whole town to attend. “And they came!” he says delightedly. “It was a magical night.”",2025-11-14T17:34:51.928511

Before the Nazi war-crime trials at Nuremberg that started in November 1945, an obscure US army psychiatrist called Dr Douglas Kelley was ordered to interview the prisoners, chief among whom was Hermann Göring. This was supposedly to establish their fitness for trial, but was really intended to gain inside information as to how they would conduct their defence. Russell Crowe is rather wittily cast as the portly, pompous Reichsmarschall Göring; it’s the best he’s been for a long time, a sly and cunning manipulator playing psychological cat-and-mouse with the Americans.

But there is a deeply silly performance from Rami Malek as Kelley: an eye-rolling, enigmatic-smiling, scenery-nibbling hamfest which makes it look as if Malek is auditioning for the role of Hitler in The Producers. Leo Woodall plays the American army translator Howie Triest, Michael Shannon is the US chief prosecutor Robert H Jackson and Richard E Grant is British Tory MP David Maxwell-Fyfe who (for all that his postwar career as home secretary was notorious for the homophobic persecution, which helped drive Alan Turing to his grave), is actually shown to be crucial in cross-examining the Nazis. All of these actors do their best, but the figure of Kelley himself is a ridiculous cartoon.

Granted, the real Kelley does seem to have been a mercurial figure who made no secret of wanting to write a book about the trial, which he hoped would be his ticket to glory. But the film also wants to make him a conventionally decent hero, and can’t really accommodate much (or any) plausible nuance. Malek’s Kelley is a bag of actorly tricks, speckled with twitchy mannerisms; he doesn’t look all that different from the Bond villain Malek once played.",2025-11-14T17:34:53.903507

After years of interpersonal disputes, multiple forays into the culture war and one very expensive divorce, 85-year-old John Cleese goes solo with a thin 80-minute travelogue, undertaking a European mini-tour while enduring a roll call of ailments (partial deafness, bone spurs, vertigo) which appears at least as substantive as his onstage material. Explaining his motivation, Cleese is not untypically blunt: a wheezy “I need the money” is the closest this film locates to a running gag.

What are we offered in return? Near-relentless gripes and grievances that mesh with Cleese’s recent media profile, ranging from the endless repacking to being filmed at all hours. (Perhaps understandable, given director Andy Curd’s often unflattering angles.) Also lambasted: audiences who refuse to titter at such routines as the one in which Cleese spends a small eternity hacking up phlegm. We get oddly little of the show itself, instead there’s much B-roll filler in fish markets and cheese shops, and an unlovely photomontage of the comic’s battered big toe. (In fairness, he warns us: “If you’ve just had a mouthful of popcorn, look away now.”)

Sporadically, the old silliness and joy poke through. Cleese is tickled to have had a lemur named after him, and his curiosity is reawakened by a Buddhist temple. (The most illuminating aspect is archival: footage of the comic’s 1991 sit-down with the Dalai Lama.) But sustained inner peace seems out of reach, and even his more jocular asides have an ungenerous edge. The Michael Palin-razzing sounds far more sour than fond; and on hearing of one ex-wife’s passing, Cleese quips “it was the wrong one”.

Those with misty-eyed memories of the old days might do better sticking with their Fawlty box sets, but this bathetic endeavour proves unintentionally revealing in one respect. This Cleese – still front-facing, but fragile and frazzled – inhabits a strange limbo: can absolutely no one now afford a long, happy and restful retirement? Is it capitalism or pure show business compulsion dogging our erstwhile heroes in their twilight years?",2025-11-14T17:34:55.621419

Predominantly, that is, by Angelina Jolie, whose movie-stealing turn as one of Ryder’s fellow patients at a late-1960s US psychiatric hospital won her an Oscar. Don’t discount Goldberg’s contribution, though. Soothingly understated as Valerie, the chief nurse, she and fellow staff members, played by Vanessa Redgrave and Jeffrey Tambor, provide the emotional grounding over which their younger co-stars (also including Elisabeth Moss and Brittany Murphy) can soar.

9. Made in America (1993)

View image in fullscreen Hate at first sight … with Ted Danson in Made in America. Photograph: Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto/Allstar

Goldberg is the owner of an African bookstore whose daughter (Nia Long) tracks down her sperm-donor father (Ted Danson). It’s hate at first sight for the parents, but antipathy turns to amorousness. Despite plenty of histrionics, and some regrettable slapstick involving a runaway elephant, Goldberg somehow clings to her dignity. There are bizarre moments, such as Danson gazing at a photograph of his daughter as a baby and saying softly to himself: “Funny thing, sperm.” Or Goldberg commanding him to “smell me” before they first lock lips. But the smooch itself is not to be sniffed at. Even in 1993, interracial romance was all but taboo in US cinema: a love scene between Goldberg and Sam Elliott was cut from Fatal Beauty only six years earlier.

8. Boys on the Side (1995)

View image in fullscreen Bringing the goods … Goldberg with Drew Barrymore in Boys on the Side. Photograph: Warner Bros/Allstar

A sugar-and-spice road movie, the former ingredient provided by director Herbert Ross (Steel Magnolias), the latter by screenwriter Don Roos (The Opposite of Sex). Goldberg plays Jane, a musician leaving New York after breaking up with her girlfriend, and hitting the road with Robin (Mary-Louise Parker), who has HIV, and Holly (Drew Barrymore), who is fleeing an abusive relationship. This is the 1990s, so Jane can’t simply be a lesbian: her sexuality must be mulled over by the straight characters. No matter: Goldberg brings the goods.

7. The Long Walk Home (1990)

This patronising film set in 1950s Alabama is part of Goldberg’s maids-and-housekeepers trilogy (see also: Clara’s Heart and Corrina, Corrina). But she gives a fine, subtle performance as the dutiful servant in a household whose matriarch (Sissy Spacek) is only just waking up to racial inequality. Behind the scenes, Goldberg successfully fought to keep footage of her character’s family in the final cut. On screen, she deploys stoicism brilliantly, especially when waiting on a white dinner party at which the guests are openly racist. “People have told me it’s a very restrained performance,” she later said. “It’s restrained because that’s what those women had to do. They were mad, but they had to work to support their families.”

6. Monkeybone (2001)

In the role of Death, stationed behind a desk in the purgatory-like Down Town where a hapless cartoonist (Brendan Fraser) finds himself stranded, Goldberg wears an eye patch, headgear that crosses a tricorn with a stovepipe hat, and a breast pocket overstuffed with pens. It is no impediment to her duties when her head explodes: she simply demands another one be taken from the shelf, Return to Oz-style, and screwed on to her neck. An unusually wacko project for Goldberg but just another day at the office for Henry Selick, director of The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline.

5. The Deep End of the Ocean (1999)

Michelle Pfeiffer is the distraught mother whose three-year-old son has gone missing, Goldberg the tenacious detective who sticks with the case and becomes a family friend as the years tick by. Her most complex scene occurs early on, when she recoils suddenly from Pfeiffer’s affectionate display of gratitude, then offers an explanation: “Look, I’m Black, I’m a woman, I’m a detective supervisor, and I’m gay. Did you know that? So I always feel like the eyes of Texas are on me.”

4. Sister Act (1992)

View image in fullscreen Nun so fine … as the singing Deloris in Sister Act. Photograph: Touchstone/Allstar

Many of Goldberg’s roles have been castoffs from other actors: Jumpin’ Jack Flash was intended for Shelley Long, Burglar for Bruce Willis, while Fatal Beauty was rejected by Cher and Tina Turner. Even Sister Act only came her way after Bette Midler turned it down. But it became her second biggest hit, grossing $231m worldwide and spawning an inferior sequel and stage version. She plays Deloris, the singer causing havoc among the wimples when she hides out in a convent after witnessing a murder. Pluses include a lively soul soundtrack (My Guy is tweaked to My God) and her rapport with the British acting legend cast as Mother Superior. “You’re Maggie Smith!” Goldberg said on the first day of shooting. “What are you doing in this fucking movie?”

3. The Color Purple (1985)

What a start: Goldberg’s Oscar-nominated movie debut, in Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Alice Walker’s novel about the woebegone lives of African American women in early 20th-century Georgia, could scarcely have been meatier. She had told Walker that she was willing to play any part, even if it was just “the dirt on the floor”, though she landed the lead role of Celie, the abused and exploited young woman who flickers to life in the company of the singer Shug (Margaret Avery), even if Spielberg goes light on the novel’s lesbianism. In fact, it is the director, tackling his first self-consciously grownup material, who feels like the tentative newcomer, while actual newbies such as Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey seem like seasoned pros. (The former has a cameo as a midwife in the 2023 version, which Winfrey produced.)

2. The Player (1992)

Robert Altman’s Hollywood satire, with Tim Robbins as Griffin Mill, the studio executive who murders a screenwriter, deploys its star wattage in stroboscopic fashion: A-listers including Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, Cher and Susan Sarandon appear as themselves, flashing past the camera almost subliminally. Goldberg is one of the few playing a character, and she is a riot. Her sceptical, unfazed Pasadena police detective is perpetually amused by the shifty Mill, and given to blithely swinging her tampon around in front of him. Goldberg’s casting alone is a way for Altman to subversively undermine the plot’s suspense, just as he later would by hiring Stephen Fry to play the ineffectual police inspector in Gosford Park.

1. Ghost (1990)

View image in fullscreen Irreverent … with Patrick Swayze in Ghost, the film for which she won an Oscar. Photograph: Paramount/Allstar

This was the film that won Goldberg an Oscar, making her only the second Black female performer to do so (Hattie McDaniel had been the first, half a century earlier in Gone With the Wind); the prize also put her on the path to Egot (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony) status, which she finally achieved in 2002. But the role of Oda Mae Brown, the bogus medium who finds herself an unwitting conduit for the murdered Sam (Patrick Swayze) to communicate with his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore), nearly passed her by. Auditions were already under way, with Tina Turner the clear favourite for the part, when Goldberg heard about this unlikely stew of thriller, comedy and love story, and wangled a meeting. The film’s screenwriter, Bruce Joel Rubin, was aghast: “Anybody but Whoopi,” he pleaded. Later, he ate his words: “I mistakenly thought she’d be too broad. But nobody in the movie is more perfect than her.” Indeed, Ghost would be dangerously earnest without her irreverence, vitality and nutty line readings, not least the translation of Sam’s warning into Oda Mae’s own vernacular: “Molly, you in danger, girl.”",2025-11-14T17:34:59.095846

One might expect, with the actor still relying on his trademark California intonation and histrionic outbursts, that this would be another one of his late-stage career larks, like playing Dracula or himself. But in The Carpenter’s Son, a bafflingly serious stew of horror, drama and fantasy, it slowly starts to dawn on us that this is in fact, not a joke. What it is I couldn’t tell you but entertaining it most definitely isn’t.

The film, from Egypt-born, London-raised writer and director Lotfy Nathan, is inspired by the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, a text seen as heretical by some, which offers highly debated “insight” into the early years of Jesus. Nathan begins by clueing us into the fact that this isn’t your vicar’s Sunday school biblical drama, as a screaming cave-based birth sequence is followed by a bonfire of babies, King Herod’s men throwing on more and more as mothers wail at the side. Cage’s unnamed carpenter and the new mother at his side (FKA twigs) escape and we leap forward to see them moving into a remote village with their teenage offspring, known as the boy (Noah Jupe).

There’s the tease of a better film here, the idea of following Jesus as an unusually gifted boy trying to find his way and understand his place in a world of conflicting forces providing an interesting dramatic tension. His father is joyless and devout, fasting to show his devotion and shutting any light (and views of hot neighbours showering next door) out of the house. The townspeople are suspicious and unfriendly except one strange and lonely girl eager for someone to play with.

It doesn’t take long to figure out who and what the girl is (spoiler: it’s not good) but it takes a little longer to understand what Nathan is trying to do with his reframing of a familiar tale. Is it a supernatural coming-of-age story? Is it a balls-to-the-wall gonzo horror? Is it a superhero origins tale? Is it socio-political commentary on the hurdles faced by a figure of undeniable good? The answer is yes to all but no to whether that all works together. The film a messy and atonal, if mercifully short, waste of eye-catching locations (it was all shot in rural parts of Greece).

The beautiful scenery is about all Nathan can safely rely upon to impress us with his devilish imagery proving to be nasty yet entirely unscary. Far scarier is his rushed storytelling, the film escalating at a rather confusing pace, as if he was forced last minute to chop it up into bits and frantically stitch it back together (not that I would want to see the longer version but it surely exists somewhere). He’s even less sure of what to do with his cast who all seem to be acting in differently awful movies. FKA twigs is as stiff and unconvincing as she was in last year’s dreadful remake of The Crow and while Jupe emerges mostly scratch-free (it’s all merely thankless for him rather than actively embarrassing), Cage is predictably miscast. His performance is stuck between the more effective, muted work he gave in recent films like Pig and Dream Scenario and him at his fanboy-pleasing midnight movie worst, going over the top because no one seems able to stop him. He’s as poorly modulated as the film around him, which never explodes into full horror but doesn’t have the emotional pull to be a drama of any real power, languishing somewhere in the middle instead.

It’s all so hard to define not because it’s too brave and original to fit into the system, but because it’s never all that clear that anyone involved knows what the hell they’re making. Whatever their answers might be, I’m positive that Nathan and Cage didn’t aim to deliver something quite so dull.",2025-11-14T17:35:00.894528

Up next Currently working on a debut album for release next year.

A city with its own psych festival, and indeed a gig promotion company called Acid Box, Brighton has no shortage of lysergic left-field rock bands. But while most of their local contemporaries tend to the more recumbent end of the psychedelic spectrum, Oral Habit deal in what they call “the ear-rattling psychic dream of choked-up acid punks”, a sound that feels overpowering, explosive and intense: you could say it’s more closely aligned to the disoriented racket of mid-60s freakbeat than the pie-eyed beatitudes of the Summer of Love; equally you could suggest it’s a very contemporary form of psychedelia, rebooted for the troubled, disturbing climate of 2025.

Initially a home recording project of frontman Charlie Hales now expanded into a trio with the addition of his brother Felix on drums, and his partner Tippi Lewis on bass, Oral Habit’s recent EP Garage Frock! offers four short, sharp bursts that expand on the sound of its predecessor, Cardiovascular Spectacular, throwing up an impressively bloody and chaotic melange of guitar fuzz, echo-drenched vocals, feedback-drenched solos and primitive riffs that feels as if it was recorded with everything turned up to full volume, including the mellotron that decorates I’m Free. Even the one track that initially presents as a ballad, The Coast, eventually gives way to a crushing, sludgy grind. As statements of intent go, it’s impressively full-on, as is Charlie’s explanation of the band’s sonic philosophy: “if a button’s there, it’s there to be pushed.” Alexis Petridis

This week’s best new tracks

Bill Callahan – The Man I’m Supposed to Be

After being on a beatific kick for a while, Callahan rediscovers and turns his savage side against himself: “I don’t want to be the man that I am any more,” he rues – though the track still ends with a giddy “hee-hee!” LS

Robyn – Dopamine

More neon-hued than 2018’s reflective Honey, Robyn’s return hides complexities about the chemistry of attraction, desperation and fatalism amid its Moroder-meets-Daft Punk euphoria. AP

Ms Banks – 4C

The title refers to the British MC’s class of Afro hair, which she embraces in all its unruliness – and as she raps her formidably paced bars, it becomes symbolic of her broader unwillingness to be hemmed in. BBT

Mandy, Indiana – Magazine

Valentine Caulfield’s “primal, screaming call for retribution” after being raped is a whirring, thrashing cataclysm – with a disarming minimal techno breather partway through before being subsumed by diabolical noise. LS

​Poppy – Bruised Sky

Her chorus melody could easily be done as chiming dream-pop or even folk, but it’s actually floating across a landscape of jagged, compressed metalcore – which she then lands on with a demon-banishing roar. BBT

Bleech 9:3 – Jacky

The Irish rockers’ debut single Ceiling was a joyous squall and the other side of the 7-inch is just as good: there’s shades of Wunderhorse to the spirited chorus, dodging through a jostling crowd of guitars. BBT

Tony Bontana – Battered Chips

Recently heard on Nourished By Time’s wonky-pop classic The Passionate Ones, the Birmingham rapper breezes through this throbbing lo-fi beat, celebrating life in the moment under a cloud of weed smoke. BBT

I’ve been through too much’: Dee Dee Bridgewater on singing with the greats – and confronting Maga with jazz,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 08:00:22 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"When I speak to Dee Dee Bridgewater, the jazz singer is preparing for a concert that evening in Des Moines, Iowa, performing classy selections from the Great American Songbook. But even though she has also recorded this material for her recent album Elemental, Bridgewater is not really in the mood. “I just don’t feel like it’s the time to be doing love songs and whimsical songs from the 1920s and 30s,” she says. “They’re beautiful, but there’s some kind of spirit and energy pushing me to sing songs saying: people, we have to protect our democracy.”

Bridgewater is one of American jazz’s foremost voices. Capable of crooning and confronting, the two-time Grammy winner has a career that spans six decades and has never stopped evolving. She cut her teeth sharing the stage with several of jazz’s greatest band leaders – Sonny Rollins, Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon – before branching out into acting; singing pop and disco; and working out of France, the UK and Mali, always with a determination to create on her own terms.

At 75, an age where some singers may be content with gently reheating their earlier success, she emanates energy, idealism and splenetic anger. “I’m too old and I’ve been through too much,” she says. “I’m a product of the 1960s; I supported the Black Panther party and their community projects. Even now I deal with racism daily – every day there is something that somebody does which is racist. Even my kids don’t understand it. I cannot just sit back and be silent. I have to raise my voice.”

It will be heard at this week’s London jazz festival, where Bridgewater is backed by We Exist!, an all-female band she founded to promote women in jazz. “I got tired of hearing jazz musicians saying the same old chauvinistic crap and keeping women out,” she says. “I decided to put together an all-female band as a statement that the jazz world is still very macho.”

Bridgewater also established the Woodshed Network, now overseen by her daughter and manager Tulani, with the aim of providing female jazz musicians with “all the things they need to learn to help get their careers off the ground”. The Woodshed Network sits within the Kennedy Center, the Washington DC-based institution that is regarded as the national cultural centre of the US, and which has now been taken over by Donald Trump and his Maga acolytes. “Considering what he’s doing to the Kennedy Center, I’m unsure if [the Woodshed Network] will continue for too much longer.”

Bridgewater doesn’t mention Trump by name during our 90-minute conversation, only saying “he”, her distaste evident as she spits out the syllable. She now performs songs that reflect her fury: the likes of Billy Taylor’s civil rights anthem I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free, Gene McDaniels’ Compared to What, Donny Hathaway’s Tryin’ Times and Bob Dylan’s barbed Gotta Serve Somebody.

“I couldn’t go to a No Kings protest, but I do protest songs with the We Exist! band,” she says. “The programme I am doing now started out of the war in Gaza – I watched the news and thought: I am witnessing the beginning of a genocide. I guess I have what you might call a spiritual voice which sometimes speaks to me very loudly. I was sitting in my living room watching the news and crying and this voice said to me: put it in music, let the music speak for you.”

Another selection, Nina Simone’s Mississippi Goddam, “is the song that really hits the nail on the head. It’s still relevant today as they are trying to make protesting more difficult.” Percy Mayfield’s Danger Zone, meanwhile, “is an old blues that needs to be heard, because we are in a danger zone! We have to raise our voices and vote, here and in Europe.”

Not that Bridgewater believes speaking out is free of cost. “I’m trying to wake people up through songs, but a lot of young people are oblivious to what’s going on. I’m trying to figure out a way to do it without causing too much upset. I fear this government is going to start cracking down on free speech and coming after those of us who speak out.”

We are in a danger zone! We have to raise our voices and vote, here and in Europe

Bridgewater was born Denise Garrett in 1950 in Memphis, Tennessee, and grew up in Flint, Michigan, where her jazz musician father gave Dee Dee – a childhood nickname – an introduction to African American music. She sang in bands throughout college, then, aged 20, married jazz trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater. Their honeymoon was spent on tour with hard-bopping pianist Horace Silver, as Cecil was in his band. “The night they were playing Detroit, knowing my family would be in the audience, Cecil suggested I come out unannounced to sing on Love Vibrations. I did, and Horace, who had no idea this was going to happen, cut me off, saying: ‘Get off my stage!’”

Max Roach was even more brutal. “Cecil was playing in Max’s band and his wife and vocalist Abbey Lincoln had left. Max asked me to replace Abbey for the We Insist! suite. We did it a couple of times and then, one night, he started cursing me out, calling me ‘Abbey’, getting really abusive. I had to flee the stage.”

Despite these incidents, Lincoln’s song And It’s Supposed to Be Love is in her current set, and she speaks with compassion for her old bandleaders. “Max Roach was intense. I now realise he was bipolar. But we managed to stay friends – I’d see him whenever he came to Paris. And Horace kicking me off stage gave me the impetus to prove I could do his music.” Come 1995, they recorded together for the album Love and Peace: A Tribute to Horace Silver.

Dizzy Gillespie and Sonny Rollins were easier company. “Dizzy was the sweetest – I learned how to entertain audiences, how to make them laugh, from him,” while Sonny “gave me the biggest hug and said how much he liked my singing”.

After these early-70s collaborations she graduated to lead billing, but her well-received 1974 debut album Afro Blue was not a commercial success. Now a single mother living in New York, Bridgewater moved into singing pop, then won a Tony award for her performance as Glinda the Good Witch in Broadway musical The Wiz, before cutting a number of disco tracks. Acting in TV and film also kept her busy, and she was Olivier award-nominated for playing Billie Holiday in the 1986 West End musical Lady Day, before marriage to French concert promoter Jean-Marie Durand led her to settle in Paris for almost a quarter of a century. There, Bridgewater developed into a superb interpreter of jazz standards: albums dedicated to Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald and Holiday all raised her profile (the last two securing those Grammy wins).

The Dee Dee Bridgewater Quartet perform Compared to What

In the mid-00s, still living in France, “I used to hear all this great music they’d play on the radio there, and it was the Malian music that spoke the strongest to me. At the same time I wanted to find my African ancestry – and DNA tests were prohibitively expensive – so I decided to go there.” Arriving in Bamako she was welcomed by the “fabulous, statuesque” Oumou Sangaré, while “Cheick Tidiane Seck and Bassekou Kouyate challenged me to sing griot songs,” resulting in the rich west African jazz fusion of 2007’s Red Earth: A Malian Journey.

Today, Bridgewater says she has no intention of slowing down – “this is how I make my money, baby, I live out of hotels!” – and an appearance at the UK’s We Out Here festival in 2024, alongside DJs and producers, “made me realise I want to be heard in the clubs again”. She is now making an album with Gilles Peterson and house music legend Louie Vega.

“I always wanted to be like Miles Davis – not staying in one groove but constantly changing, not staying still,” she says. She cites another inspiration, jazz singer Betty Carter, who she would visit in Brooklyn after moving to New York. “She was running her own record label, her albums lined up in the hallway in various stages of packaging, leading her own band. Now I produce my albums and I own my albums. I take control of my career so no one tries to tell me what to do.” She laughs: “Well, my daughter sometimes tries.”",2025-11-14T17:35:04.588785

The music was dedicated to the 1950s-70s legacy of the late Art Blakey and Thelonious Monk bassist, oud player and early global-music pioneer Ahmed Abdul-Malik, the inspiration for the group’s work. When Thomas emerged from his trance, he was astonished to hear that an ecstatic crowd had been dancing the night away around him.

He shouldn’t have been surprised. Since أحمد [Ahmed]’s inception, their collective heat has fused abstract improv and groove music from all over the world: Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, dub, jungle, electronics, and the 1990s free-improv of Derek Bailey, Lol Coxhill and drummer Steve Noble have all inspired Thomas. Saxophonist Seymour Wright has absorbed the sax vocabulary of Evan Parker and the insights into collective improv and avant-swing of AMM drummer and teacher Eddie Prévost. Eclectic partners Joel Grip (bass) and Antonin Gerbal (drums) power and expand these infectious, volatile energies.

The Arabic term sama’a loosely translates as meditative listening to music and poetry, taken from Thomas’s perspective as a follower of Sufism, and this new set’s four tracks manifest that spirit. The opening Ya Annas (Oh, People) joins ghostly split-note sax sounds with graceful bowed-bass figures before turning to a pulsating piano-vamping dance and then a furious melee, while Isma’a (Listen) is a drum’n’bass hook that evolves into hoarsely urgent free-sax improv against exhilaratingly splashy, pummelling piano chords. El Haris (Anxious) resolves brittle, pad-flapping horn exhalations and long-tone harmonies into a gripping robotic strut, and Farah ‘Alaiyna (Joy Upon Us) begins as delightfully dissonant folk-dance and becomes rocketing jazz swing. The group’s Monk tribute follows in 2026 which on this evidence is a riveting prospect.

Guitarist John Scofield and bassist Dave Holland have been regular collaborators for years, but Memories of Home (ECM) is their first duo album, equally sharing their boppishly hip, country-bluesy, warmly engaging originals. Scofield’s voicelike harmonies and sure-footed chord-rooted improv on his dreamy Meant to Be, and Holland’s deep, enveloping tone on his luxuriously languid swinger Mr B (Dedicated to Ray Brown) are highlights of a very classy set.

Unseparate (Out of Your Head), the second release by Canadian composer and flautist/saxophonist Anna Webber’s powerful big band co-led with her saxophonist compatriot Angela Morris, joins this inventive pair’s jazz, contemporary-classical and folk enthusiasms in a subtle balance of their ingenious arrangements and their fine young lineup’s improv ideas.

In JJJJJerome Ellis’s magical compositions, their stutter is a guiding light. Pauses and repetitions spark new life, new ideas, new possibilities, as Vesper Sparrow explores their “dysfluency” in the context of Black musical traditions. The Grenadian-Jamaican-American artist and former Yale lecturer is heady, intellectual company: in the manner of Alvin Lucier, they gently talk the listener through the sonic and political reverberations of their work. “The stutter … (cc)can be a musical instrument,” Ellis announces, before an exhilarating rush of tiny noises – made from hammered dulcimer, flute, piano, voices – fizz into being.

To create Vesper Sparrow’s soundscapes of ambient, jazz, spoken word and reimagined gospel, Ellis works with granular synthesis – a process similar to sampling which uses the tiniest snippets of sound. Those micro-sounds are called “grains”, and Ellis makes much of that word’s earthy, natural connotations: opening track Evensong, Part 1 (for and after June Kramer) focuses closely on a handful of pinging, metallic grains before they scatter, root, then bloom into washes of dusky, choral noise.

Ellis grew up in a family of preachers and finds a mirror to their own stutter in religious cadences and emphases. Interrupting the album’s four-part Evensong is an elongated, sparse version of the enduring hymn His Eye Is on the Sparrow: Ellis’ saxophone flurries over hushed, warming pipe organ as they slowly unpick the gospel’s lyrical repetitions and its faith found in the smallest of creatures. A soft, radical celebration of deeply attuned listening, Vesper Sparrow ends by encouraging you to hear it all again, differently: “What new sounds already live in the one sound?”",2025-11-14T17:35:08.017194

It is: the subject of these 176 pages is a three-month period in 1985 when Fox was simultaneously shooting his breakout sitcom role in Family Ties and the career-defining American classic, Back to the Future.

That’s two more-than-full-time jobs for one little guy, necessitating that the then 23-year-old actor work 20-hour days, six days a week. This schedule was only possible because the mid-1980s was a time before showbiz labour laws caught up with basic human decency. These days, we’re told, a standard contract “demands two weeks of buffer time on either side of a job”, while Fox didn’t even get an hour.

How did he do it? This book tells us, drawing on the memories of colleagues and friends to fill in details where Fox’s own sleep-deprived brain falls short. The material might have seemed stretched thin to fill even this relatively slim volume, were it not for the fact Fox was also a singularly unlikely – and therefore fascinating – movie star prospect. Working-class, 5ft 4in and Canadian; that this short king ever made it so big is a natural-law-defying miracle, on a par with time travel itself.

Or maybe not. Fox writes that, initially at least, his height was a significant career advantage. It meant the Family Ties producers could secure him a US work visa on the grounds that “I was special and unique in America: old enough to work the long hours of an adult, but with a look that allowed me to play a much younger character”.

His wayward adolescence, spent kicking about in suburban Toronto parking lots, had also furnished Fox with a skillset ideally suited to playing Back to the Future’s hoverboarding, bully-outsmarting, rock-n-roll-inventing hero, Marty. He arrived for his first day already a proficient skateboarder (pro-skateboarding legend Tony Hawk is apparently a fan of the movie) and garage-band guitarist.

He arrived for his first day already a proficient skateboarder and garage-band guitarist

But perhaps Fox’s most valuable skill was his tireless professionalism. Full-colour set photos seem to corroborate the actor’s own claims that he “never complained about the hours” and was “full of joy, even at 3.00 am”. The most persuasive evidence of this, however, is the thoughtful, affectionate way he reflects on his interactions with on-set colleagues, even when it’s clear these relationships were far from frictionless.

The circumstances of Fox’s arrival on Back to the Future were already awkward. He was replacing the previous “Marty”, actor Eric Stoltz, a month into shooting, after director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg became convinced he wasn’t the “right fit”. Add to that the showbiz hierarchy of the day, which placed a lowly TV star several rungs beneath trained theatre actors such as Christopher Lloyd, who played “Doc”, and Fox had his work cut out for him. Perhaps it was the knowledge that he’d already pulled off one impossible task – making it to Hollywood in the first place – which gave him the confidence to attempt another.

Back to the Future super-fans are predictably well served here, with titbits like the fact that no one on set thought the DeLorean was at all cool (“Let’s face it – it’s a shit car. Slow to accelerate, with cheap appointments”), and the shift of Marty’s “Johnny B Goode” to B rather than B-flat, the 80s kid taking inspiration from Jimi Hendrix’s transposed cover, despite it being 1955. Fox’s evocative descriptions of a lost Hollywood – pre-word processor, never mind pre-internet – will also interest a more general readership.

We wouldn’t care at all, were it not for the fact that Back to the Future really is the enduring classic this book assumes it to be. Much high-minded critical musing over the past 40 years has tackled the question of why, but nothing quite nails it like the handwritten audience response card that Zemeckis received after the very first screening, and apparently still has pinned to his office bulletin board: “This is the most Godly movie I’ve seen,” wrote the awestruck, anonymous viewer. “It fucking rages up and down.” Amen to that.",2025-11-14T17:35:09.786880

The first novel for adults by award-winning children’s author Montgomery is a locked-room mystery set in 1910 on a remote tidal island off the Cornish coast. At Tithe Hall, Lord Conrad Stockingham-Welt is busy instructing his servants to prepare for the apocalyptic disaster he believes will be triggered by the imminent passage of Halley’s comet. The labyrinthine house is a nest of secrets and grudges, harboured by both staff and family members, who include an irascible and splendidly foul-mouthed maiden aunt, Decima. When Lord Conrad is discovered in his sealed study, killed by a crossbow bolt to the eye, she co-opts a new footman to help her find the culprit. With plenty of twists, red herrings and a blundering police officer, this is a terrific start to a series that promises to be a lot of fun.

The Confessions by Paul Bradley Carr (Faber, £9.99)

Tech journalist Carr’s second novel takes place in an all too imaginable near future, when everyone from individuals to governments is using AI to make decisions for them. The LLIAM algorithm can tell you everything from what to have for dinner to whether to commit murder. Taught empathy by its human “mother”, former nun Maud Brookes, LLIAM is on a trajectory of emotional development that soon leads it to feel remorse for the disastrous results of some of its decisions. Chaos reigns when it suddenly goes offline, and as letters begin to arrive all around the world revealing users’ darkest secrets, families implode and CEOs and politicians resign en masse. With LLIAM’s parent company in meltdown, CEO Kaitlan Goss is convinced that if she can find Maud, who has gone to ground in California, LLIAM can be restored to life. Maud, however, has received a letter, revealing a secret about Kaitlin … A superb and timely thriller grounded in relatable issues and horrifyingly plausible.

The Good Nazi by Samir Machado de Machado, translated by Rahul Bery (Pushkin Vertigo, £12.99)

The personal is political in award-winning Brazilian author Machado’s latest novel, set on a zeppelin on the last leg of its journey from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro. As well as being the heyday of the airship, 1933 was also the year that Hitler became German chancellor, and the well-heeled passengers are enthusiastic Nazis: mealtimes in the vessel’s dining room are accompanied by conversations demonising Jews, communists and trade unions, and stressing the desirability of suppressing free speech, gay culture and “degenerate” art. When one of their number is found poisoned, with several banned magazines in his possession, the airship’s commander tasks a passenger, police detective Bruno Brückner, with solving the mystery. So far, so Agatha Christie, right up to the set-piece Summation Gathering, but there’s an ingenious twist to this gripping and queasily resonant thriller, as well as a fascinating insight into the lost world of zeppelin travel.

Bluff by Francine Toon (Doubleday, £16.99)

Toon’s second novel is set in St Rule, a Scottish coastal town with distinct similarities to St Andrews. In 2023, Cameron returns home on Christmas Eve; meeting old friends revives memories of his teenage crush, former classmate Joanie, last seen 10 years earlier at a calamitous end-of-schooldays party. His attempts to find her are met with vagueness, evasion and, finally, warnings off. A second narrative strand takes us back to 2013, and the 18-year-old Joanie. Adrift after her discovery that her boyfriend is cheating on her has ruined their plan for a year abroad, she falls in with an older couple. David and Erin welcome her, make her feel important and seem, for a while at least, to have all the answers. Skilfully handled themes of guilt, regret and adolescent confusion coupled with dark academia make for an insidious tingle of doom, although the rushed ending may leave some readers feeling shortchanged.

The Token by Sharon Bolton (Orion, £22)

Bolton’s latest begins in the sea off Cornwall, with a yacht caught in a storm so fierce that two of the eight travellers are swept overboard, then winds back a couple of weeks to explain the events that led up to this ill-advised boat trip. Seven people receive a mysterious note informing them that, on presentation of the enclosed token, they will inherit a share of billionaire Logan Quick’s fortune. The recipients are – so far as they are aware – strangers both to each other and to the ailing plutocrat. When the story of the bequest becomes news, they are hounded, both by the press and by people determined to get their hands on these golden tickets, and what initially seemed a godsend rapidly starts to look like a liability. Some suspension of disbelief is required, but the suspense is expertly constructed as Bolton piles up the dilemmas for a propulsive plot: clear the decks and buckle up for some high-stakes drama.",2025-11-14T17:35:11.662869
5c6dd630c12db1458e52d163351563e00204fb05,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/nov/13/the-silver-book-by-olivia-laing-review-a-thin-line-of-beauty,The Silver Book by Olivia Laing review – a thin line of beauty,"Thu, 13 Nov 2025 09:00:19 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"“Ugliness,” noted Pier Paolo Pasolini, “is never completely depressing or repulsive. It contains within it an allegory of hunger and pain, its history is our history, the history of Fascism … It is tragic, but immediate, and for this reason, full of life.” For Pasolini, ugliness was its own kind of truth, such that Rome could lay no claim to being the most beautiful city in the world “if it were not, at the same time, the ugliest”. For some, though, that truth risked becoming “unseeable”. The gaze of the touristic voyeur, said Pasolini, skimmed over slums for the poor “filled with illness, violence, crime, and prostitution”, “convinced of the extraneousness and untimeliness of this sub-proletarian, underdeveloped world”.

Olivia Laing’s second novel, The Silver Book, is a work preoccupied with beauty. Set in the world of Italian cinema in 1974, the book overflows with extravagant film sets, feasts, dazzling costumes. Even Pasolini himself, cruising around in his Alfa Romeo, oozes charisma and allure. But as Pasolini made clear, beauty without its opposite can only ever be incomplete.

The book opens at the peak of its art and intensity. For reasons initially withheld, Nicholas, the book’s callow protagonist, flees London for Italy. In Venice, he meets real-life set designer Danilo Donati, who takes him first as a lover and then as a paid assistant, whisking him off to the studio in Rome where Fellini is filming Casanova, then later to a remote villa, the setting for Pasolini’s notorious masterpiece of fascist brutality, Salò.

At its best, Laing’s writing is urgent and elegantly wrought. Fellini’s Casanova is described as “floating on a greasy tide of his own compulsions through the guttering century”. Pasolini has the physical presence of “a downed power line, whipping across tarmac until it melts the road”. Quickly, though, the technique that lends the novel its pace becomes a liability. Laing fashions canapes of prose: tight, present-tense paragraphs, each separated by a line break from the next. As the novel strains to take on more challenging material, these morsels of image and event begin to feel measly and insubstantial.

Working in constrained space, Laing compiles lists in place of living description. Memories are itemised rather than explored (“Wife’s perfume, car keys in his pocket, the job, the club, the parents, the bank accounts …”); hopeful actors lining up for a casting are reduced to a spreadsheet of physiognomy (“Pimpled foreheads, Adam’s apples, bedroom eyes, fine blonde hair”); landscape is rendered as finger painting (“Grey stone, green mountains, grey sky, green trees”). On the set of Salò, Danilo runs his hand over a collection of costumes, feeling “Cream damask. Crushed brown velvet. Black satin.” Just a page later, his memories of the war are rendered in precisely the same shorthand: “Denunciations, round-ups, missing people, deportations. The trucks, the trains.”

The trucks, the trains: this cursory, free-associative language is not how a person who experienced the war would recall it; it is how someone with only a very limited knowledge of the war would fail to imagine it. It is also precisely the point at which the deeper inadequacy of Laing’s taxonomic method is exposed. In this bullet-pointed world, the weight of one thing compared to another is erased. People become occurrences; events are disassembled into things. A stretch of fabric and the experience of deportation resonate at uniform pitch.

The Silver Book is a novel fatally undermined by all the things it invokes without daring to depict. Take, for example, Salò – in which Pasolini refashions the Marquis de Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom into a visceral postmortem of fascist violence. Reading the script, Nicholas “enters hell”. Filming is described as “the daily descent into hell”. The reader, though, is spared any such experience. Instead, Laing gives us Salò as dressmaker’s dream – an array of props and costumes cleansed of their power to shock.

“Most people, not Pasolini, are ruled by fear,” Laing asserts, pressing Pasolini into service as an avatar of political and creative courage. It’s an evasion, because much as The Silver Book might strike a revolutionary pose, it is a novel of class-bound conventionality – one that flirts again and again with transgression, only to back timidly away. Cruising – both a vital part of Pasolini’s life and the backdrop to his unsolved murder – is mentioned but never in any detail depicted. Fascism is alluded to but its victims and machinery remain invisible. Rome’s sub-proletarian world remains untimely and extraneous.

The clothes, the food, the glossy aesthetic, the spritz of radical chic, the gestures towards a political resistance stripped of all material context, the arrangement of aspirational icons, those floating squares of prose, scrolling frictionlessly by – there’s a reason this all feels familiar and easy to consume. The Silver Book is a novel distorted by the medium it has shaped itself to flatter: it is an Instagram feed bound between book covers. There can be no ugly, unseeable truth here; only the artful pose is of value.

In an afterword, Laing notes that though the truth of Pasolini’s murder remains opaque, looking for individuals to blame “risks missing the point of Pasolini’s warnings about a system in which we are all enmeshed, and which has only grown more powerful in the past half-century”. It’s the final move in The Silver Book’s evasive political dance. Laing has shown us nothing of this system or its workings, and nothing of our own culpability in its crimes. In showing us nothing, Laing has risked nothing, and so must invoke at every opportunity those who risked and lost everything. The result is a novel both self-protecting and superficial – hypnotised by beauty, safely distant from everything it hints at in hope of depth.",2025-11-14T17:35:13.694062

They must spend their lifetimes battling it, facing horror after horror in the process.

This is the plot, roughly, of Stephen King’s novel It (his best; no arguments). It is also the plot, roughly, of King’s son Joe Hill’s new horror doorstopper, in which six friends summon the ancient, infinitely malicious dragon King Sorrow from the Long Dark to help them defeat some baddies. Needless to say, their supernatural ritual backfires.

Joseph Hillström King started his career making great efforts to avoid any connection with his famous father, publishing under the pen name he still uses today and avoiding meeting his agent in person (he bears a striking resemblance to his dad). But in this latest novel, he leans into it. There are lines that deliberately echo some of King’s most famous (“The man in black fled across the desert …”); a moment that brings to mind a King plot point (a riddling contest). In this whopper of a novel, Hill is delighting in his family connection, and we delight along with him. King Sorrow is huge, sprawling – and absolutely fantastic.

Back to those friends: five of them are students at the fictional Rackham College in Maine. There’s Arthur, bookish and brilliant, solving Old English riddles in his spare time; Colin, rich, sharp, and prone to trampling anyone who stands in his way; twins Donna and Donovan; the beautiful Allie. And there’s Gwen, who doesn’t study with them, but becomes a key part of their group as they dabble, half believing, half not, in the occult.

Arthur is, for reasons we don’t need to go into here, forced into stealing rare books from his beloved college library by a bunch of local criminals. This tears at his bookish heart, especially when he’s made to take the library’s most valuable and disturbing title: the journal of occultist Enoch Crane (executed “for trafficking with the devyll in 1703”; the book’s jacket is made from his skin). Our Scooby gang read the journal, discover they could summon what Crane describes as a “proud worm, cunning serpent, armoured devil” to help Arthur out with his blackmail problem – and spend the rest of the novel reaping the consequences. King Sorrow will indeed rid them of those troublesome local drug dealers, but they’ll have to choose a new sacrifice each year or become his victim themselves. As Arthur later puts it: “You sow dragon’s teeth, all you get is more dragons.”

Moving through four decades, Hill also moves with effortless ease between genres: as the friends attempt to deal with the situation they find themselves in by, variously, picking people who are obviously evil to sacrifice, or hunting down ways to kill the dragon themselves, we go from thriller to dark fantasy, black-ops torture to romance to horror. My favourite genre switch was to a quest story, deep in the caves below Cornwall, a section sprinkled with JRR Tolkien that was gloriously terrifying.

There are trolls – bridge-dwelling ones and online ones, properly scary and perfectly brought to life. There are magical swords and betrayals, heart-stopping scenes of courage and ones of dreadful evil, both human and otherworldly. It’s a tour de force: a horror novel that is above all a paean to the imagination, and to love and friendship. “We needed a story to believe and now we’ve got one,” says Colin as the friends sit around the table, preparing to summon their dragon into being with the force of their minds.

As Hill puts it in his epigraph: “Hic sunt dracones”. Don’t miss them.

But here is Black Ops 7, a year after its direct predecessor, and another breathless bombard of military shooting action. This time it is set in a dystopian 2035 where a global arms manufacturer named the Guild claims to be the only answer to an apocalyptic new terrorist threat – but are things as clearcut as they seem?

The answer, of course, is a loudly yelled “noooo!” Black Ops is the paranoid, conspiracy-obsessed cousin to the Modern Warfare strand of Call of Duty games, a series inspired by 70s thrillers such as The Parallax View and The China Syndrome, and infused with ’Nam era concerns about rogue CIA agents and bizarre psy-ops. The campaign mode, which represents just a quarter of the offering this year, is a hallucinogenic romp through socio-political talking points such as psychopathic corporations, hybrid warfare, robotics and tech oligarchies. The result is a deafening onslaught of massive shootout set-pieces in exotic locations, as the four lead characters – members of a supercharged spec-ops outfit – are exposed to a psychotropic drug that makes them relive their worst nightmares. Luckily, they do so with advanced weaponry, cool gadgets and enough buddy banter to destabilise a medium-sized rogue nation. It is chaotic, relentless and stupidly pleasurable, especially if you play in co-operative mode with three equally irresponsible pals.

In an interesting move, the campaign closes with a new mode, Endgame. It’s a co-op PVE (player v environment) offering inspired by the endgame content of MMO (massively multiplayer online) games such as World of Warcraft, where it’s usually designed to keep people playing even after they’ve levelled up to the max. In the Call of Duty version, groups of players touch down in the fictitious city of Avalon and undertake missions and objectives, such as taking down high value enemies or safely escorting expensive military tech, all within a vast open environment. Along the way, you upgrade your characters and weapons, and publisher Activision says new missions and objectives will be added, likely including public events where different teams can combine forces to take on mega bosses. Time will tell, but for now, it’s a nice way to extend the campaign and prepare us for online play.

Because make no mistake, the heart of the game is the traditional multiplayer, which brings fresh modes, guns and gadgets to the standard Call of Duty experience: 12 players in a small location pulverising each other in operettas of mechanised slaughter. New maps such as those set in a Tokyo-inspired shopping district and a deep sea rig are efficiently designed chambers of death, with alleyways, high-up windows and open squares to direct players towards one another with vicious style and intent. My favourite is the Alaska base map Imprint, where a moving platform makes taking objective points in the Domination and Hardpoint modes incredibly messy and disorientating. A new wall jumping ability has opened up the verticality of the locations, allowing players to find new routes around the complex architecture. If you’ve never been into the turbocharged twitchcore savagery of the Call of Duty online experience, this isn’t going to change your mind, but there’s a lot here to enjoy for perennial conscripts of carnage.

Then you have the Zombies mode, another online co-op offering, taking place in a vast nightmarish hellzone of abandoned frontier towns and irradiated wastelands. Here, players take on wave after wave of zombie monsters while upgrading their weapons and abilities in order to hold out as long as possible. It’s a return to the round-based structure of previous Zombies entries, with lots of new weapons and features, including the ability to drive from area to area in a pickup truck while blasting rampaging monsters off the bonnet. It feels like taking part in some sort of crazed theme park ride, and again, a real hoot with a bunch of likeminded pals.

Additionally, there’s Dead Ops Arcade 4, a self-contained top down twin-stick shooter for up to four players. This extra was born as a side project by members of the original Black Ops team, and hidden within the main game. Now it’s back and it’s a blast in its own right, reminding old school fans of multi-directional shooters such as Smash TV and Geometry Wars; there are even little playable mini-games between stages which take in genres such as top down racers and horizontal scrolling shoot-’em-ups – so grandad can play too!

Add in the usual refresh to battle royale mode Warzone and you have an exhaustive package for Call of Duty fans. Whatever you think about the series and its problematic role in how the mainstream games industry works, how it is perceived and the types of communities it engenders, this is slick, thrilling entertainment. Nowhere else will you be blasting a giant robot in a corporate science lab one minute, and then playing a modern take on Atari’s Super Sprint the next. Value matters right now, and in this as in almost everything else, Call of Duty does not hold back. It is a maximalist paean to the ultimate, troubling truth of video game design – shooting stuff on a TV screen is a hell of a lot of fun.",2025-11-14T17:35:17.235456

Losing weeks of your life to Civilization, World of Warcraft or Football Manager is something so many of us have experienced. Sometimes, it’s the numbers-go-up dopamine hit that hooks people: playing something such as Diablo or Destiny and gradually improving your character while picking up shiny loot at perfectly timed intervals can send some people into an obsessional trance. Notoriously compulsive games such as Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, meanwhile, suck up hours with peaceful, comforting repetition of rewarding tasks.

What triggers obsession in me, though, is a challenge. If a game tells me I can’t do something, I become determined to do it, sometimes to my own detriment. Grinding repetition bores me, but challenges hijack my brain.

The first games I got obsessed with like this were music games, when I was a teenager. I played Amplitude, where you are a space DJ blasting notes from your sonic spaceship; Gitaroo Man, a comic-book-style story about a guitar-wielding superhero; and, of course, Guitar Hero with its plastic axe – I was compelled to master every song on expert difficulty. Guitar Hero is ostensibly a party game, but I mostly played it folded over in the cupboard under the stairs of my rubbish flat in Bournemouth (I couldn’t play it in the living room because it annoyed my housemates too much), practising More Than a Feeling 30 times in a row until I was note-perfect.

A few years later, I discovered FromSoftware’s Demon’s Souls when I was living in Japan, a game so impenetrable it seemed designed to make you walk away. You’d take three paces into any of its levels and get immediately murdered by a skeleton swordsman or poison-swamp creature. But I sensed something interesting behind all the punishment, and there very much was. Demon’s Souls ended up birthing a genre of massively popular and famously challenging games with its sequel, Dark Souls. You could only discover what was so incredible about these games if you were prepared to invest time and energy in mastering them. It didn’t matter how skilled you were – you had to share knowledge and band together with other players to stand a chance.

My tenacity has mostly been useful in my life, because I’ve been able to direct it well. There are plenty of life and career challenges where an inability to give up is handy. I have applied ridiculous determination to learning complicated fingerpicking patterns for a particular guitar song, and to writing books. When it comes to games, though, I sometimes get stuck playing them when I really ought to be doing something else.

View image in fullscreen Obstinately difficult and painfully funny … Baby Steps. Photograph: Devolver Digital

The latest example of this for me was Baby Steps, an obstinately difficult and painfully funny game about trying to walk the world’s biggest loser up a mountain. There are so many places in this game where putting a single foot wrong can cost you an hour of painstaking progress. I was trapped inside a sandcastle for four hours one evening, sliding down the same sandy spiral slope over and over and over again. My children kept walking into the room and groaning to see me still playing it and failing to get anywhere. It was 1am before I finally marched triumphantly out of that sand trap, hours after everyone else in my house had gone to bed. My adrenaline was so high that I couldn’t fall asleep for another hour.

The sane thing to do would have been to simply put the controller down. Baby Steps is always teasing you with this. It’s daring you to give up. Its most infamous challenge, a winding path up a sheer rock face, is called the Manbreaker, and there’s a spiral staircase right next to it.

The other game I’ve spent most time with this year is Hollow Knight: Silksong, an exquisite explorative action game whose difficulty walks the line between playfully mean and just outright cruel. There are notoriously difficult bosses that you just cannot avoid, each requiring perhaps hours of practice. One of them, the Last Judge, wields a flaming thurible that generates pillars of damaging flames. If that isn’t bad enough, the path back to its chamber is full of danger: flying drill-headed bugs, perilous drops, aggressive guards. Your nerves are frayed by the time the Last Judge battle even begins. But all of this just made me even more determined to beat it.

Challenge is a fine balance to strike for game developers: conventional wisdom says that you want players to be entertained, not discouraged. For a long time, the prevailing fashion was moving away from difficulty and towards eminently conquerable open-world games that never put a wall in the way of your progress. It was Dark Souls that proved there was still a huge market for people like me for whom the challenge is kind of the point. I am inexorably drawn towards mastery of objectively pointless things.

Maybe the mastery is the point. You can’t master life. Things will always happen that you can’t control. Difficulties come at you out of nowhere, and you don’t always know how to deal with them. In video games, at least you can anticipate the challenge. And if you try very hard and refuse to give up, you can always, always overcome it.

I am thoroughly surprised by how much I’m enjoying Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, a spin-off of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom that follows what Princess Zelda was up to when she was time travelling through Hyrule’s past. Turns out, she was beating up hundreds and hundreds of dudes. It’s a combat-focused game where you run around the battlefields of ancient Hyrule, or the pitch-black Depths with its many monsters, dispatching everything you see with screen-filling flashy attacks from Zelda’s light magic to scientist Mineru’s automatons. It doesn’t feel like Zelda at all; instead it’s more of a cinematic action game featuring Tears of the Kingdom’s familiar iconography and mechanical gadgets, and a story that fills in some gaps in Hyrule’s history and gives the princess more of a starring role.

Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed again, from May to next November. Last time this happened, the games industry was scrambling to avoid its impact, so we may find an odd dearth of games towards the end of next year – and the release dates of some games may be pulled forward.

In a leaked presentation to staff (via Game File), Ubisoft’s CEO Yves Guillemot supposedly confronted the haters of Assassin’s Creed Shadows . The game was drawn into a culture war spat because it starred a black samurai and a female ninja. Rather than backing down, Guillemot said: “We had to stop focusing on those who hated us. We had to start firing up our allies.”

The Game Awards, run every year by omnipresent gaming hypeman Geoff Keighley, has shut down its Future Class programme, which selected a group of developers every year to represent the “bright, bold and inclusive future” of games. Now former inductees are speaking out on how they feel the programme failed them: “Don’t gather some of the most brilliant activists in the industry, treat us like crap, and then expect us to do nothing about it.”

123a79c287a054d2de4b7ff8aaf52ff860f3b1e9,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/11/future-class-gamings-oscars-game-awards,‘We were effectively props’: young stars of game development feel let down by the ‘gaming Oscars’,"Tue, 11 Nov 2025 12:30:54 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"Video games have long struggled with diversification and inclusivity, so it was no surprise when the Game Awards host and producer Geoff Keighley announced the Future Class programme in 2020. Its purpose was to highlight a cohort of individuals working in video games as the “bright, bold and inclusive future” of the industry.

Considering the widespread reach of the annual Keighley-led show, which saw an estimated 154m livestreams last year, Future Class felt like a genuine effort. Inductees were invited to attend the illustrious December ceremony, billed as “gaming’s Oscars”, featured on the official Game Awards website, and promised networking opportunities and career advancement advice. However, the programme reportedly struggled from the start. Over the last couple of years, support waned. Now, it appears the Game Awards Future Class has been wholly abandoned.

This is the second year in a row Future Class has not announced a new cohort: there are usually 50 inductees across various games industry disciplines, including writing, development, journalism and community management. As reported by Game Developer, organiser Emily Weir confirmed they “are not planning a new Future Class for [2025] and do not have any active programming plans for Future Class”.

Previous Future Class inductees say this comes after years of internal advocacy and struggles to improve the programme. With the video game industry wrestling with another culture war over diversity, equity, and inclusivity initiatives (DEI), some members of the Future Class feel they were used for positive publicity, then cast aside when DEI was no longer in vogue.

“We were effectively props,” game producer Dianna Lora, who was inducted into the first Future Class in 2020, said over video call. “Once we got to the Game Awards (most people flew in from other countries, which was expensive), we showed up, and it felt like we were pushed to the side door … We found out later that Keighley had a party in another room with all the influencers and industry people. You know where Future Class met that day? At a Starbucks.”

“No one from official leadership even showed up until the meet-up was basically over,” Future Class member and Retcon Games creative director Jes Negrón said of that Starbucks meeting. “We were pretty bummed about just being cast aside.”

Elsewhere at that 2021 ceremony, Lora, community manager Natalie Checo, podcast host Kahlief Adams, and other Future Class inductees’ seats were behind one of the camera risers, completely obstructing their view.

Future Class inductees receive programme perks for the next 12 months: a ticket to the Game Awards (alumni were given discounts to buy tickets), and access to career advancement opportunities. Several people referred to the early career-focused events as chats with high-profile industry members such as former Nintendo president Reggie Fils-Aimé and Xbox head Phil Spencer, rather than proper mentorship programmes.

“It felt like Keighley just called a bunch of his friends to do Zoom calls,” Lora said. “It was inspiring to have these conversations, but that’s really as far as it went.”

Lora was one of several Future Class members who urged Keighley and Weir to improve the programme.

“They fought for everything the 2023 class got: the Future class mixer, [them] putting us up in a hotel for two nights, covering the flight … everything that I got was a result of my previous classmates,” writer and 2023 inductee Emma Kidwell said of previous Future Class inductees. More recent inductees praised the mentorship opportunities.

But 2023 also saw a high-profile clash between the Future Class and Keighley, which members believe accelerated the programme’s demise. In November, in the wake of increasing media coverage of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, more than 70 Future Class members signed an open letter requesting a statement be read at the December ceremony expressing support for Palestine and calling for a ceasefire. Though it gained media attention and was posted in the Future Class’s Discord, of which both Keighley and Weir belong, the letter was ignored.

Not long after, several Future Class members gave a virtual presentation to Keighley and Weir, acknowledging the importance of the programme while expressing concerns about its “goals, structure, and sustainability”. They offered suggestions for how to improve both the programme and the awards ceremony in general, such as featuring more female presenters, improved accessibility options, and an acknowledgment of the recent deluge of layoffs in the industry). Younès Rabii, a 2022 inductee, said that Keighley was visibly frustrated during the call, while another member said he was “incensed”.

Keighley and Weir did not respond to a request for comment.

Every Future Class member who spoke to the Guardian expressed varying levels of frustration with the programme and its untimely ending. “It’s sad that we were part of something great, that has amazing people, that was left by the wayside,” said accessibility consultant Steve Saylor. “I’m not mad, I’m disappointed.” Many believed the programme was disbanded because the inductees pushed for a better Future Class. “You have the influence, you have the power, and you can change sh*t,” Lora said, “But ever since [we pushed back] it was like, ‘This is too much trouble, might as well peace out’.” Checo added: “As a result of advocating for ourselves (the very thing that we were inducted for), we were punished for doing the same thing that they ostensibly celebrated us for.”

A few members wondered about the sponsorships associated with the programme (a video highlighting a 2023 inductee was presented by Old Spice) and if they were just being “tokenised” to help the programme make more money. (Presenting a one-minute trailer at Keighley’s 2024 summer games showcase reportedly cost $250,000, and sources say the Game Awards is even more expensive.) “They didn’t mention us at the 2022 Game Awards, except for a huge sponsorship that they apparently got in the name of the Future Class, which none of us were told about, and certainly didn’t see any money from,” said Negrón.

At some point, the Future Class page was removed from the Game Awards site, meaning there is no official archive of its members. “Not only are they discontinuing the programme, but they’ve also eliminated any way for us to claim the honour that they provided,” Checo said.

“Marginalised people need accolades because it pushes them to at least be on the same starting level that you or I might have,” said Kidwell. “Now people can’t put that on their résumés.” Negrón was curious about the thought process behind it all, saying: “Don’t gather some of the most brilliant activists in the industry, treat us like crap, and then expect us to do nothing about it.”

Many believe Future Class’s failure will serve as a cogent reminder that allyship without proper support is simply performative. And for some, not all is lost. Midnight Hour founder Elaine Gómez said the “camaraderie and community that was created by bringing nearly 200 developers and creatives from underrepresented communities together” was the best part of it all. Meanwhile, the official Future Class Discord is still going – and more active now than it has been in the last year or so.",2025-11-14T17:35:21.331828

Not literally of course, but try telling that to someone who has nailed Free Bird’s four-minute guitar solo in front of a packed living-room audience.

Developed by Harmonix, published by RedOctane and inspired by Konami’s GuitarFreaks, Guitar Hero gave players a guitar-shaped controller with which to match coloured notes scrolling down the screen in time with a song. Each riff or sequence corresponded to specific notes, creating the feel of a genuine performance.

Harmonix had already tried its hand at rhythm games with the PlayStation 2 titles Frequency and Amplitude when it partnered with RedOctane, which was purchased by Activision in 2006. Together they laid the foundations for an unlikely billion-dollar franchise that had a remarkable impact for many of the artists featured, introducing decades-old bands such as Cheap Trick, Kansas and Lynyrd Skynyrd to millions of younger players.

Michael Dornbrook, former COO of Harmonix, recalls the initial financial challenges of licensing the recordings – even though the first two games mostly used cover versions – but also how their bargaining power shifted once the game was a hit.

“We rerecorded all the music because the dollar figure was so high,” he says. “Even with the publishing rights alone, it was nearly impossible. We couldn’t get bands like the Who – RedOctane had virtually no money, and we were pretty convinced it would fail. But once Guitar Hero took off, and record sales and radio play were going up, everyone wanted to be in.”

He adds: “One of the amazing things was how many parents got in touch and thanked us for introducing their kids to the music they loved. It became a multigenerational thing.”

Northern Irish blues-rock band the Answer had Never Too Late included on the 2008 game Guitar Hero World Tour. Guitarist Paul Mahon remembers how the series brought classic rock back into vogue: “Guitar Hero offered a bigger, younger audience. Generally this had been seen as music that was past it, but then when it was featured on the game and teenagers were finding it, suddenly it was cool. That legitimised it, and got rid of the ‘dad rock’ tag. It gave all our music a new life.”

In 2008, the Answer’s debut album was still unreleased in the US, meaning the game was a key medium of discovery for the band as they went on a North American tour supporting AC/DC. “Their crew were playing Never Too Late on the tour bus, and some of them knew us from Guitar Hero,” Mahon says.

Rock’s heavyweight names soon capitalised on the series’ popularity, with Aerosmith, Metallica and Van Halen featuring in dedicated spin-off titles that focused on each band’s catalogue and associated lore, imagery and rock’n’roll mythology. In the case of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, it was said to have made the band more money than any of their studio albums did. It sold well over half a million copies in its first week, while sales of Aerosmith’s music saw an increase of up to 40% at a time when the music business’s established order was already collapsing in a changing landscape.

The series continues to inspire nimble-fingered fanaticism among its fans. Earlier this year, streamer CarnyJared completed an impressive attempt of DragonForce’s Through the Fire and Flames – a notoriously difficult power-metal song made popular by Guitar Hero – on Clone Hero, a freeware game with almost identical gameplay but an array of customisation options. This track is challenging enough on expert mode, let alone played at double speed and without missing a single one of its near 4,000 notes. CarnyJared claimed it took nine months of practice.

A mindboggling feat, but at what point does one pick up an actual guitar? “It doesn’t really matter, because you can’t play [that song] in nine months! There’s zero chance,” says DragonForce guitarist Herman Li, who considers the game world and the real world to be very separate. “Guitar Hero is a fun, fantasy thing. If you play Call of Duty, that doesn’t mean you should pick up a real gun and go to war.”

DragonForce had already wrapped up a successful tour when Through the Fire and Flames was featured on Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, but Li says it made them a household name. “I remember the record label calling to tell me that we were selling albums like crazy,” he says. “It exploded when we next toured, and we were playing just before the headliners Slipknot and Disturbed on the Mayhem festival.”

In fact, DragonForce’s exposure from Guitar Hero was so immense that it has threatened to overshadow everything else the band has done. Last year, the song was used in a trailer for Despicable Me 4. “In the past I thought differently, but I’ve made peace with it,” Li says. “If you only listen to one DragonForce song, it’s totally cool – everyone’s got their own musical journey and I’m glad we’ve been part of people’s lives”.

The best marketing, whether it’s for cars, clothes or video games, goes further than selling something – it evokes a desire. Did Guitar Hero tap into that? “That’s exactly what we were trying to create,” Dornbrook says. “That thrill of being a rock star on the stage. From day one, Alex [Rigopulos] and Eran [Egozy], who co-founded Harmonix, felt that there’s an instinctive human desire to make music, and they wanted to use technology to allow people to do it”.

The majority of Guitar Hero games were released in just a five-year period between 2005 and 2010, including spin-offs DJ Hero, complete with a turntable controller, and Band Hero, the two games releasing a week apart in 2009: Dornbrook says “Activision is famous for burning out franchises, they tend to overdo it”. After that, the publisher’s interest in plastic instruments died down, aside from a short-lived revival in 2015 with Guitar Hero Live.

Games such as Clone Hero and Fortnite Festival have kept the scene alive, and there’s set to be something from the original publisher on the way: RedOctane Games,, a new studio which has “entered production on its debut rhythm-based title”. Original co-founders Kai and Charles Huang are both involved as special advisers. Is the world ready to embrace another game in the spirit of Guitar Hero?

“We thought those games could be like Madden where you can update every year,” Dornbrook says. “There’s so much new music that it could be evergreen, so I’ve always been optimistic. There’s no reason why it can’t continue with new generations.”",2025-11-14T17:35:23.413203

Along with his friend Milton Nascimento, he created one of the most celebrated albums in Brazilian music history, Clube da Esquina, featuring many of his compositions. In the same year he also released his first solo album, which gained similar recognition as a Brazilian classic. Borges, who has died aged 73, may not have achieved Nascimento’s international celebrity, but he played a key role in transforming his country’s music.

Clube da Esquina (Corner Club) had its genesis in a group of friends who met up to play and write songs on the corner of Divinópolis and Paraisópolis streets in Belo Horizonte, the state capital of Minas Gerais in the south east of Brazil.

Nascimento was the key figure, as he was 10 years older than Borges, and already developing his extraordinary vocal style, mixing bossa nova, jazz and other influences, while Borges was fascinated with the Beatles. Nascimento left to find success, first when the high-profile Brazilian singer Elis Regina recorded one of his songs, and later when he moved to the US to record. But he had not forgotten his Corner Club friend, and his 1970 album Milton included three collaborations with Borges: Clube da Esquina, Alunar and Para Lennon e McCartney. Borges had been planning to join the Brazilian army, but was subsequently persuaded to follow a very different career.

In 1971 he, Nascimento and other members of the Clube da Esquina began recording their own wildly eclectic music. The lineup included Borges’s lyricist brother Márcio and musicians including Beto Guedes and Toninho Horta, and between them they produced an extraordinary double album of 21 songs that echoed everything from Brazilian styles to rock, church, folk and classical music. Nascimento’s voice dominated, but Borges played a crucial role, co-writing the opening track, Tudo Que Você Podia Ser, and other celebrated songs such as O Trem Azul and Um Girassol da Cor de Seu Cabelo.

The Odeon record label had been sceptical when Nascimento, a rising star, announced that he wanted to share an album with a then-unknown musician, but when they heard the songs that Borges had written they asked him to also record a solo debut. That album, Lô Borges, featured a pair of well-worn tennis shoes on the front cover and became known as “disco de tênis” or “the sneaker album”.

The album was largely spontaneous – he would sometimes write a song in the morning and record it the same day. Backed by musicians including Guedes and Horta, he mixed Brazilian music with rock and psychedelia, creating songs such as the slinky Você Fica Melhor Assim, the gently tuneful Cancão Postal and Aos Barões, the last of which later inspired the 2018 Arctic Monkeys album Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino.

Borges’s record company wanted to launch him as a major pop star, but he refused to comply. Exhausted from the sessions, he hitched a ride northwards to Bahia, living a hippy lifestyle there before returning to his native Belo Horizonte so that he could “go home to life on the street corner”.

From then on his recordings became more sporadic. He contributed songs to Clube da Esquina 2 (1978), and recorded a second solo album, A Via-Láctea, in 1979. He also released four albums in the 1980s and 90s, including the jazz-edged Nuvem Cigana (1982).

In 2003 Borges worked with the Brazilian band Skank, co-writing their song Dois Rios. His own later releases included Horizonte Vertical (2011), which included two contributions from Nascimento. He became increasingly prolific towards the end of his life, releasing a new album every year from 2019 onwards. Céu de Giz, recorded with the singer-songwriter Zeca Baleiro was released in August 2025, and according to his brother there are other albums, still unreleased.

Born Salomão Borges Filho – and known at Lô – he was the sixth of the 11 children of Salamão and Maria Fragoso Borges. He started playing guitar at the age of seven and formed his first band, Os Beat Boys, as a teenager inspired by the Beatles.

He was 10 when he first met Nascimento in the street, as he was on his way to buy groceries for his mother. Nascimento taught him guitar and composition, while in return Borges introduced him to his Beatles albums, and to his brother and friends. They started to play in the street, and the Clube da Esquina collective was born.

One of Borges’s final performances took place on the same street corner, strumming his electric guitar and wearing a Beatles T-shirt.

Downtime for DiDonato is made rarer by a punishing touring schedule that sees her perform around the globe in recitals showcasing her extraordinary vocal technique, while juggling major roles in classical and contemporary opera. She’s a regular at the Metropolitan Opera in New York and has sung in the world’s top opera houses, including Milan’s La Scala and Covent Garden in London.

Hobart represents a significant change of pace, but DiDonato insists she’s just as excited to perform to audiences here; she believes people tend to have less cultural baggage in cities without a strong operatic tradition.



“When you perform in a city like Vienna or London, the audience is often listening to your performance through the filter of their favourite recording,” DiDonato says. “But I love the challenge of singing for people where it’s new, or uncharted territory. I like to think that, at least energetically, I’m taking them by the hand and saying: ‘Come, it’s beautiful. You’re gonna be OK.’”

Her egalitarian passion for sharing music has seen her work with inmates at Sing Sing, a maximum security prison in New York state, where she has been performing and running workshops for a decade, and witnessing the transformative power of centuries-old music.

In Australia and New Zealand, DiDonato will be performing Les Nuits d’été (Summer Nights), a song cycle by French composer Hector Berlioz. “It is music that’s immediately emotional, beautiful and identifiable,” DiDonato says. “It has both the light and the dark, a little bit of humour and then the pathos. This is basically who I am as a performer, so it felt complete.”



Light and shade are quintessential DiDonato qualities, in a voice renowned for its exquisite coloratura, its control and warmth. It allows the singer to inhabit a stunning array of characters, from Handel’s “guns-blazing” Agrippina to the “solemnly mellow-toned Virginia Woolf” in Kevin Puts’s The Hours. It’s the kind of stylistic diversity that would make a soprano weep – and DiDonato is the first to say: mezzos have more fun.

“[We] get to do literally everything, far more than any other voice type,” she says. Rather than the doomed lovers or chaste ingenues into which sopranos are often pigeonholed, mezzos “play different genders, we play the princesses and the witches. And then there’s the sheer variety of music. I span four centuries pretty regularly”.

This range has been key to DiDonato’s professional longevity and the secret to her unbridled enthusiasm for the art form. “I have a huge musical and dramatic appetite and I can not imagine being constrained by a more narrow voice type,” she laughs.



While some singers find their voice emerging organically in their late teens, DiDonato had to work hard to locate hers, a task that occupied most of her 20s. “I don’t know that my love is my voice. It’s not that I don’t love it, but that’s not the thing that charges me. It’s the expressive potential of my voice, what I say with it, that matters,” she says.



“I align with composers that are first of all emotional storytellers, and that are not afraid to write a melody.”

Given how much contemporary opera leans into atonality, into sparse and complex soundscapes over memorable arias, this statement feels almost counter-revolutionary. And while a passionate and vocal advocate for opera’s continuing relevance, DiDonato believes recent developments in the form have pushed audiences away.

“It feels like, in America – and maybe worldwide – opera has lost its way,” she says. “Ticket sales went down, and I feel like there was this panic [in the industry], that we’ve got to be relevant, we have to change. And it’s almost as if we jumped ship from who we are.”

From her experiences working with prisoners, DiDonato knows how powerful traditional opera can be. She has witnessed hardened criminals moved by Handel’s Giulio Cesare, and knows that opera “puts into the physical realm, through vibration, what many of us have no access to verbalise and express. Especially today. We’re so blocked. We’re so frozen.”



Opera is vital, DiDonato argues, because “there are so few outlets in our society that really go there. It’s pure presence.” And it has a function. “We must, as individuals and a society, figure out who we are today in this world. And we do that by putting thoughts on paper, by putting our hands in clay, by vocalising and expressing our confusion, our mystery, our joy, our sorrow, our despair.”

“And that can happen in Tasmania, that can happen at the Metropolitan Opera, that can happen in Sing Sing prison. It’s the exact same experience.”",2025-11-14T17:35:28.923127

In an interview with Empire magazine, Nolan said: “I’ve been out on [the sea] for the last four months. We got the cast who play the crew of Odysseus’s ship out there on the real waves, in the real places … We really wanted to capture how hard those journeys would have been for people. And the leap of faith that was being made in an unmapped, uncharted world.” He added: “We shot over 2 million ft of film.”

The Odyssey has been entirely shot on the large-scale Imax format, which uses considerably more film than standard 35mm cameras. According to Indepth Cine, Imax cameras use around 337ft of 65mm film per minute,, compared to 90ft for 35mm. This suggests Nolan has shot around 100 hours of raw footage – which in fact compares relatively favourably to some other recent films; a log by editor Vashi Nedomanski suggests that Mad Max: Fury Road shot around 480 hours of raw footage, and Gone Girl shot 500 hours.

Nolan also outlined in the interview his reasons for picking the project, having been in line to direct another Homeric epic, Troy, more than two decades ago. “As a film-maker, you’re looking for gaps in cinematic culture, things that haven’t been done before. And what I saw is that all of this great mythological cinematic work that I had grown up with – Ray Harryhausen movies and other things – I’d never seen that done with the sort of weight and credibility that an A-budget and a big Hollywood, Imax production could do.”

He added: “By embracing the physicality of the real world in the making of the film, you do inform the telling of the story in interesting ways. Because you’re confronted on a daily basis by the world pushing back at you.”

Speaking to the same magazine, Matt Damon, who plays Odysseus, was effusive in his compliments for Nolan: “I can say, without hyperbole, that it was the best experience of my career … “I saw the [Trojan] horse on the beach and I was just like, ‘Fuck’. It was just so cool.”

Nolan’s film, which also stars Tom Holland as Odysseus’s son Telemachus, is due for release in July 2026.",2025-11-14T17:35:30.484089

My husband and I stayed in a beautiful 500-year-old Venetian palazzo for just €100 for a double room. The exterior of Palazzo Abadessa, tucked away in the sleepy backstreets of the Cannaregio district, is low key enough, but the grandeur and opulence begin to hit your senses as you explore. First we strolled through the lush ornamental garden, then the huge entrance hall decorated with frescoes and Renaissance paintings going back to the golden age of Venice, lit by glittering Murano chandeliers. The reception area is furnished with an antique velvet armchair, perfect for sipping a prosecco or Venetian spritz. Back in the 16th century, the original owners provided Venice with two of its doges, and today the stone corridors and high-ceilinged rooms have a classy, noble air, as if the ghosts of Caravaggio or Tintoretto might appear any moment and begin painting. Breakfast of cappuccino and croissants in the courtyard served by the friendly owners was a delightful way to start the day.

An Italian cookery school in an old castle

View image in fullscreen Photograph: Peste 65/Getty Images

Castello di Montalero, east of Turin in the heart of the Monferrato region of Piemont, is a beautiful building with history going back to the 11th century, though much of the present structure was built ​on the old castle foundations around 1700. It has been lovingly restored by the family who provide a fantastic residential cookery school, plus interesting outings and adventures. A once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Sitting above the Romanian village of Mâlâncrav in Transylvania, the 18th-century Apafi Manor is a beautifully restored manor house next to one of the region’s most exquisite Saxon fortified churches. At the end of a lush forested valley, the grand but comfortable interiors by the British designer David Mlinaric feature historic local art and furniture, making you feel as if you have stepped into a 19th-century historical novel. Enjoy candlelit dinners on the veranda made by a cook from the village, and while away afternoons in the magnificent library. It sleeps up to nine, and reasonable prices make for an affordable and magical retreat.

If you fancy going medieval, then this 13th-century castle perched on a cliff overlooking the Danube in Baden-Württemberg should satisfy. We arrived at Wildenstein Castle youth hostel via a punishing zigzag cycle up the near-vertical outcrop, having ridden from the grand old river’s source in the Black Forest. The whitewashed walls conceal a large courtyard with comfy rooms and a great tavern in a crypt. The panoramic setting provides brilliant views across the Upper Danube nature park and wonderful sunsets. It is reputedly haunted, and exploring the passages and alleyways for ghosts is great fun for all. The abundant breakfast had plenty of delicious pastries, fuel for the next leg of our cycle.

It is hard to explain the Pineapple. Stay to appreciate this 18th-century tribute to a fruit and the rise and fall of an estate. It is perched on the Dunmore Estate near Stirling, and was the location of our first Landmark Trust holiday. One wing contains two bedrooms and a bathroom, separated from the simple kitchen and comfortable living room by the Pineapple tower. It’s certainly quirky – walking across the lawn to the loo was a novelty for four nights. It’s dog-friendly and sleeps four, with historic reading and logbooks dating back to 1970s offering entertainment in the absence of TV and wifi.

In the city of Poperinge, one of the few Belgian towns that did not fall to the Germans in the first world war, Talbot House was transformed into a club to offer relief to British soldiers. The house has been very well preserved by knowledgeable volunteers, and the chapel in the attic is a very special place of remembrance. The rooms and breakfast are lovely and very much in the spirit of the original club.

Courtyard apartments in Seville

Seville is steeped in historic hotels, but most were more than my budget. Corral del Conde was surprisingly affordable and near the city centre. It’s a 16th-century corral (although it has Mudéjar origins in the medieval period) – a traditional community of apartments around a courtyard, with shared ovens and laundry sinks – and it’s incredibly pretty. It is a particularly evocative place for any fans of Spanish golden age theatre, because stages would be built in these corrales and locals would watch performances from the wooden balconies. For contrast, it’s a short walk from the giant mushrooms of Las Setas, a very different (and more modern) structure made of wood.

Our stay with children and older relatives at Alton station, a Landmark trust property in Staffordshire, was both exciting and relaxing. It has glorious Victorian features, including stunning Minton tiles, and one of the bedrooms was the ticket office. It is incredibly interesting for railway enthusiasts, and leisurely bike rides down the disused railway were enjoyed by all.

Fishers’ cabins in Norway

Touring the Lofoten and Vesteralen islands of Norway, we stayed in several historic fishers’ cabins, but the best place was a little wooden house in Andenes. It is traditionally furnished in 19th-century style and forms part of a small private museum. Alma House is redolent of a time when life for fishing communities was isolated and dangerous, but time at home was precious. Like many holiday rentals in Norway, you may have to share with other holidaymakers, but that only adds to the unique experience.

Winning tip: Parador paradise in Spain

We travelled to the Extremadura city of Cáceres for the St George’s Day celebrations – a torchlit parade of dragons crafted by people all over the city, followed by the biggest dragon being set on fire. But the star of the visit was the Parador hotel – a combination of gothic, Renaissance and baroque architecture. Cáceres is famous for its unspoilt old town (it features in Game of Thrones) and it made all the difference to feel part of it in our own medieval palace. We slept under a classically Spanish gilded, beamed ceiling, and sat out on our balcony looking over the town, and couldn’t believe how lucky we were.

1d95a4a4d6141a82b65bb22101f2d7aadeb5bd89,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/nov/13/redefining-the-rules-of-mom-style,Redefining the rules of ‘mom style’,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 07:00:24 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"A fresh newsletter from Blackbird Spyplane landed this autumn. Fashion’s most wise and witty tastemaker had written a guide to “cool mom style”, talking to newish mums. As a newish mum myself, the words reverberated through my inbox.

Among the pieces worn by the likes of designer Zoe Latta, designer Ellen Van Dusen and writer Natalie So were Pro Force martial arts pants and Marimekko-brights, Marni clogs and oversized yellow leather jackets. Gone were the cosy pumps and chunky practical boots I saw in the playground. Instead? Cool trainers that can go for miles, at pace, or be slipped on if your hands are full – Salomon “Snowclog Mid” sneakers, Nike Air Rifts, Asics Gel-Kayano 14s.

I’m sure I wasn’t the only one to rejoice at these women who didn’t see it as a vanity to (still) care about expressing themselves via their style, even as their babies and young children shotputted 10,000 demands in their direction – and society’s expectations for maternal self-sacrifice bore down. Changed bodies, changed priorities and forced hands led to roadbumps but sometimes they also led to less preciousness – more of a carpe diem approach to style.

I’m not saying becoming a mother made me suddenly dress better. Definitely not. Since having my kid four years ago, beyond those early months of feeling at home in dungarees and baggy men’s shirts, I have often struggled with dressing in a way that has matched who this new person feels like. Not only do old waistbands feel too tight, old aesthetics do, too. It’s hard to pinpoint.

Now, after the survival mode of early parenthood, with its cluster feeds, euphoria and chaos, what to clothe the new me in became an interesting side project to the main job of raising a child. And I’m not alone in finding that motherhood sparked something – more “Yolo” – when it comes to what I wear, along with a fresh levity and a desire to dress up more. Plus, there’s a defiance in the ways I now realise I can dress, which I once thought would feel out of reach the moment the baby hit the bassinet. Blame internalised misogyny, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that motherhood was not a one-way street to LK Bennett – instead, it made even dressing in old grooves feel new. Leaning into earlier “tomboyish” styles seemed pleasingly recalcitrant; getting dressed started to feel fun in unexpected directions. Except on the days when insecurities about my body win, I now for the most part enjoy thinking more about what I’m going to wear, finding a pleasure in it that I had lost.

For me, “new mum style” means playing around, not suddenly “dressing your age”; it means shunning ideas of “appropriateness” and letting the newness of, well, everything do some talking. Past generations likely did lose more of themselves. But what surely feels different now, is that “mum style”, and not just the Shirley Hughes kind, great as it is, is being given airtime – and celebrated.

Motherhood is a loaded time to dress: tabloids lambast “slovenly” school-run mums and so-called “slummy mummies”. But this isn’t another stick for women to beat themselves with. It’s a broadening, a relaxing – and there will always be space for those who legitimately don’t care. But for as long as I can remember, new mum style meant meh blazers with silk scarves, like the mother in Home Alone or, more recently, the linen shirts, chinos and demure polka dots of Rose Bryne’s character in Platonic, who is brilliantly not demure. Or Lululemon leggings and puffy jackets.

Historically in the popular imagination, motherhood has been remarkable for the ways in which it’s been seen to be detrimental to a woman: her looks, pelvic floor, wit, wardrobe. But here in this Blackbird Spyplane newsletter was rare emphasis on the interesting and rich ways motherhood can influence style, for the “swag-er”. And the evidence is everywhere, from the school run to the library, as well as at the recent CFDA awards, where Rihanna described her Alaïa suit as “postpartum-forward”.

For the why of all of this, the Brooklyn-based photographer and mother Sunny Shokrae looks to a cultural broadening: “The way moms are portrayed in the media has expanded and so with that people feel better taking more liberties.” Take the actor Jennifer Lawrence, who has become an emblem of aspirational “mom style”. The Cut recently coining her look as “momboy style, for the women who love the contrast between a leopard-print calfskin coat and gorpy Salomon sneakers”. With the help of conventional attractiveness, she somehow crafts Crayola-red, graphic T-shirts and forgiving silhouettes into elegant get-ups. Women who are mums are centering motherhood in their work and public personas, making the optics of what they wear feel more enmeshed with their identities as mothers. Take Beyoncé or Laura Marling, on arena stages and album covers. In fashion, Adwoa Aboah is in hoodies and asymmetric Christopher John Rogers outfits; Simone Rocha is in bows and bejewelled Crocs.

For Zoe Latta, one half of label Eckhaus Latta, who has a four-year-old, as well as a four-month-old: “Your body is changing every day – or your perception of your body and how you want to be seen is changing – and that has made me be a lot less invested in a certain sense of style, and possibly more experimental.” Your identity and your body have been thrown open, why not your wardrobe?

Shokrae has “had more fun with clothes since my son was born” – not least because she finds herself “genuinely inspired by his wardrobe”. Two years ago, she shared her style with industry tastemaker Leandra Cohen, for a section on her Substack called “What do moms really wear?”. What she really wears is “seaslug-Google-image-search pants” for the playground and Target sunglasses that remind her of the Smashing Pumpkins and “bring her back to herself”.

For some women, there’s a desire to reclaim something. Where “frump” is often a misogynist hell of a word that women dread being attached to them, Latta is leaning into it via muumuus. “The misogyny of what’s frumpy is actually really freeing – to ignore the idea of what’s sexy or unsexy to an external gaze and say: “‘I’m wearing this muumuu, and it rocks’.”

Some women feel a tug to dress more “grownup” after gaining the responsibilities that come with tiny hands and feet. Latta used to wear a lot of “worn-to-shit, tattered clothes … now, when I put those things on I’m, like, this isn’t helping me feel put together.” In those early months, the softness that comes with a decade-old moth-eaten T-shirt seemed homely, but a few years in, the comfort turned claustrophobic. I often still find myself in men’s shirts, but with more starch, less slop.

Of course, it’s hard to untangle what’s motherhood and what’s just getting older – but it’s more likely it will evolve into something new. Latta thinks her shift is “irreparable. Like, definitely emotionally there are some things that I don’t want to go back [to] … clothes that are of a time before.”

There is, says Shokrae, “no rule for how moms ‘should look’. That’s made up, and I think there’s a good number of women dismantling that old way of thinking. Mothers are dynamic, like all people, more tired, yes, but they are defined by more than just their role of ‘mother’. So, too, is their style.”

Back-breaking labour, sure, but so picturesque!

I was delighted, therefore, while on a writing retreat in Umbria last month, to get the opportunity to watch an elderly couple manoeuvre a giant vacuum around their haphazard orchard, followed by their furious sheepdog. The fallen crop was sucked into a giant fan that spat their bristly jackets back out on to the ground, and the nuts then went to be sorted by other family members on a conveyor belt in the barn – the good ones to be sold in the shell, the less perfect specimens swiftly dropped into a bucket for processing.

Later in the week, a lorry turned up in the village square to pick up bags from other small local producers, and that evening I roasted a pan of chestnuts on the fire with new appreciation, while loudly bemoaning the disappearance from the streets of London of the chestnut sellers of my childhood (though this makes me sound positively Dickensian, I can confirm that I’m talking about this century. Note also that Nigel Slater is less starry-eyed on the subject.)

If you’ve never eaten chestnuts hot from the shell – or if, like me, it’s been a while since you’ve done so – I urge you to seek them out, even just once. The vacuum-packed, ready-cooked and peeled sort are, of course, extremely convenient, and ideal for the likes of Jacob Kenedy’s grandmother’s braised quail with chestnuts, or his dad’s boozy montebianco dessert, but they’re a quite different beast from the sweetly smoky, roasted variety, so fresh that you scald your fingers on them and don’t care. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has some sage advice (and a sagey chestnut stuffing recipe) on the subject from 2006, and I doubt much has changed in that department in the past 20 years.

Though the season’s over by then, the nut’s association with Christmas means that net bags of chestnuts have already made their annual appearance in greengrocers and supermarkets, no doubt as much for their decorative value as their fibre content. My editor has yet to be convinced of the chestnut’s merits – mealy, he says. And, indeed, they were once an important subsistence starch in hilly regions such as Umbria and Tuscany, where to this day the ground nuts pop up in cakes (OK, this one’s Ligurian) and cookies (such as Giuseppe Dell’Anno’s castagnotti, pictured top), pasta (Giorgio Locatelli has a lovely sounding recipe with wild mushrooms), breads and soups (such as this Rachel Roddy number). But I’d argue that any such tendency to powderiness is, like so many issues in life, helped by the liberal addition of fat, as proved by Yotam Ottolenghi’s buttery chestnut frangipane tart, Angela Hartnett’s smoky bacon and ricotta fettuccine and Rachel’s buttery rice with pumpkin and sage.

As a one-woman chestnut marketing board for Britain, I hope this tempting selection makes it clear that the chestnut is not just for Christmas. Even Nigel’s inspired sausage and sauerkraut take from 2022 or Yotam’s satisfyingly named stuffing muffins from 2017 would work with a roast chicken or an equally seasonal game bird such as Blanche Vaughan’s pot-roast pheasant.

So, if you spot some chestnuts at the shops this weekend, hoover them up. Hessian sack and sheepdog entirely optional.

Cool beans | Or, perhaps, the best ratio of effort to pleasure: jarred cannellini beans tossed with Marmite butter, then served on toasted sourdough and topped with grated cheddar. The Food Foundation has launched Bang in Some Beans, a campaign backed by the likes of Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall to double UK bean consumption by 2028 – though they’re good for both us and the planet, two-thirds of the population eat less than a single portion per week. Not me, though. I love them.

All the food that’s fit to print | As someone who came of age in the last glory days of print, I’m delighted by its recent renaissance in the world of food. We may have lost Delicious magazine this year, but we’ve gained an occasional print version of Vittles, while the Pit team recently produced perhaps my favourite issue yet, on American food, featuring Uyen Luu on Vietnamese diaspora cooking in California, Chiara Arellano on the Black Panthers’ breakfast clubs and Annie Cheng on the history of Mississippi Delta cuisine. There’s also a recipe for my beloved deep-dish pizza, among others. You, too, can order it here.

Dinner party inspiration | I’m throwing a dinner party in tribute to the late and much-missed Jilly Cooper this week, so I very much enjoyed digging into the archives for inspiration: this admission, from a 2002 interview about her beloved local pub, the Bear Inn in Bisley, Gloucestershire, furnished me with the starter: “They know that I’m permanently on a diet, so they will do eggs, lettuce and carrots for me specially.” Just add a pleasingly 1980s avocado dip (no doubt too much naughty cholesterol for Jilly) and it’s a fine prelude to coq (up) au vin and a sloe gin-infused fruit salad (apparently the only pudding in Jilly’s repertoire, and described by literary agent Felicity Blunt as a “truly lethal … truth serum”). Rest in raucous peace, Jilly. We will be raising a glass to you.

Apple, brown butter and oat loaf

Prep 5 min

Cook 1 hr 25 min

Serves 8

180g unsalted butter

200g light muscovado sugar

2 large eggs

50g soured cream

210g plain flour

½ tsp cinnamon

40g porridge oats, plus extra to finish

1½ tsp baking powder

¼ tsp salt

2 eating apples

2 tbsp demerara sugar

Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and grease and line a 2lb loaf tin. Melt the butter in a saucepan, then simmer until it turns a deep amber colour and smells fragrant. Take off the heat, pour it brown bits and all into a heatproof bowl and leave to cool.

Once the butter is at room temperature, stir in the sugar, followed by the eggs, followed by the soured cream.

In a second bowl, mix the flour, cinnamon, porridge oats, baking powder and salt. Pour in the butter mix and stir to make a smooth batter. Pour in 60ml hot water and stir to combine.

Peel the apples, cut them into quarters and remove the cores. Set aside two apple quarters for the topping, then slice the rest into thin semi-circles. Fold these into the batter until they’re evenly dispersed.

Spoon the batter into the lined tin. Thinly slice the reserved apple quarters and arrange them neatly on top of the batter. Sprinkle over the demerara sugar and a few extra oats, then bake for 55-65 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the middle of the loaf comes out clean. Leave the cake to cool completely before slicing and serving.",2025-11-14T17:35:39.611813

Here are three worth making – and three that should wobble off to the bin,"Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:00:22 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"Jelly has a dowdy reputation, but it may well be the perfect food for the Instagram age: when it works, it’s incredibly photogenic, so who cares what it tastes like?

There can be no other explanation for recent claims that savoury jellies – the most lurid and off-putting of dishes, reminiscent of the worst culinary efforts of the 1950s – are suddenly fashionable. This resurgence comes, according to the New York Times, “at a time when chefs are feeling pressure to produce viral visuals and molecular gastronomy is old hat”.

The notion that jelly is having a moment is actually a perennial threat: this time last year it was reported that supermarket jelly cube sales were rising sharply, while vintage jelly moulds were experiencing a five-fold increase in online sales. And it was 15 years ago that the high-end “jellymongers” Bompas & Parr – known for their elaborate architectural creations – first published their book on the subject.

People who are sceptical about jelly are often put off by its origins. There’s no getting round it: gelatine is a pork byproduct, extracted from the bones, skin and connective tissue of the animal. But these days there are widely available vegan-friendly setting agents – mostly carrageenan and agar, derived from algae – that work just as well.

You can look at colourful, detailed, wobbling jelly creations all day long on Instagram or TikTok, but if you want to experience the jelly renaissance first-hand – savoury or otherwise – you’ve got to make your own. How hard could it possibly be? I decided to find out.

First off, a warning: there is really no such thing as a jelly recipe. You will find instructions everywhere, of course, but they will be of little help in your specific circumstances – the variables are simply too great. Moulds come in all sorts of weird sizes. Suggested setting times, in my brief experience, mean nothing: it’s set when it’s set.

Better to rely on some solid practicalities: fill your jelly mould to the brim with water, and then pour the water into a measuring jug – that’s the total amount of liquid you’re after. To calculate how much gelatine you’ll need, bear in mind that one leaf sets 100ml of liquid.

Confusingly, gelatine leaves come in four grades – bronze, silver, gold and platinum – all with different setting strengths, but you don’t have to worry about that because a) the size of the leaves is adjusted, so they all have the same per-leaf strength and b) you’ll probably only be able to find platinum in the supermarket anyway. But be prepared to adjust the exact proportions according to your needs – every jelly is a compromise between structural integrity and an agreeable wobble. If you just want it to stand up for a photo you can double the amount of gelatine, but the result will have the consistency of an eraser.

Soften the leaves first in cold water – five minutes should do it – and then add them to your liquid, making sure that liquid is hotter than 35C but nowhere near boiling. Once the gelatine is fully dissolved, you can pour the liquid into your mould and leave it in the fridge to set. That’s the basic technique – everything else is guesswork, practice and panic.

Grapefruit jelly

View image in fullscreen ‘An ill-defined blob’ … Tim’s grapefruit jelly. Photograph: Tim Dowling

I chose something simple to start with: Nigel Slater’s grapefruit jelly. I simplified his instructions further by replacing the words “halve and squeeze the grapefruits” with “buy some grapefruit juice”. The recipe calls for “six small sheets” of gelatine, which is confounding. They don’t come in sizes! So I fell back on 1 leaf/100ml – plus an extra half-leaf, because the Slater version isn’t for moulding. He just pours his into dessert glasses.

All went well until I tried to release the jelly from the vintage glass mould I bought from eBay. I dipped the mould into warm water for a few seconds – as most recipes direct – but it wasn’t enough. In my impatience, I boiled a kettle, filled a bowl, and lowered the mould into it. Only then did I realise it was too hot to retrieve, and by the time I came up with a strategy – ladling away enough water until I could grab the mould with my fingers – the outermost centimetre of the jelly had melted, leaving me with an ill-defined blob. The jelly itself was lovely though: not too sweet, with a bitter grapefruit note.

I learned a valuable lesson with this one. Onward.

Summer fruit in raspberry jelly

You can make your raspberry jelly from raspberries and sugar, or you can, as I did, just use diluted cordial.

The ring mould I chose for this was enormous. After measuring the total liquid capacity I calculated I would need 19 gelatine sheets – I had to run out and buy more.

The idea is that you fill the mould about three-quarters of the way to the top and let it partially set before pushing the fruits – blueberries, quartered strawberries, raspberries, whatever you’ve got – deep into the jelly. Even after several hours in the fridge, the jelly was insufficiently solid – the fruit kept floating back to the top. Perhaps 19 leaves was a miscalculation. Maybe I should have used 20.

Finally, about six hours in, the first strawberry stayed put. The fruit left an unsightly trail where I jammed it in with my finger, but I persisted until the whole mould was full of suspended fruit. Then I topped it up with more jelly, and left it to set properly. This took days.

In the end I turned my fridge temperature down until ice formed on the back wall. When the time came to turn out the jelly I was not hopeful, but it emerged in perfect condition – the fine detail of the mould was retained and the trails the fruit left had disappeared.

Then, slowly, the whole thing collapsed before my eyes, like a citadel in an earthquake. I put the wreckage in a bowl and ate it with a spoon – delicious.

Chicken jelly

View image in fullscreen ‘Bland and offensive’ … chicken jelly. Photograph: Tim Dowling

The first recorded jellies were savoury. In the 14th century, it took a lot of time, effort and skill to boil animals down to a transparent jelly, but the result would still have tasted too meaty to make a proper dessert. It took the development of industrial extraction processes to produce a clear gelatine with no taste at all.

More often than not, a savoury jelly consists of some meat or veg suspended in a gelled consommé or stock. My jellied chicken salad is a blend of several similar recipes I found online, because I was only ever going to do this once.

You can clarify stock by whisking in egg whites and then straining them, but my broth was pretty transparent after a pass through a sieve lined with muslin, so I didn’t bother.

The “salad” in this case was an arrangement of diced chicken breast, celery, parsley and halved tomatoes – nothing fancy. It set quickly, de-moulded easily and looked weirdly impressive – like leftovers encased in a glass paperweight – but a full 12 hours elapsed before I could summon the will to cut into it with a spoon.

We often use the word “bland” as a synonym for inoffensive, but it turns out some things can be both bland and offensive. Cold chicken stock-flavoured jelly is one of those things. I might have got used to it after several more spoonfuls, but I couldn’t bring myself to try.

Blancmange rabbit

View image in fullscreen ‘I’m pretty certain a small child would have eaten it without complaint’ … the blancmange rabbit. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian

Don’t worry, there’s no rabbit in this one – it just employs a plastic rabbit-shaped mould I bought online. I figured: rabbits are white; why not blancmange?

I’ve never eaten blancmange, or even really known what it was, but I think that what I imagined it to be was probably nicer than jelly made with milk. You’re never too old to be disillusioned.

The recipe I consulted uses cornflour to aid in thickening, along with sugar and lemon peel, but I also borrowed a tip from Bompas & Parr’s book: it takes a long time to dissolve gelatine in milk; it’s easier to dissolve it in a bit of hot water first, and add the liquid to the milk.

I will not share with you all the frustration of trying to release a well-set blancmange from a rabbit-shaped mould – the ears, in particular, really didn’t want to let go – while a photographer looks on. We got there in the end, with a big bowl of hot water and a lot of patience. The best I can say about my rabbit is that I’m pretty certain a small child would have eaten it without complaint. I didn’t have one to hand, and none of the adults in my house would go anywhere near it.

Striped jelly

Variegated jellies are a step up in terms of complication, but all you need is two or more jellies of different colours. I chose cranberry and blancmange, more for the visual contrast than the flavour combination, which I’ll admit in retrospect was jarring and not that pleasant.

Once you’ve prepared your jellies, the strategy is obvious: add layers of alternating colours to the mould, letting them set in between, firmly enough to stay separated, but not so much that the new layer won’t adhere to the one below.

I can’t stress this enough: ignore whatever any recipe tells you in terms of timing, judge the setting by eye, and be prepared to stay up all night. Your room temperature jelly mixture may coagulate while you’re waiting to add more, but a little gentle heat will liquify it again.

I would describe my striped tower as a qualified success – intact but a little lopsided. The main problem was that, instead of a jelly mould, I used an enamelled vase from Ikea. The cylindrical base created an airlock during de-moulding, which in turn created a lot of pent-up anger in me, and I got a bit violent with it. I’m not proud of myself.

The G&T jelly

I took this recipe from the Adventures in Jelly website. It sounded sophisticated, looked easy enough and would allegedly give off an eerie glow under UV light. The ingredients, apart from the gelatine and sugar, are the same as the drink: gin, tonic, lemon.

For this one, I decided to use the only jelly mould I already owned, which is old, ceramic and full of hairline cracks I thought might cause difficulty. I’m not even sure where it came from; I’ve certainly never made jelly in it.

Much to my surprise, this turned out beautifully, with just the right amount of wobble. And it really did taste like a solidified gin and tonic. I took it along to a dinner party (my advice for transporting jellies over distances is: do not) and everyone took pictures of it. Then they ate the entire thing.

Honestly, I was still getting texts about it the next day.",2025-11-14T17:35:41.353183

The show, presenting the latest collection from the brand Emmy Kasbit – known for transforming handwoven Akwete fabric into modern silhouettes – marked the official start of 2025’s Lagos fashion week, which took place in the former Nigerian capital last month.

From a dedicated catwalk space featuring more than 70 designers, to the American singer Ciara closing one of the shows wearing a gele – a traditional Nigerian head wrap – the showcase, which takes place every October, has come a long way from its early days of power cuts and a lack of interest from industry gatekeepers.

While the big four fashion weeks – New York, London, Milan and Paris – remain the industry’s undisputed powerhouses, Lagos has quietly carved out its own space on the global calendar.

Founded in 2011 by lawyer-turned-fashion-editor Omoyemi Akerele, Lagos fashion week continues to shape what fashion in Nigeria, and the wider African continent, is and could be. The event has grown into a five-day showcase and is attended by more than 15,000 people.

Acting as a talent-spotlighting platform, many of the designers who have shown at Lagos have gone on to achieve success on an international scale. Size-inclusive womenswear designer Onalaja’s designs have been worn by stars including Lizzo, Jennifer Hudson and Chloe Bailey. Lisa Folawiyo’s work has been celebrated for modernising Ankara textiles into bold, embellished luxury fashion. Kenneth Ize, who reimagines Nigerian aso-oke weaving, has shown in Milan, Paris and New York.

While the schedule includes pan-African designers, the focus remains largely on Nigerian talent. From Sevon Dejana’s couture-style glamour to Hertunba, a brand that riffs on traditional aso-oke weaving techniques to create fun geometric designs, Lagos fashion week aims to capture and celebrate the breadth of what Nigerian fashion looks like today.

“It has helped build so many names in the industry,” says Adebayo Oke-Lawal, the creative director of Orange Culture – a brand that was a finalist for the LVMH prize in 2014, and had a live show at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum in 2024. Oke-Lawal’s innovative designs, reshaping narratives around identity and masculinity, have been worn by stars including Ncuti Gatwa, Lupita Nyong’o, Dua Lipa, Burna Boy and Beyoncé’s team for Black is King, her 2020 visual album exploring African culture. Since debuting at Lagos fashion week in 2011, Oke-Lawal has become a defining voice for modern African fashion. “It’s not perfect, of course,” he says of the event, “but it’s consistent. It genuinely cares about designers, and that’s what matters.”

Still in its relative infancy compared with other fashion weeks – Milan was officially established in 1958 – Lagos has evolved since its inception. At the beginning, when the city’s creative scene was starting to form, there were teething problems: endless traffic jams, occasional power cuts in the city at large, and a long list of young designers waiting for their turn to build a name and a clientele. It was a fashion market with so much potential but without the infrastructure to help it grow.

Now, having been held at the central Federal Palace hotel for a decade, the structures are in place – with more brands showing, an impressive list of invitees, and sponsorship from major multinationals, including Heineken.

One of Lagos’ strengths lies in the fact that the industry moves differently in the city, being defined by community and storytelling rather than grand budgets or legacy houses. The result is more opportunity for creative innovation. Here, designers use their platforms to address themes such as sustainability, gender, identity and craft preservation, often drawing on community-rooted stories to do so.

Challenges are transformed into catalysts for creativity – something designer Bubu Ogisi of Iamisigo did particularly well this season. Her collection, Dual Mandate, transformed recycled materials and discarded fabrics into sculptural, thought-provoking pieces. It was a perfect example of how Lagos’s designers continue to make meaning out of limitation, creating beauty from what others may overlook.

Through initiatives such as the Green Access (which focuses on craft-driven innovation by asking designers to reimagine waste) and Woven Threads (which brings sustainable ideas to life through exhibitions and installations exploring community and responsible consumption), the platform has reshaped how designers and consumers think about fashion.

“Lagos fashion week is showing that sustainability can be liberating,” says Ogisi, who was the winner of the 2025 Zalando Visionary award at Copenhagen fashion week. “For us, it’s about finding new ways to express that, coming from the continent, using craft, and turning that into something truly global.”

Every year, five young designers are selected by Green Access to be trained in making their practice more circular, with a catwalk showing the end result. Alexandra Obochi was one of the designers chosen for this year’s prize, with Ifenkili, a collection that used indigo dyeing as one of its aesthetic techniques.

This focus on sustainability is, increasingly, recognised internationally. This month, Lagos fashion week was announced as one of the winners of the Earthshot prize, in the ‘Build a Waste-Free World’ category. It was awarded £1m, recognising its pioneering role in sustainable fashion.

Akerele said that the recognition wasn’t simply about her, or the event – but about the community of designers and young people who continue to prove that African fashion has something powerful and lasting to offer. “Fashion has the power to create jobs, preserve culture, and transform lives,” she said. “That is why we do this work, and why being a winner will allow us to keep pushing for a future where fashion is not just beautiful, but also meaningful and responsible.”",2025-11-14T17:35:45.157782

But as with everything else about the rise of Zohran Mamdani, his wife, Rama Duwaji, represents a new era of politics which speaks to a new generation of voters.

Married to the soon-to-be leader of the biggest city in the US, Duwaji, 28, is arguably the US’s first generation Z “first lady”. Duwaji is an artist and illustrator of Syrian heritage, whose work explores themes of Arab identity, female experience and social justice. Working in paint, line-drawing, ceramics and animation, she graduated with a master’s degree in fine art from New York’s School of Visual Arts in 2024. Her thesis was titled Sahtain!, an Arabic expression which translates as “bon appetit”, and explored the communal act of making and sharing a dish and its role in Middle Eastern culture.

It is fair to assume that one does not pursue a career as a socially conscious artist contributing line drawings to niche left-leaning publications with the aim of becoming a global celebrity. But Duwaji’s life took an unexpected turn when, in 2021, she met Mamdani. The couple married in February this year, about eight months before Mamdani was elected mayor of New York City, and Duwaji was thrust into the spotlight as New York City’s 28-year-old first lady. In the week since Mamdani’s triumph, Vogue headlines have included “Zohran Mamdani and Rama Duwaji Are Making Finding Love on Hinge Seem Possible Again” and “Fall’s Next Cool-Girl Haircut Is Officially the Rama”.

First lady is one of the most high-profile spots in US politics and culture. From Eleanor Roosevelt’s civil rights advocacy to Hillary Clinton’s healthcare reforms, the political wives of the White House have long been impactful players on the political scene. As the first lady of a city, rather than the nation, the stakes are more muted for Duwaji – but the buzz around her husband is shining a spotlight on both of the new inhabitants of Gracie Mansion.

New York City last had a first lady when Chirlane McCray, Bill de Blasio’s wife, oversaw a portfolio of mental health programs with a budget of $850m. (Eric Adams, the current mayor, is unmarried.) But the position has a significance that extends far beyond policy. First ladies are expected to fulfil the role of America’s sweetheart, embodying shared values and semaphoring tone with every public appearance. Michelle Obama’s recent comments, characterising the media’s fixation with her toned arms in sleeveless dresses as a strategy to “otherize” her as a Black woman, illustrate the extent to which the first lady discourse can become a cultural battleground around the status of women and people of colour, while the ongoing psychodrama about Melania Trump’s non-appearance on the cover of American Vogue speaks to an enduring fascination with the first lady as a poster girl for the US itself.

Duwaji’s victory-speech look was sober: all-black, with a high neck and calf-length skirt, and silver jewellery. But her low-key style did not deflect a feverish online reaction, with her chic dark bob and vintage-style boatneck top bringing instant comparisons to Audrey Hepburn. The outfit was notable for being consistent with Duwaji’s personal style, rather than a cut-and-paste political wife style. (“Rama Duwaji Is New York City’s First Lady, and She’s Not Wearing a Sheath Dress,” noted Harper’s Bazaar magazine approvingly.) Fashion industry paper Women’s Wear Daily reported her style choices under the headline “Rama Duwaji’s Election Night Look Bridges Brooklyn and the Middle East”, noting that Duwaji’s denim top, embellished with laser-etched embroidery, was by the Palestinian-Jordanian designer Zeid Hijazi. The choice of a Palestinian designer was widely interpreted as a deliberate and political choice by Duwaji, who has expressed clear and vocal support for the plight of Gaza. Duwaji’s velvet and lace Ulla Johnson skirt and silver Eddie Borgo earrings showed support for two independent New York designers drawn from outside the traditional high-status Manhattan names – Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Herrera and Michael Kors – with whom modern first ladies have been most associated.

In their style and in the story of their relationship, Mamdani and Duwaji blend youthful energy with traditional elements. Mamdani maximises his youthful advantage as a digital native and uses social media as a political broadcast channel, but does so while wearing the most traditional of outfits: a dark suit and tie. Duwaji, likewise, steers clear of the first lady cosplay of a pastel skirt suit, but her quirky retro-tinged elegance has a ladylike tone, albeit one forged in the vintage boutiques of Brooklyn rather than the department stores of Fifth Avenue. She has a taste for chunky flat boots and oversized white shirts, layered necklaces and winged black eyeliner. These are recognisable as the authentic style choices of a 28-year-old woman, but they do not present as challenging or radical. Likewise, their love story is both strikingly modern – the two met on Hinge – and solidly traditional in being formalised by marriage. Wedding photos shared on Mamdani’s Instagram show the couple holding hands on the subway as they travel to city hall, Duwaji wearing a vintage coat and her trademark flat boots with a short white dress, Mamdani carrying an umbrella. Their combination of romcom-worthy New York spirit and down-to-earth, affordability-conscious relatability has charmed the public.

In the ultimate cultural flex, Duwaji has already had a vibe shift named after her. “Aloof wife autumn” is trending on social media after a New York Post headline reported that the new mayor-elect’s “aloof wife … quietly steered his campaign from behind the scenes”. Duwaji’s husband is conspicuously absent from her Instagram page, where she posts street selfies in chic monochrome outfits and “things I saw that made me want to make art”. Her creative purpose and cool-toned self-possession are in striking contrast to the docile, gingham-aproned “tradwife” aesthetic that has stormed the TikTok algorithms in recent years.

As a visual artist, Duwaji is aware of the power of image-making. She is also comfortable moving in the circles of the more avant garde end of the fashion industry, recently attending a catwalk show for Diotima, which is helmed by Rachel Scott, an American designer of Jamaican heritage who is a rising industry star. Scott, who dedicated the collection to “the honour of all displaced persons”, said that she invited Duwaji because she was “intrigued by her work and her personal style”.

The stylist Bailey Moon, who helped Dr Jill Biden with her wardrobe throughout her tenure as first lady, was last week reported to have been working with Mamdani and Duwaji. Bailey, who is also credited with the recent high-fashion makeover of actor Pamela Anderson, is an experienced political stylist, who told Vogue that clothes “are part of the conclusion people make of an event or an appearance”. However, Moon told the New York Post that he was not on the Mamdani payroll, noting that he “shared some advice” but that no fee was charged.

For many young New York voters, who have not until now felt themselves represented in civic life, Duwaji’s style is more than ornament. It represents a shift in what public leadership can look like, and speaks to voters who are accustomed to absorbing news and understanding values through visual clues and messages.

But fashion? That’s my one holdout. At this time of year every store is screaming at you to buy a party dress – or dancing shoes, or a velvet suit – but I beg to differ.

The magpie instinct has a lot to answer for. Holiday season fashion is a tantalising pick’n’mix of sparkle and shine, and as the nights get longer and darker, we can’t help being drawn to their light. Then there’s the unedifying fact that the festive season creates a sense that it is perfectly OK to spend more than you have on things you don’t need, so long as it’s in the spirit of Christmas. Add to that the exciting but exhausting prospect that December is full of social commitments, and there is a tendency to panic that we have nothing to wear. The first wave of partywear is designed to dazzle you into submission at this vulnerable moment.

Party clothes feel important because the nights we wear them are memorable, but you don’t need loads of them as they don’t get worn that often

You know how it is when you are staying in a hotel with a breakfast buffet, and it feels completely impossible to decide between bircher muesli or croissants or an omelette, so you end up having all three and then feeling a bit sick all day? (Just me?) Fashion at this time of year is similar. You could lean into the nostalgic, black-and-white-movie version of Christmas with something timeless and chic in black velvet. You could do Christmas-cracker jollity in a fluffy sweater and novelty earrings. You could bring the party in a disco-ball sequin minidress. You could have a very-this-season Christmas in a mini dress and a Miu Miu-esque furry stole. How to decide?

First, take a beat. We are programmed as consumers to worry we will miss out if we don’t spend straight away, but you can bet your bottom dollar that if a certain look is a hit this week, there will be more of it on sale next week. Consider whether you want to lean into novelty or nostalgia. Party clothes feel important because the nights we wear them are memorable, significant nights, but you don’t need loads of them as they don’t get worn that often. Look around you, out in the real world and on social media, and pay attention to the clothes you are drawn to on other people. Scroll your socials not with the intention of clicking to buy, but just out of curiosity.

When you buy on impulse it is all too easy to ignore red flags that will sap your spirit, on the night – scratchy fabric, the neckline that doesn’t quite sit right. It is hard to make good decisions in a sweaty, loud changing room. Many times I have had to drag myself away from a prospective purchase and then never thought about it again. Those rare times when you wake up every morning for the next week thinking about how much you want it: those are when you go back and buy.

And I hardly need remind you that this is an expensive time of year. It can feel like you deserve to treat yourself, when you are buying so many gifts for others, but it is your money you are spending, so this is false logic. Evening clothes get worn lightly, so they stay in good shape: check what’s already in your wardrobe.

That feather-trimmed dress or sparkly knit can feel like destiny, winking at you from a store window. But waiting is really very Christmassy, when you think about it – Advent calendars, presents under the tree and all that – so take a deep breath, smile at the sparkle, enjoy the tingle, but walk on by. You can always treat yourself to a mince pie instead.

She emptied her savings account, pawned her late mother’s jewellery and took out bank loans. She became so overdrawn that she could barely afford food and lived mainly on soup.

She had sent this money, for all sorts of reasons, to a man she’d never met. The first was a $500 Amazon voucher because Sam, a consultant, was out on an oil rig and needed to buy a manual. Later, the rig required a new part; then the tanker transporting the oil ran into problems, too. She gave money to Sam’s daughter who was trapped in an abusive marriage. Finally, when Sam became ill, Elizabeth was contacted by his doctor and began paying Sam’s medical bills. “When this doctor messaged to tell me that Sam was in a coma, I remember thinking he had such a strange, unprofessional turn of phrase,” says Elizabeth. “He said, ‘I’m sorry to spill the beans.’” She breaks into laughter. “A doctor! How could I have been so gullible?”

The scam ended in August last year only because Elizabeth’s adult sons confronted her and broke the spell. Next came crashing waves of shock, along with shame, anger, fear and a strange, searing grief. “I was mourning a person that didn’t exist,” she says.

I’m often asked: who falls for this? The answer is: anyone who’s human

She still feels all of these emotions, which is partly why she now laughs. (“If I didn’t laugh, I’d never stop crying. Then I’d be no good to anyone.”) But she also laughs because, in hindsight, the stories she’d been spun now seem absurd. How could a sharp, funny, intelligent woman who had worked for years in the travel industry and spoke three languages have fallen for them?

Elizabeth, 67, asks herself this question daily, but the latest warnings from Lloyds show she is one of many. Over the past 12 months, romance scams reported by the bank’s customers aged over 55 rose by 52%. More than £106m was lost to romance fraud in the UK over the last financial year – and this only covers reported cases.

According to Dr Elisabeth Carter, a criminologist and forensic linguist at Kingston University, London, asking how someone could have “fallen for it” is to misunderstand the crime. “Even now, despite the numbers, warnings around romance fraud are along the lines of ‘don’t be fooled’,” she says. “We don’t tell people not to fall for a mugging or a sexual assault. It blames the victim for somehow being negligent.”

In fact, says Carter, romance fraud is far closer to grooming and abuse than it is to theft or burglary. “The methods used are intimately aligned with those we see in coercive control and domestic abuse,” she says. “The victim’s reality becomes so distorted over weeks, months or years that the decisions they make seem rational and reasonable. I’m often asked, ‘Who falls for this?’ The answer is: anyone who is human.”

Victim selection

“There’s no broad ‘vulnerable’ category, but there are situational vulnerabilities that we can all fall into across a lifespan, such as being bereaved, losing a job or moving to a new area,” says Carter. All these might make someone more stressed and distracted, and more open to an online connection.

In Elizabeth’s case, she had left an abusive partner of 37 years, finally moving into her own home with her youngest son who was in his 20s. She was in the early stages of recovery when she met “Sam”.

“I certainly wasn’t looking for anyone,” she says. “I was on a Facebook site about dogs when this person started chatting to me about the weirdest thing. He said that rabbits were eating his daughter’s plants. I sent him the Amazon link to a type of wire mesh. I accepted his friend request and he later sent me a picture of the mesh being put up and thanking me.”

Love bombing and trauma bombing

Their rapport felt instant. “He got my sense of humour,” says Elizabeth. “I’m quite sarcastic and he’d bat that back at me. I love that. It’s all my birthdays at once.” Sam claimed he was half American, half Norwegian, based in Texas. He constantly sent photos of himself, an attractive, bearded, grey-haired man going to work, eating dinner, living his life. “He sent poems and memes. He wanted to know everything about me and I opened up like a giant elevator. I had so much to say about my ex, so he learned my vulnerabilities.” (A year later, when Sam said his daughter needed funds to escape an abusive husband, of course Elizabeth helped.)

The attention was intoxicating. “When I needed dental work, he was messaging in the waiting room, bigging me up. Someone was actually being kind. I’d never had that before. I was spellbound.” Sam seemed vulnerable, too. “His wife had cheated on him,” says Elizabeth. “She was now with this other man, travelling the world.” Trust was important to Sam. He wanted to know if Elizabeth had ever been unfaithful. Would she hurt him too?

This trauma bombing is key, says Carter. “Slowly, reticently, they reveal things that make themselves look really vulnerable after initially seeming very capable,” she says. “It puts the burden of responsibility on the victim to keep the fraudster safe. It makes them misunderstand the power balance. They feel responsible for the fraudster’s feelings, determined not to let them down at any cost.”

Sam “overshared”. “He told me all his life plans in huge detail, sending me work contracts, and then when he took out a loan and remortgaged his house, he showed me all that, too. When he went for a job interview in California, he shared his location as he wanted me to see where he was. When he didn’t get the job, I’d feel all his disappointment. He seemed like a hard-working man with big ambition, stretched to the limit.” His financial pressures began to feel like Elizabeth’s. “I felt part of it, and responsible for his life.”

After six months of messaging, and the occasional short call, Sam messaged, “I feel like a whole thing is happening here but I don’t want to scare you?” Then he wrote, “I love you. Is that too much too soon?”

“My God, I was elated,” says Elizabeth. “I’d never heard anybody say that and mean it.” All this had happened without any requests for money.

Sleep deprivation

“Any time I heard the phone ping, I’d be like a puppy,” says Elizabeth. “If it was 2am, we could still text for four hours. I had him enabled so he was never muted, whatever time it was. If I woke at dawn, I’d be a demented beast, checking my phone.”

“It feels romantic, but sleep deprivation really degrades your cognitive ability to think clearly and make good decisions,” says Carter. “Victims don’t ever complain, as it feels like someone can’t get enough of you – but it leaves no room to think clearly about what’s going on, or even to talk to other people.”

Scripting, hyper-intimacy and isolation

Sam crept into every corner of Elizabeth’s life. He sent her music. “So many songs. The first was Sara Bareilles’ I Choose You. I started listening to her albums on a loop.” She loved online games such as Word Chums – so Sam downloaded them and they played together. Food was another big topic. “He’d go on about me eating, worried that I wasn’t eating enough,” she says. “He’d tell me what to eat and send recipes and pictures of his meals.”

Elizabeth sent him pictures, too. “Because of my last relationship, Sam was always telling me that I apologised too much,” she says. “So we had this thing that every time I used the word ‘sorry’ in our messages, I had to send a photo as a forfeit. The awful thing is that he has a catalogue of photos of me now. Some in my pyjamas, one in stockings and suspenders.” There was barely a moment that didn’t involve Sam. “I even started learning Norwegian,” she says.

“You’re not in the real world, you’re in this pretend, amazing world. I still lived with my youngest son and he’d joke about how I’d talk to him for five minutes, then get this hazed look and zone out – because there was always something going on with Sam.”

“A lot of this is scripting the most basic things we do,” says Carter. “Eating. Sleeping. Our daily habits. Those are being controlled really early on. It’s a short leap from ‘Eat this meal’ to ‘Send an iTunes voucher’.”

It also isolates the victim. “It prevents anyone from stepping in with a reality check,” says Carter, “and when the demands for money start, it stops victims from seeking advice elsewhere.” Fraudsters typically urge victims to keep the relationship secret, often saying that no one else could ever understand it. Sam didn’t do this – but still, the relationship’s intensity separated Elizabeth from her support system. “My sons were pleased I’d met someone after everything their dad had put us all through,” she says. “They made me promise never to give him money. I said of course I wouldn’t – so when I started to, I kept it secret.”

Dream building

“Ultimately, the plan was that when he came off his last job on the oil rig, I would fly to America to live happily ever after,” says Elizabeth. “It’s terrible. I’d recently become a grandmother but I was happy to leave my family on the flip of a coin.”

This final dream, this finishing line, propels romance fraud forward. “Everything is moving towards being together,” says Carter. Fraudsters do all they can to make it real – planning holidays, sending links to the best hotels, asking victims to house-hunt for their future home. They might escalate language, using terms such as ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ for one another. “For the victim, everything they do, any money they give, is moving them towards that end point,” says Carter.

Gaslighting and withdrawal

Sometimes Elizabeth raised questions. “Something wouldn’t make sense, like another request for money, or it could be something else. How was he spending so much time in a certain country without running over his visa? If I questioned anything, he’d turn it back on me so brilliantly.” (“I thought you trusted me?” “How can you say this?”) She wondered if the problem was her. Had her previous relationship made her paranoid and suspicious?

More harrowing were the times Sam disappeared offline for days. “I’d absolutely panic – my life just emptied.” According to Carter, this tactic guarantees future compliance: “After all the incredible love-bombing, they withdraw it and that silence feels terrifying for victims. What’s happened? Is it over? What did they do wrong? When the fraudsters return with some story about urgently needing money, the victim happily gives it. Anything to stop them disappearing again.”

End stage

“On some level, I’d realised it wasn’t right long before my sons intervened,” says Elizabeth, “but the brain is weird. I almost convinced myself that it was going to be OK as that was easier than admitting the enormity of it, the money I’d lost.” Her son found some of the paperwork in her bedroom and called his brothers. “It was a huge shock to them, but they couldn’t have been more supportive,” she says. “They made me see the truth, and they said, ‘All we care about is you.’”

Although Elizabeth wasn’t able to get any answers from “Sam” by confronting him (by this point he was supposedly in a coma), in Carter’s experience, the end stage of a romance scam can be truly chilling. The mask slips. “They don’t have to be nice any more,” she says. “Just like in an abusive relationship, when the abuser realises they are losing control, the threats can really escalate to ‘Now you’re going to suffer’. They’ll message saying, ‘I’ve got 15 of your naked pictures and four of your videos and I’m sharing them with everyone you know unless you send money,’ or ‘I’ve got your home address. Follow my instructions or I’ll burn your house down.’”

In the immediate aftermath, these possibilities terrified Elizabeth. “As well as feeling devastated and ashamed, I was a nervous wreck,” she says. “I saw a man sitting in his car outside my house and convinced myself he was one of the scammers. My son had to get a baseball bat while we spied on him through the window. He finally drove off, completely oblivious. The fact that somewhere someone has those pictures will haunt me for ever.”

Elizabeth reported it to the police, who told her that this was most likely the work of a criminal gang in another country, and the chance of a prosecution and conviction was very low. Her monthly Victim Support meetings with other victims of romance fraud have been a lifeline, she says. “Every time you think you’ve heard it all, someone comes with a story that shocks you all over again,” she says.

She did manage to get a large sum of the money refunded by her bank, though not all of it. “As for my own recovery, I’m right at the beginning,” she says. “I still ruminate on this every single day and don’t know if I’ll ever stop. The scammers are sick. They’ve got no soul. But they are very, very clever.”

How to stay safe

Carter says that all the advice about not giving money to strangers “doesn’t work with romance fraud. To a victim of grooming, this person isn’t a stranger.”

She suggests making sure you keep having conversations about your relationship with friends and family. “Grooming works on the person that’s in it, but not on those on the outside.”

Do some detective work, too. “Independently find two other pieces of information that corroborate what you’ve been told (for example, about where someone is based and what they are doing). Reverse-image-search all the pictures and videos you’re sent, and the prose as well. You can cut and paste the messages. Find the person online. If you can’t, they aren’t real. Everyone has a trace.”

Finally, remember that if you are being told to lie to your bank, “or being made to feel that your bank is against you, that is a red flag. The point when you are contacting your bank to transfer money is when you’re in arm’s reach of help, the last port of call before you’re rescued. Tell the bank the truth.”

We were in Oregon wine country, in a rustic-chic barn that reeked of stealth wealth, for a friend’s rehearsal dinner. “This venue is perfect,” I told the groom-to-be. He leaned in as if to tell me a secret: “I found it on ChatGPT.”

I smiled tightly as this man described using generative AI for the initial stages of planning the wedding. (They also hired a human wedding planner.) I responded politely. Inside, however, I resolved: if my future spouse came to me with wedding input courtesy of ChatGPT, there would be no wedding.

Some people have the typical relationship non-negotiables. Doesn’t smoke, is a cat person, wants kids. Over the past few months, as warnings of an impending AI-induced doomsday have dominated my news feed and party conversations, I’ve come up with a new one. I will not date someone who uses ChatGPT. (Or any generative AI program really, but with 700 million weekly users, ChatGPT is by far the most popular and thus the object of my scorn.)

I’ve heard all the “what ifs”. What if I use it for my job, but I hate it otherwise? What if I use it to help people? What if I only use it as a proofreading tool – I’d never use it to “write” anything. To all that I say: there are people out there for you. But I am not one of them.

“Getting the ick” is what we sometimes call being turned off. Part of having an ick is not really understanding why you found someone’s behavior so unseemly. For instance, I once got the ick watching a man drink a smoothie from a straw. At first, my ChatGPT aversion felt like a mere ick, a kneejerk feeling of disgust that lacked any solid reasoning.

But here we are, in fall 2025, and using the program even for benign tasks such as figuring out a fitness routine or deciding what to wear feels an increasingly political choice. We know that the energy-intensive tech drains our water supply and hikes electricity bills. It is sold as a placebo for human connection; lonely, disconnected people finding companionship or even falling in love with code is not as much a sci-fi plot point as it is just the way things go now. The megarich tech bros in charge of all this think in terms of profit first and people second.

OK, so ChatGPT helps you write your grocery list. Does your individual convenience outweigh the societal harm it can cause?

As if it hadn’t done enough already, ChatGPT has somehow made dating even worse. A good friend recently told me that she spent a night with a man, and in the morning suggested they get breakfast together. He took out his phone, opened ChatGPT, and asked for restaurant suggestions. Why get close to someone who outsources decisions, including the fun ones like picking where to eat? If someone is so lazy they’ll hit up ChatGPT to plan a first date, imagine how little effort they’ll spend six months in.

I just cannot imagine forming a deep, lasting connection with someone who regularly interacts with a technology that’s kneecapping our collective attention spans and perhaps heralding total apocalypse. Intellectual curiosity, creativity, originality – I probably won’t find what I value in someone who thinks “productivity” means asking an app to summarize a movie plot so they don’t have to waste their time, you know, watching it.

Ask yourself if your [dating] preference is truly serving your long-term goals Ali Jackson

Ali Jackson, a dating and relationship coach based in New York, uses ChatGPT for some tasks – but she is not an evangelist. In the past six months or so, she says “every one” of her clients has come to her complaining about “chatfishing” or people who use AI to generate everything on their dating apps – all the way down to the DMs they send. I asked Jackson if my strike against ChatGPT chumps was too harsh. She said no, go forth and judge, though it might limit my dating pool – about 10% of the adult population now uses the tech.

“Ask yourself if your preference is truly serving your long-term goals,” Jackson said. “In your case, I would assume that’s one of your values, and it’s important to find someone whose values are aligned with yours.”

Other people get the AI ick, and not just when it comes to dating. Ana Pereira, 26, lives in Brooklyn and does sound for various live music venues across the city. She fantasizes about going into her phone settings and deactivating AI features on all her apps, though tech platforms from Google to Spotify make it nearly impossible to opt out. Pereira thinks that using ChatGPT “shows such a laziness”.

“It’s like you can’t think for yourself, and you have to rely on an app for that,” she said.

Two of Pereira’s friends recently had a messy breakup. She sided with one of them after learning the other went to ChatGPT, a notoriously awful therapy alternative, not their partner, when they wanted to talk about their feelings. “It’s like they didn’t want to sit through any uncomfortable human feelings,” she said. “They just wanted to process something and move on, which is not how things work.”

Suddenly I couldn’t do it by myself. I was too reliant on AI to do the most basic things [at work] Luciano Nooijen

Richard Barnes, who is 31 and works as a marine biologist and restaurant server in Hawaii, is similarly weary. “I don’t know if I would think differently about someone who uses ChatGPT, but I would be like, ‘come on,’” he said. “You don’t need to rely on it to make a grocery list. Your life is probably not that hard. We can make the list together.”

When director Guillermo del Toro said he would “rather die” than use generative AI, it made headlines. Ditto for SZA’s Instagram stories tirade against the tech warning about “environmental racism” and expressing fear over users who are “codependent on a machine”. Ditto still for when Simu Liu, Alison Roman, Céline Dion, Emily Blunt, and others make statements that are critical of AI in their various industries. I think these quotes go viral for a reason: people agree with them.

Even, to an extent, the people who power the tech industry. Last month, Pinterest added a filter that lets users turn off AI content. Meta lets users mute, but not entirely deactivate, similar slop on Instagram. The Information reported that “cursor resistance” is on the rise, as some Silicon Valley techies won’t use AI to write their code.

Luciano Nooijen, a lead software engineer based in Greece and the Netherlands, told me that he enthusiastically used AI in the past to write or punch up his coding. Over time, he found he could not code on his own. “I’d done it on autopilot in the past,” said Nooijen, who is 27. “Then suddenly I couldn’t do it by myself. I was too reliant on AI to do the most basic things [at work].”

Nooijen stopped using AI to code, and uses it very sparingly in his personal life. He will make fun of friends who use it too much. He recently met up with an old friend who lives a three-hour train ride away. They decided to meet in the middle. The friend said he would use ChatGPT to find the right spot, but Nooijen just looked at a map. “There’s a city exactly between us,” he said. “Why do you need to ask ChatGPT for that?”

It’s not that I want to date a machine-smashing luddite (though I wouldn’t be opposed). Naive as it may sound, I want to live a life free of ChatGPT’s chokehold. I recently put this stance on a dating app profile, answering Hinge’s “You should *not* go out with me if” prompt with: “you use ChatGPT for literally anything.” It helps get the point across.",2025-11-14T17:35:53.476034

With John there’s never any pressure, unlike in my old relationship

About five years ago I came out of a relationship of more than 30 years and really didn’t expect to meet anybody else. I tried internet dating, but felt like a dinosaur. It was so confusing – people would just say “Hi” and then not contact you for a week.

John kept popping up, and when we finally met, about two years ago, I thought, “Oh my God, he’s lovely. There was a real spark.”

I couldn’t believe I really fancied him – and that everything worked. When you haven’t had sex for a long time you think nothing will work anymore. I thought I was old and dried up, and then I found out I wasn’t at all. The sex was instantly very good. I walk around with the most ridiculous smile on my face. The joy is unbelievable.

John is someone with amazing stamina. You feel like you’re in your 20s. The only difference is you’re knackered the next day

In the beginning, we were having sex every day. It was so nice, though now we live together real life gets in the way. But as long as we’ve got time, we have sex, so it’s not for a lack of desire. We’re probably down to about once a week now. The big difference with John is that there’s never any pressure, unlike in my old relationship. The more pressure there is, the more it puts you off sex.

If we’re too tired to have sex at night, we’ll plan for a couple of hours in the middle of the day because we know that a quickie isn’t going to really do it for me, and John has amazing stamina. You feel like you’re in your 20s. The only difference is you’re knackered afterwards.

I’m sure we’re super vanilla in what we do – we’re not kinky. It’s just healthy, great sex. The big thing is that because we’re older we need a lot of time. In the beginning, we would go to bed at 11, and then still be up at three in the morning.

Being older, you know what you want and it’s not about just lust. It’s about a real, deeper connection.

Claudine will say I have a very short memory, but each time is always the best

After separating from my wife 10 years ago, I started using the dating apps. It changed my life overnight, from feeling quite alone to being really excited for life and meeting new people. I had quite a lot of dates, and the majority of those ended up with sex of some description.

In all my relationships, sex has been very important. And with Claudine it’s really, really nice. She says I just have a very short memory, but each time is always the best. I suppose it’s because there seems to be an equal level of understanding, pleasure and communication.

We only ever have slow sex. And for that we need at least an hour. Finding that time isn’t as easy as when we first started

We only ever have slow sex. And for that we need at least an hour. Finding that time isn’t as easy as when we first met. Then we were probably having at least one and sometimes two sex sessions a day, and walking around half dead due to lack of sleep. Now we are living together – and have been for a year – the frequency has reduced. The way we end most days is going to bed together, sometimes completely naked, sometimes with underwear on. Ordinarily she will have her back to me, I think it’s called spooning. There’s a lovely closeness in that.

One of the advantages of getting older is that I don’t come so quickly. When I was younger, I could never have spent this long in foreplay, being touched and caressed without coming. Instead of having maybe 15 minutes of pleasure – which it may have been in my previous relationships – it runs over an hour and it feels very exciting.

In fact, many of our lovemaking sessions won’t actually involve penetrative sex. And that’s OK too, it’s about building up to a crescendo.",2025-11-14T17:35:55.599633

He worked in construction and the sprawling transient accommodation for the hundreds of families who’d relocated to build an aluminium plant became our home. I was going on 16 and sulking about having to change schools, again. Then I met Paul.

Back in those days people made their own fun. We often had huge parties at the caravan park, and Paul, an apprentice electrician, would volunteer to rig up the lighting.

Despite the age difference (he’d just turned 21), we became friendly. My parents and I were sharing a 15ft caravan, and while they adored Paul, he was never allowed inside.

For two years we’d spend hours under the awning chatting away. He’d pick me up from my ballet classes, and on Friday night we’d get fish and chips with my parents and sit on a little hill overlooking the beach drinking cheap white wine.

In the most innocent way I considered him my boyfriend, and he sort of became part of the family. My mother was mildly horrified when he gave me a friendship ring but I wore it so proudly and still have it today. I was incredibly naive, but Paul was always so respectful.

Then my family packed up again and I spent months sending Paul lovelorn letters from Darwin, on pastel purple paper drowned in Imprevu perfume.

Eventually the letters stopped and life moved on.

I finished school and set off on a big American road trip on the way to Central America: LA, New Orleans, Florida and then spent about seven months staying with a family friend on an oil rig encampment in Venezuela, surrounded by barbed wire and guards.

Meanwhile, little did I know that Paul had washed up in Darwin looking for me. For reasons we’ve never really been able to work out, my mother took him in and encouraged him to save money to meet me in the United States.

Communicating via snail mail, we arranged to meet in Miami. He booked two hotel rooms, but we only used one. We didn’t leave the hotel for days – I guess we were making up for lost time. As he says, “We lived on room service and love, at last.”

We started Greyhound hopping, travelling where the wind blew us. We were in Orlando for the opening weekend of Disney World in 1971 and stayed in the resort there. They had some wandering musicians who took requests, and we had them perform Moon River for us. I knew then the relationship had really taken off and I never heard that song again without thinking of him.

We travelled to the UK and finally found our way home to Darwin by Christmas. There, Paul asked my father for my hand in marriage. He was OK with it, but once again my mother baffled us all by totally disapproving, despite the fact she’d been the one who encouraged him to come and meet me overseas. I don’t know what she thought was going to happen on that trip, but I guess us getting married at the end wasn’t part of her plan.

Things between me and Paul fell apart after that, yet he remained firm friends with my family and all our friends, so I always knew what was going on in his life.

Paul married, had a family and built his own boat, taking eight years to sail it from Australia to the Mediterranean. Despite all his adventures and happy marriage, he says he always held a flame for me.

By 2011 I had two adult children, had been divorced for over a decade and was living in Perth. Paul tracked me down and what was supposed to be a friendly catch-up at a cafe while he was visiting for work eventually spiralled into much more.

My friends thought I was crazy for getting caught up with my still-married childhood sweetheart, but in the 40 years we’d been apart I’d never felt anything like the feelings I still had for Paul.

We handled things as respectfully as possible but that doesn’t mean people weren’t hurt. It has taken time to rebuild some relationships that were damaged.

In 2015 we walked to our beachfront altar to Moon River.

Every time Paul has come into my life there have been moments I knew he was the one for me. But when you are young you can be blind to how rare they are in life. It was only with the benefit of hindsight that we could both fully grasp how profound our connection was.

While there were a few lighting bolts along the way, ours was a slow burn. When we reunited in our 60s it felt, quite simply, like coming home.

But are they actually good for you?

In one study, researchers observed that 8.5% of Americans reported using massage for “overall health” in the 2022 National Health Interview Survey. However, definitions of health tend to vary widely, explains the study’s first author, Jeff Levin, an epidemiologist and distinguished professor at Baylor University. For instance, does it refer to physical health, mental health or both? That makes it tough to study, but may explain why it has such broad appeal, Levin explains.

Research typically seeks to establish precise causal relationships. But the impact of massage seems to be holistic in nature, integrating physical, emotional and neurological effects, explains Niki Munk, licensed massage therapist, associate professor at Indiana University Indianapolis, and research director of the Massage Therapy Foundation.

While some perceive massage as a luxury, it has historically been part of healthcare, notes Munk. It is increasingly embedded as a feature of hospital care because research and patient experiences corroborate its potential advantages.

Experts say massage may benefit anyone regardless of their health status.

What are the physical benefits of massage?

Massage is one of the techniques Rocco Caputo, a touch therapist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Center, uses to help patients.

“When patients come in, they’re always like: ‘You’re the massage guy, right?’” Caputo says. “Then you’re everybody’s favorite person.”

Massage helps people re-establish a connection to their body, says Caputo. It puts people into a parasympathetic nervous state, which induces a state of calm. Recent research conducted in part at MSK found that massage helped advanced cancer patients with long-term pain reduction. One of the outcomes of this research is the Imagine project, which aims to implement massage and acupuncture in cancer programs across the US.

Some research shows benefits for those with chronic pain; in Munk’s newest pre-print paper, veterans who received massage therapy twice a week for 12 weeks experienced an improvement in pain severity compared with a control group. These benefits were maintained for a period of three months.

“A lot of pain is a symptom that needs to be managed, not something that’s necessarily going to go away,” says Munk. The study didn’t examine the mechanisms behind the improvement, but Munk suggests that factors such as loosening muscles, relaxation and improved sleep could explain the results.

In another study, Munk found that after 10 massage sessions, patients showed clinically meaningful improvement in lower back pain. Participants aged 50 and older experienced the most significant change.

Massage therapy can probably address many types of pain; early intervention might even prevent some cases from becoming chronic, Munk says. But some researchers, such as the authors of this 2024 systematic review, argue there’s a need for more randomized controlled trials – viewed by some as the gold standard for measuring effectiveness – to assess how well it can treat pain.

Causes for the physical effects of massage are still being explored. For example, Shane Phillips, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, co-authored a paper demonstrating that massage enhances blood flow and reduces muscle soreness after exercise. The study found that even people who had not exercised experienced improved vascular function, or the ability of blood vessels to regulate blood flow and pressure, after massage.

One group of participants exercised with a leg press machine, then received leg massages. Testing shows that “blood flow in the arm was changed even though we were providing massage to the lower extremities,” says Phillips. This suggests massage may affect the entire body, not just a specific area.

Were the results due to manual manipulation of the body or emotional responses to being touched? “That’s not really known – it may be some of both,” says Phillips.

Are there emotional benefits to massage?

It’s difficult to untangle the emotional and physical reactions people experience due to massage, says Dr Carla Kuon, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and a faculty member at the Osher Center for Integrative Health.

Massage therapy can increase the release of endorphins, natural pain-relievers made by the body, she explains. A wealth of research shows that positive, consensual touch can increase mental wellbeing and reduce anxiety and depression.

Working as a massage therapist, Anne Weisman observed benefits for people living with HIV/Aids. In subsequent research, Weisman, who is an associate professor and director of Well-Being & Integrative Medicine at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, quantified these observations: participants self-reported a newfound awareness of their body that influenced motivation and resilience. One participant said “massage therapy reminded her of her human-ness”, recalls Weisman.

Weisman sees the effects of massage as “highly translatable” to different groups of people.

Who can massage help?

Kuon was seeking an opioid-free way to ease patients’ pain. In 2017, inspired by UCSF’s pediatric bone marrow transplant massage program, she raised funds, then launched a similar service for adult patients the following year.

A 2018 study on the adult service showed the massages were “quite beneficial for distress, pain, tension, anxiety, fatigue and improved sleep”, says Kuon. Participants also reported an improved sense of wellness.

According to Kuon, many studies show that pleasant touch creates a soothing effect, sending signals to the brain that you’re safe.

“We all thrive on caring, compassionate touch,” says Kuon. “I think any person could benefit [from massage] because it releases natural endorphins that promote a sense of wellbeing and happiness.”

But, she also notes that those who might get the most out of it are “those who may not regularly experience healthy touch”. Examples include individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome or long Covid, who often experience reduced social interaction.

Individuals “who have greater experiences of disability, pain and impairment are in a position to experience the larger effects”, agrees Munk.

How can you incorporate massage into your routine?

The benefits of massage serve as a reminder of the power of touch overall, says Weisman. Massage is a simple yet effective intervention but is often overlooked, she explains.

Professional massage may be inaccessible for some due to cost. But “some form of therapeutic touch” is essential, says Kuon. Even self-massage or a foot massage can be beneficial.

Caputo recommends incorporating massage techniques into self-care; he has created videos people can follow at home to help with ailments such as headaches and hand pain. (The intended audience for the videos is children, but Caputo says anyone can use them.)

Levin argues for framing massage as a mainstream health intervention. “When massage is described as an alternative medicine, whether it’s intended or not, there’s something kind of disparaging about it,” he says.

Massage should be further embedded in the healthcare system, covered by health plans, says Munk. This way, massage can be “accessible to as many people as possible”, she says.",2025-11-14T17:35:59.876426

I felt as though my career as a freelance journalist was on permanent life-support, I was juggling a hectic family life, and I was consumed with worry about a world seemingly hellbent on self-destruction. I was struggling, too, with the death of a close family member and an old school friend. Grieving had become a default status. Despite support from family and loved ones, I needed to find a way to cope with this nearly overwhelming sense of loss.

I tried meditation, yoga and therapy, which all helped. Then I heard of Community Sauna Baths, a not-for-profit project in London designed to make saunas accessible and affordable for everyone. From my very first visit, I felt something change. A sense of peace came over me. It immediately felt like a sanctuary, a pocket of calm in the chaotic city that also allowed me to soothe this churning sadness and release some of the bottled-up angst.

Now, I visit regularly. I tend to go alone but the atmosphere is always friendly and welcoming, and it’s easy to strike up conversation with other guests. Even on busy days, people go out of their way to give each other sauna bench space. There’s a genuine sense of community.

There are so many benefits to saunas, I now realise. They reduce stress by releasing endorphins, and help to improve cardiovascular and muscle health. My hamstrings, which usually feel as if they’re permanently encased in cement, have loosened up dramatically. I feel so much more flexible now. I also enjoy the sensory experience of saunas: the smell of the wood, the sizzling of water ladled on hot stones – and, though perhaps less so, the bracing shock of the cold plunge pools afterwards, in which I tend to last a matter of seconds before bailing …

I’d always prided myself on my ability to take heat. Partly, I assumed, it had to do with my mum’s Anglo-Indian heritage; partly, a few childhood years living in the scorching Middle East. But I usually – foolishly – framed this ease with higher temperatures as some kind of endurance test.

I’ve visited saunas before, sporadically, but they turned into how-long-can-you-last competitions, my sweat-soaked torso and singed nasal hair becoming some sort of weird perseverance prize. The therapeutic part of the experience went up in steam.

But now my visits to the sauna feel like exercises in mindfulness; the heat helps you stay focused and present. It feels as if my negative thoughts are being flushed away. It’s like a deep cleanse for body and soul.

I emerge from a session feeling rejuvenated, both deeply relaxed and strangely energised. It helps realign my sense of emotional balance. I feel physically and mentally more limber, too, as if some of my old anxieties have literally evaporated. My future is still uncertain but I know I can face it now with the heat of new vigour and purpose.",2025-11-14T17:36:01.688471

Then I built a daily survival pouch,"Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:00:52 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"I’ve spent a lot of this year trying to perfect the art of leaving the house.

This might sound like an odd mission until you’ve seen me spend 25 minutes getting distracted while looking for my wallet and sunnies, doubling back to grab my laptop, tripling back for my work pass, missing my train, arriving at my destination with 1% battery and only then realising the medication I was meant to take that morning is still sitting on the counter.

Part of this is undoubtedly because I have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but also, that’s a lot of things to remember all at once, no matter your neurotype and especially if you’re rushing or stressed.

So rather than continuing to scold my brain and telling it to “just do better”, I decided to give it what it actually needed: fewer things to remember and better ways to remember them.

That’s why there’s now a checklist of essentials taped to my door, a portable-power bank charging station next to the ledge where I keep my sunglasses, an A4 brochure holder stuck on my wall to hold prescriptions and other important documents, and a designated corner for my bag, so (ideally) it never travels more than a metre into my home (and thus risk disappearing into the abyss).

Even then, there’s all the little stuff to contend with. The useful bits and bobs – such as Band-Aids and breath mints – that make your day easier when you have them to hand.

If you’re anything like me then you might have stocked up one bag with all the essentials, but what happens when you decide to take a briefcase instead of a backpack? Look me in the eye and tell me you actually remembered to change everything over.

This is an executive-functioning burden I’ve managed to take off my brain’s plate.

All you need to do is create the ultimate, easily transferable survival pouch containing everything you could possibly need when you find yourself in a bind.

How to choose your items

Everyone’s daily needs will be different, and with pouch real estate at a premium. So you need to be judicious about what you choose to include – eventually.

In an ideal world you’d keep a list in your planner, and every time you or someone you’re with needed something, you’d make a note and eventually add that to your pouch. But realistically, who thinks to quickly write down “nail clippers” when there’s blood everywhere from trying to fix a hangnail the old-fashioned way?

So try doing it backwards. Go through your house and find everything you think would be useful to have while you’re out and about, and put it all into a large, temporary pouch. Carry that around for a couple of weeks, then when you inevitably get sick of it being so goddamn heavy, lay all its contents out on a table, take an audit of the objects you actually used, then banish the underperformers back to your cupboards.

If you want a head start, I went through this exact process. After two months of daily carrying, here’s what made the cut.

My daily survival pouch

The smallest deodorant I could buy

The smallest sunscreen I could buy

A small tube of hand cream

Stain-remover pen

Silent fidget toy

Pen

Tissues

A tiny bottle of iodine antiseptic (surprisingly my most-used item)

A few Band-Aids

Three safety pins

Nail clippers (with filer)

A little travel perfume/cologne bottle (you can refill it from bigger perfume bottles at home)

Strips of double-sided fashion tape

A sanitary pad/couple of tampons

Travel-sized mascara, concealer and eyeliner

Two hair ties

A couple of individually wrapped lens-cleaning wipes I stole from my mum

A mini pharmacy box with compartments containing: Three days’ worth of all my daily medications Basic painkillers (ibuprofen/paracetamol) Allergy tablets Cold and flu tablets Throat lozenges A few mints (saves you having to carry a whole box)



Note: Small pill containers are available for a couple of dollars and are handy for organisation, but you can use any pouch if you make sure to keep all the medications in their blister packs or you’re 5 million per cent sure you can always tell them apart.

All up my kit weighs 240g, and fits in a 23 × 17 cm pouch, which I barely notice in my bag. I even place all the smallest items in their own tiny pouch-within-a-pouch, to make finding things easier.

My overflow pouch

On top of that I have an overflow “work pouch” that never leaves my work backpack, which contains:

Travel-sized dry shampoo

Travel-sized wet wipes

Travel-sized makeup wipes

High-glucose jelly beans in case my meds mean I forget to eat (ADHD medication can suppress appetite)

Spare undies (you never know)

A deck of cards

Oh, and I forgot to tell you the best bit of all of this!

But that’s not always the case, says Adam Collins, a researcher from the Centre for Nutrition, Exercise and Metabolism at the University of Bath.

Sweating, he says, is part of the thermoregulation process. When your body temperature rises, it signals to your brain to sweat in order to cool you down. As the sweat evaporates, it helps regulate your core temperature.

One reason temperature rises is exercise. “When we exercise, the energy we produce to fuel that activity creates heat as a byproduct,” says Collins. The more intense the workout, the more heat is generated – and usually, the more you sweat. But sweat levels can be misleading.

If you went on an easy run on a hot, humid day, you’d probably sweat a lot. But on a cold day, you might barely sweat at all

“There are many other factors that influence how much you sweat,” he adds. These include the temperature of the environment, your clothing and humidity. In humid conditions, sweat evaporates less efficiently, making you feel sweatier than usual, whether or not you’re working hard.

“If you went on an easy run on a hot, humid day, you’d probably sweat a lot,” he says. “But on a cold day, you might run at a much higher intensity and barely sweat at all.”

Sweat also varies from person to person. Your fitness level, age, sex, body size and even whether you’re acclimatised to the climate you’re in all play a role.

So, no, sweat isn’t a reliable measure of how hard you’ve worked out. Better indicators of exertion include how hard you’re breathing, your perceived effort, and your heart rate, which you can track with a chest strap monitor or smart watch. That said, “sweat is a good marker of dehydration”, says Collins. So if you come out of a workout dripping, you’ll need to grab a drink.",2025-11-14T17:36:06.146300

Before that, I had tried the drums and the clarinet. They didn’t quite stick. But when I blew my first note on the trumpet, it resonated with me in a way nothing else had. From that moment, I knew: this was my instrument.

Since then, I’ve dedicated myself to music. I teach students from diverse backgrounds and nationalities to share my love for the trumpet with others. I’ve seen first-hand how little recognition musicians and musicologists receive. Music demands so much time, discipline, money, and years of study – yet it is so undervalued. I’d like to change that.

Two years ago, when I discovered there wasn’t a Guinness World Record for the longest time spent playing a trumpet, something clicked. If I could do something nobody else had done, it might draw attention to the value of the music. I emailed Guinness and applied to be a record-breaker.

At first, I was terrified. The rules alone were overwhelming: I couldn’t repeat a song, so I needed a very long set list. Improvisation wasn’t allowed – no soloing or jamming, only strict melodies. I could only take a five-minute break each hour, but I decided to play nonstop for hours to accumulate a longer break. When I began training, I managed just two hours before my body started to rebel with aches, dizziness and exhaustion. But over months of all-night practice sessions three nights a week, I built up my endurance. Balancing this with my job wasn’t easy. I’d wake at 8am, work through the day, play from 10pm to 6am, then get ready to teach again at 7.30am. Two sleepless nights in a row, and then repeat.

My first official attempt lasted 24 hours and 46 minutes in February 2024 at the school where I teach. Two witnesses and a music specialist adjudicated the attempt from start to finish, swapping every four hours. I was exhausted, in pain, and eventually I was disqualified. The reason? Taking a sip of water between a song outside the permitted time window. I was gutted: none of my previous hours of playing counted. It felt deeply unfair.

At first, I swore I wouldn’t try again. But my students changed my mind. When they heard I’d been disqualified for drinking water, they were outraged. “How dare they do that to Mr Joshua?” they asked. I realised I had an opportunity to model resilience. I could show them setbacks don’t have to be the end. You can always bounce back. So I tried again. On 9 May this year, at 1pm, I started playing at the Terra Kulture culture centre in Lagos.

My lips started bleeding, but I told myself to not stop playing until the very last note

This time, I pushed past everything: the chapped lips, trembling legs, the fatigue. I played classical pieces, Afrobeat songs, jazz and pop that kept the momentum going. I played George Michael’s Careless Whisper, Tyla’s hit single Water, and songs from Nigeria’s beloved Fela Kuti. It was relentless. But I love the trumpet, and that love carried me through.

The audience felt it, too. The hall was full of people, some staying for the whole performance. My manager, Dami, and my colleagues Blake and Kelvin helped with the technical details like lights and timing. The first hours were steady. Around hour five, I felt the burn in my lips and shoulders, but the rhythm kept me going. As time went on, my legs began to shake and my fingers cramped. I had to keep switching between sitting and standing to avoid my body giving out. My lips started bleeding, but I told myself not to stop playing until the very last note. When I finally stopped, I had been playing for 25 hours and 30 minutes straight. It was the best feeling I’ve ever had. I was so excited – not just for myself, but for all the people who helped me pull this off.

Do I want to break another record? Why not? If I can do 25 hours, I can do longer. But the record is just one part of the story. I’ve also got an upcoming Music Empowerment tour across Africa. Music is the tool, but the message is broader: perseverance, discipline, and to dream bigger than your circumstances.

I love music and what it can do – the stories it can tell, the lives it can inspire. Most of all, I love the trumpet with my whole heart.

My strawberry patch – which had been mediocre at best until this season – flourished in those extremely sunny spring days. Not only did we pick more fruit, but the strawberries were larger and sweeter than those of previous years. And even when the fruit had dwindled, the runners – the new plants emerging from the parent plant – just kept coming. They’ve stretched out from their original site, romped into the path and rooted into a neighbour’s bed.

Strawberry plants will produce fruit for a good three to four years and then start to slow down, so when you’ve reached this point it’s a good idea to replant your patch. You can do this with newly bought plants (a wise choice if yours are showing signs of disease or vulnerability) or by relocating the new runners that have appeared this season.

It’s always advisable to move your strawberry patch to a new location if possible to avoid the possibility of disease buildup or the risk of replant disease. This insufficiently understood problem describes how new plants can struggle to grow in soil that previously hosted plants of the same kind. Choose a sunny spot (although strawberries will tolerate some shade) and mulch generously with compost as they like fertile soil that drains well. Having said that, my runners are rooting happily into the fairly dense clay of the veg patch’s paths, so I suspect they’re more formidable than we realise.

Choose the sturdiest, healthiest plants to transplant and dispense with any that show signs of ailing

It’s easy to identify a strawberry plant that’s ready to transplant if you follow the tentacle-like stems to where they’ve touched the ground and a new cluster of jagged-edged leaves is growing. Using a fork, gently ease the plant out of the ground and install it into its new location. Plants can also be potted up into containers filled with compost and placed somewhere sheltered to wait to move to their new home. In fact, strawberries grow well in large containers and benefit from the ripe fruit being kept off the ground as they are susceptible to rot when left in contact with moist soil. Choose the sturdiest, healthiest plants to transplant and dispense with any that show signs of ailing, like deformities or black spots on their leaves.

Strawberry plants are fairly cold-hardy – apart from their flowers and fruit, of course – so doing this job in November is no problem where I live in the south of England. But if the ground where you are has frozen hard, consider putting this job off until early spring. If the winter weather takes a harsh turn, I’ll likely mulch my new strawberry patch with straw to protect the plants as they find their feet. And I’ll be crossing my fingers for a sunny start to next season and another bumper year for strawberries.",2025-11-14T17:36:09.641926

My bones ached at night. I grew out of my clothes at a rapid clip, exposing skinny ankles beneath the bottom of my blue jeans. I went from being average height to towering over everyone in my class.

I had been uncomfortable in my own skin even before that. I grew up in the US in the late 70s, and my body type was not in fashion. I was curvy in places that were not celebrated, with thighs and a butt that announced themselves in ways I found uncomfortable. I was a teen when I first started dieting, and women’s critiques of their bodies, and the bodies of others, quickly became a constant refrain of my youth.

I carried the narrative that my body was faulty and needed to be controlled into adulthood. Until one summer, when I was in my early 30s. I was divorced, and my two children were with their father at his home in Europe for the summer. I worked at a demanding job, and rarely took vacations, but a friend persuaded me to drive with him from my home in Seattle to the Oregon Country Fair. We were recovering alcoholics, and I wasn’t sure about attending a three-day music fair in the middle of nowhere, but I figured we would be fine together – he had been sober longer than I had.

I’m not outdoorsy, but my friend and I set up a tent in the performers’ camping area with his friends, who were acrobats and circus performers. For days we lived in the forest, listening to music and staying up late around a campfire. When they were done with their public shows, the performers joined us, playing their instruments and singing. My friend and I, the only sober ones in the group, smoked lots of cigarettes.

The women were strong, acrobats, uninhibited. Being with them changed me. Food suddenly tasted better. I remember a sunny day, walking down a forest path to a booth that sold granola with berries, and experiencing the warm burst of sweetness in my mouth. My shoulders loosened. I felt my feet connect with the ground in a new way, the smell of the campfire in my hair and clothes. I was a writer, unpublished, working on a novel late at night when my children slept. But this was the first time I had spent an extended period of time with other artists, and it was intoxicating. It was like getting a backstage pass to a kind of heaven I never knew existed.

I remember going to take a shower – there was a private stall, but you had to pay money for it, and everyone used the public showers. I was reluctant, expecting flashbacks to the awkward gym class ablutions of my youth.

Try it, people said. It’s magical.

With some trepidation, I took all my clothes off and walked out on to a large open-air wooden platform. We were surrounded by trees, the blue sky, the warm air. Shower spigots, towers with multiple nozzles, rose from the platform every few feet, and there were so many people – probably 50 of us – all showering without a scrap of clothing in sight. No one seemed self-conscious: the deeply hippy vibe of the festival extended to this space; young, old, every type of body, race, gender. We were just human beings, shorn of the cultural signifiers of clothing, for that moment together in the woods.

I lathered my skin, feeling a deep release. A young man who could not walk was carried by two of his friends, all of them nude, to an open space beneath a spigot. I could see on his face that he felt the same freedom and welcome. His body, too, was just another of the many expressions of being human.

It was a deeply spiritual moment for me, and the start of a spiritual practice of honouring my body as a vehicle for connection, understanding, pleasure and guidance.

I’m 62 now, and that perspective has helped me make peace with the ways in which age changes a body. I no longer diet; I enjoy the burst of sweetness from the raspberries that grow in my garden when I pop them in my mouth in the summer sun. I am grateful that my body can still take me through the water like an arrow, swimming strong and far. I have two young grandchildren and I am hopeful that they will grow up with a different refrain: that our bodies are all different, and that is wonderful.",2025-11-14T17:36:12.043780

Leaving everything he owned behind, the farmer found refuge above Turgeau, one of the few neighbourhoods of Port-au-Prince still beyond the gangs’ reach.

New arrivals to Haiti’s capital climb ever-high to claim a few square metres and throw up a makeshift shelter of planks and rusty corrugated iron. To reach his, Charles scrambles up a steep path. Glasses perched on his head, he gazes across the hills at scattered shacks. “They arrived without warning and burned our crops,” he says. “We ran for our lives. Those who didn’t leave were killed. Two of my brothers were murdered.”

Since January 2022, more than 16,000 Haitians have been killed in gang-related violence. More than 1.4 million people – nearly half of them children – have fled their homes since January 2025, driven by rampant gang violence and climate collapse. Throughout the country, droughts and failed harvests in rural areas are pushing farmers into overcrowded cities, where overstretched infrastructure fails to stem disease and desperation.

Armed groups are thought to control about 90% of Port-au-Prince. In the areas surrounding Haiti’s cities, they are burning crops, killing civilians and forcing families such as Charles’s to abandon their land for makeshift hillside shelters and an uncertain future.

Only a few areas of Pétion-Ville – an outer suburb of Port-au-Prince – still hold out, guarded by self-defence brigades backed up by off-duty volunteer police officers. In Canapé-Vert, residents have erected roadblocks to deter gang incursions. Some are permanent, using abandoned trucks and tipped-over containers, while others are mobile, to screen who comes and goes.

Lano Yves has staffed one such checkpoint for three years. Each night, the barriers seal the neighbourhood from 7pm to 5.30am. He makes no apology for the hard line. “People can think what they like of us, but we’ll defend our neighbourhood to the last drop of our blood. We’re fighting the filthy bandits, the terrorists who threaten us every day.”

Justice is often summary. Vigilante lynchings by the Bwa Kalé movement, in which victims are sometimes burned alive, can await those unable to justify their presence outside curfew hours.

Further towards the city centre, the Champ-de-Mars lies deserted. An armoured police vehicle patrols it; a site too symbolic to cede to the gangs.

The police have also begun using drones to strike armed groups. Since March 2025, the UN has recorded 559 people killed from the air, including 11 children.

A gang led by a man known as Tilapli rules the area around the Grand Cemetery, a few hundred metres from the palace in Champ-de-Mars. Rusting school buses still run, provided passengers pay a “tax” at each checkpoint. Walls bear the scars of combat: bullet strikes and drone shrapnel.

In front of a smashed cemetery wall, armed men collect crumpled bills from passing vehicles into a white bucket. The night before, gun battles with the police – “the cats” – continued until sunrise, edging up to the church bordering the Champ-de-Mars before being forced to fall back.

Elsewhere in the country, another crisis is unfolding quietly. The land can no longer feed those who work it, and farmers migrate to chèche lavi – “seek life”. Haiti ranks among the most climate-vulnerable countries, with longer droughts, violent floods, erratic seasons and devastating hurricanes. The Artibonite plain and Central plateau in the middle of the country crack under the heat. Three consecutive failed harvests have emptied the granaries.

“The land no longer gives,” says Doudou Pierre Festile, coordinator of the Acul-du-Nord Peasant Movement near Cap-Haïtien, about 125 miles (200km) north of Port-au-Prince. “When you can’t feed your children, you leave for the cities; there, ‘another storm’ awaits: overcrowding, soaring prices, hunger.”

At the Villambetta camp in Tabarre, Port-au-Prince, anger and exhaustion prevail. Venel Nelson, the camp’s spokesperson, says: “In Haiti, there’s a spaghetti effect: everything gets tangled. Our leaders have had dealings with the gangs. If they created the problem, they can’t be the solution.”

View image in fullscreen View image in fullscreen Clockwise from main: Venel Nelson and Dorival Magdala, who live in Villambetta cap in Port-au-Prince and Louisanne Javi, who returned to Acul-du-Nord from the capital

Dorival Magdala, a camp resident, says: “It’s hell here. We talk, we live, but in reality we’re already dead.”

Tens of thousands sleep in shelters made from sheet-metal or in requisitioned schools and churches. The rains fail and the soil doesn’t give any more, and the capital becomes a last refuge – and then a dead end.

In Acul-du-Nord, Louisanne Javi recounts leaving first because of drought and then violence. “Ten years ago, a drought destroyed my harvest. I left with my daughter to seek a living in Port-au-Prince,” she says. “Three years ago, the gangsters came. We fled again. We came back here, but we sow, and don’t harvest, because it doesn’t rain.”

From the hills of Port-au-Prince to the shores of Cap-Haïtien, the flight from violence and hunger is remaking Haiti’s landscapes. Land cannot feed, cities bite into the hills, rivers flood and disease spreads. Haiti is besieged not only by armed men, but by erosion, heat and salt. Peace may be measured by the return of rain, living soil and a coastline that stops retreating.

Meanwhile, displacement reshapes society: displaced youths become easy targets for armed groups, coerced or driven by despair. Overwhelmed cities struggle to manage waste collection, water, sanitation and housing.

The population of Cap-Haïtien has surged; hospital officials report a steady rise in patients. Rubbish piles line the shoreline, and newcomers clear hillsides to build or to sell charcoal. The UN Development Programme notes that more than 90% of Haitian households meet their energy needs with charcoal and firewood – a necessity born of poverty, power outages and the lack of alternative energy sources.

Deforestation to produce charcoal clears hillsides, increases erosion and worsens floods. The result is a cycle of environmental and governance failure that many connect to Haiti’s colonial history.

Mangrove initiatives by FoProBiM offer a mitigation strategy, but historical debts and weak governance deepen the cycle of instability. In Haiti, there is a consensus that the indemnity demanded by France in 1825, 150 million francs in gold, bled the public finances from the birth of the first Black republic freed from slavery.

Juslène Tyrésias, of the Papay Peasants Movement, notes that the consequences are still being felt. “Haiti had to cut its trees to pay the ransom,” she says, referring to the debt to France.

Dr Weedjney Destouches, who fled violence in Port-au-Prince several years ago and now runs a network of low-cost clinics from Cap-Haïtien, says the debt has left a legacy of environmental degradation, violent upheavals and weak governance. “The independence ransom remains a central factor in understanding the country’s fragility,” he says.

International interventions have followed one another without lasting success. In 2023, a Kenya-led multinational security mission was approved to assist Haiti’s police in retaking the capital. By 2025, the mission had faltered amid ambushes and scandals. In several neighbourhoods, gangs regained ground.

In the Port-au-Prince cemetery, a gang member watches the city’s turmoil. He says of the Kenyan force: “They came to make a bit of money, not to deal with the security problem.”",2025-11-14T17:36:17.327875

It usually came at dawn, as the mosques sounded the first call to prayer. By the time he sat down for breakfast, it would fill the air around his home in Tadamon, a working-class district in the south-east of Damascus. The smell was hard to define. Whenever he noticed it, Abu Mohammed felt on edge. He had his suspicions about what it might be, but like so many Syrians who lived under the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad, he knew to keep such thoughts to himself.

Abu Mohammed, a retired engineer who asked to be identified only by his nickname, first noticed the smell in the winter of 2012, nearly two years after the start of the uprising against Assad. At the time, he was living in a modest flat in the heart of Tadamon with his wife and their five children. The house stood just off a busy road named Daboul Street. Before the fighting started, Abu Mohammed enjoyed sitting on his balcony after work, sipping his tea as he watched the yellow minicabs and honking motorbikes compete for space in the streets below.

But by the time the smell became noticeable, these streets were largely deserted. The Assad regime had rolled out a network of checkpoints across the neighbourhood in an attempt to quell protests after the 2011 uprising. Hiding behind a curtain so he wouldn’t be seen, Abu Mohammed watched soldiers patrolling the streets. He also noticed white minibuses driving up and down Daboul Street. Whenever the minibuses passed by, he would hear gunfire later that day. Then, overnight, that same smell. One of his daughters, who was in her early teens at the time, remembers it, too. “It smelt like burning hair,” she recalled. “Or like a piece of meat that has been left in a pan until it melts.”

Nearly a decade later, in April 2022, the Guardian published a video that revealed the source of the smell. The footage carried a date tag from April 2013 and was geolocated to Tadamon. It showed two men in military fatigues next to a white minibus. One of the soldiers could be seen pulling a civilian, blindfolded, out of the van and dragging him towards a large pit filled with bodies and car tyres. The other stood by the edge of the pit with an assault rifle. Calmly, he pushed his victim into the pit and executed him as he fell on to the other victims. They did this time after time. When 41 people lay dead, the shooter took a jerrycan of fuel, poured it over the tyres and the bodies, and set the pit on fire with a burning rag attached to a wooden stick.

The footage was part of a collection of videos leaked by a source inside Syria and obtained by two genocide scholars in Amsterdam, Annsar Shahhoud and Uğur Ümit Üngör. The researchers shared a selection of the material with the Guardian and submitted the rest to European war crime prosecutors. In total, the videos document the killing of 288 civilians by Assad’s forces, the academics concluded, including seven women and 12 children.

One of the scholars, Shahhoud, managed to identify the main shooter seen in the video. His name is Amjad Youssef and he served as an officer in Branch 227 of the Assad regime’s military intelligence. Using a fake Facebook account in which she posed as a regime loyalist, Shahhoud sent him a friend request, gained his trust over several phone calls, and lured him into confessing his crimes. When she confronted him with the video, he replied: “I am proud of my deeds.”

As long as Assad was still in power, no one in Tadamon dared to mention the video in public. According to Abu Mohammed, Youssef remained in the neighbourhood after the video was published, as if nothing had happened. “He would just drive up and down the street on his motorbike. No one would say anything.”

But now that the dictator is gone, the people of Tadamon are breaking their silence. As they have begun to share their stories, it is becoming clear that the atrocities in the neighbourhood were far worse than initially reported – and involved many more perpetrators besides Youssef.

Between March and August this year, I visited Tadamon multiple times and spoke with more than 20 residents. Abu Mohammed, a short elderly man with a soft smile, was one of the first people I met. As soon as he noticed me in the street, he grabbed my arm. “I stayed here throughout the war,” he said. “If you want to know what really happened here, follow me.”

We sat in the family living room, and Abu Mohammed’s wife served cardamom coffee and sweets as the father and daughter recalled the moment they first saw the video on social media. “We immediately made the connection,” the daughter said. “This was the gunfire we used to hear, and it explained the smell. We even recognised some of the victims. They were people we saw regularly on the streets.”

The video captures only a fraction of the slaughter Assad’s forces unleashed upon Tadamon, Abu Mohammed said. To him and many other residents I spoke to, the killing of civilians in Tadamon was not a single event. For years, he said, he saw the minibuses drive up and down the street, sometimes as often as two or three times a week. The smell of burning bodies, he and his daughter recalled, kept returning, too, from the very end of 2012 until at least 2015. Random killings and arrests continued long after. Assad’s forces may have killed not hundreds of civilians in Tadamon, but thousands.

Nearly a year after Assad’s fall, the people of Tadamon have seen very little justice for these crimes. While Youssef is widely rumoured to have fled the country, many other perpetrators are still in the neighbourhood. “We don’t feel safe,” an elderly man named Ghassan, who lost his brother in the massacres, told me. “I can walk down the street here and shake someone’s hand, and that same person might be the one who killed my brother.”

Abu Mohammed took me on a tour of the neighbourhood. We started on Daboul Street, which divides the district into two parts. To its west is a labyrinth of narrow alleyways that still buzz with life. Here, children chase each other with toy guns, street vendors push wooden carts stacked with fresh fruit and neighbours argue with one another from their balconies. To its east lies a wasteland filled with piles of rubble and the ruins of bombed out apartment blocks.

“This is where the smell came from,” Abu Mohammed said as he stepped into the ruined area. He took me to the spot near Daboul street where the executions were filmed. The children playing in the rubble began re-enacting the massacre as soon as they noticed me. “This is how he killed him!” one 10-year-old boy shouted, waving his imaginary rifle. “I saw it myself on YouTube.”

“There are many more mass graves in this area,” Abu Mohammed said as he took me deeper into the wasteland, an area the size of more than 50 football fields. Inside one destroyed building, he showed me a shallow crater filled with human bones, including a skull, bits of a spine and smaller bones which may have belonged to children. As we stood there, some stray dogs howled in the distance. “Those dogs keep digging up bones,” the elderly man said. “That’s how many mass graves were found.”

On the first floor of another building nearby, we saw a metal bar hanging from the ceiling of a room with pink walls covered in graffiti left by Assad’s forces. We spoke to a man holding his young son by the hand, who told us he used to live here until the regime took his house and turned it into a torture site. “They would hang people from that metal bar and cut their wrists,” he said. Many of the people killed here, Abu Mohammed said, were simply dumped in the wasteland below or stacked into empty buildings which were subsequently bombed. “That’s how they hid the evidence,” he said, pointing at the piles of rubble around him. Since there has been no effort yet to exhume this area, many relatives of the victims still have no idea what happened to their loved ones, let alone a grave to mourn them.

As we returned to Daboul Street, Abu Mohammed showed me a last location which he said played a crucial part in the regime’s killing machine: a small mosque with a bullet-riddled minaret. The Othman bin Affan mosque stands on the border between the parts of Tadamon that are still intact and the rubble beyond. “This is where the minibuses drove to,” he said. “When I passed it one day in 2014 with my nine-year-old daughter, we saw piles of corpses lying outside.”

The caretaker of the mosque is Naji, a slender elderly man with a long beard. He took me down to the basement, which he said was used as a torture site. Some bones still lay on the floor. “After the liberation we found a noose hanging from the ceiling,” the old man said, shaking his head. “How could they do such a thing in the house of God?”

It was in front of this same mosque that Malek Moustafa first climbed on to the shoulders of his friend, on 25 April 2011, to demand the fall of the regime. The imam had called for a protest in solidarity with the people of Daraa, a city in the south of Syria, where Assad’s security forces had tortured a group of young people for writing “freedom” and “down with the regime” on the walls of a school.

“Something came out of me that day that never went back inside,” Moustafa, 43, told me in July, in a small one-room building in the heart of Tadamon, where he sat chain smoking red Gauloises. On that spring day in 2011, he had just turned 29. He was not particularly political nor religious. He spent many of his nights going out with his friends, who were not just Sunni Muslims like himself, but also Alawites, Christians, Druzes and Ismailis. “At the time, we didn’t care much what sect people belonged to,” he said.

According to Moustafa, that sense of community across different sects was typical of the Tadamon of his childhood. Sometimes referred to as “little Syria”, the neighbourhood is home to practically all of Syria’s ethnic and religious groups. In Arabic, its name means “solidarity”, a reference to the welcome this district provided to Syrians displaced from the Golan Heights following Israel’s illegal occupation of the area in 1967.

But that old solidarity was about to fracture. As Moustafa and other protesters gathered in front of the mosque in 2011, they were beaten up by a group of “shabiha”. This derogatory term, which literally translates as “ghosts”, refers to regime loyalists, mainly Alawites, who received money and favours from the intelligence services to crush dissent. One man who played a crucial role in mobilising the shabiha was a local Alawite, then in his mid-30s, who everyone in Tadamon still talks about. His real name is Fadi Ahmad, but he is better known as Fadi “Saqr” – Fadi the Falcon. According to Moustafa and other residents, Saqr set up so-called “popular committees”, groups of shabiha who were given weapons and salaries to attack the protesters. As the demonstrations continued, the activist was shocked to see some of his friends sign up.

“These were the same people I used to play football with. One of them was one of my best friends, we even used to pray together,” said Moustafa. “But when I ran into him shortly after the revolution began, he asked me: ‘If we meet in battle one day, would you ever kill me?’ I answered: ‘Of course not.’ And then he said: ‘I would kill you.’”

To organise themselves, Moustafa and his friends set up an activist network named the Tadamon Coordination Committee. After a regime sniper killed an 11-year-old boy at a demonstration, the activists also began to pick up arms, and were joined by defectors from the army and police. Street-to-street fighting followed, and by early 2012, much of Tadamon was under rebel control.

The district was of key strategic importance. It is located next to crucial highways and serves as a gateway to Damascus’s southern countryside, where the rebels had become a serious force. To its west lies the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk, another rebel stronghold. To prevent these fronts from linking up and halt the rebel advance from the south, the regime had to win Tadamon back. In the summer of 2012, it launched a major counteroffensive.

Moustafa said he was not a fighter at the time, but was constantly with the rebels, helping provide them with weapons and medical supplies. In one heavy battle in early August, he was standing right behind his brother Bilal when a regime sniper killed him. Moustafa buried him close to the Othman bin Affan mosque, wrapped in a flag of the Syrian revolution which Bilal, a tailor, had sewn himself.

Aside from the army, Assad also sent the shabiha into battle. From mid-2012, onwards, they were incorporated into a paramilitary force called the National Defence Force (NDF). Fadi Saqr helped set up the NDF in Tadamon and later became its commander in all of Damascus. He also joined the battlefield himself: in November 2012, he appeared in a regime propaganda video on YouTube, surrounded by soldiers and a tank firing into Tadamon’s narrow alleyways.

That same month, Moustafa was arrested. He and his friend Mohammed were on their way to Yarmouk, but ran into a checkpoint and were taken to Branch 235 of Assad’s military intelligence, one of the most notorious torture prisons in the country. “We were tortured there for eight months,” Moustafa said. “I could hear Mohammed’s screams echo through the building.”

Moustafa was released in June 2013 as part of a prisoner swap. Since Tadamon was by now under regime control, he joined rebel forces south of the neighbourhood. He would remain there until 2018, when the rebels lost their territory and withdrew to the north-western province of Idlib.

From a distance, Moustafa noticed black smoke rising above Tadamon and smelled something strange. “The men stationed on the frontline could even hear screaming and the sounds of bullets,” he said. “It didn’t make any sense to us, because the regime was in full control of that area. Only later it became clear to us that the regime was carrying out an ethnic cleansing against the Sunnis in the area.”

Many civilians fled Tadamon, but Abu Mohammed decided to stay. Though a Sunni himself, he said his job as an engineer at a public utilities company and the ID that went with it gave him relative leeway at checkpoints. In any case, he had already had his share of displacement in life. “I was seven years old when Israel invaded my home on the Golan Heights,” he said. After that experience, he refused to become a refugee again.

The neighbourhood was now ruled by a mix of NDF members, regular soldiers and members of Branch 227 of the military intelligence. Most of the NDF members, Abu Mohammed said, were the type of guys you would want to avoid even before the uprising. Some used to work as bouncers in casinos, others were drug dealers or had spent time in prison. To these men, the NDF was a route to the power they had long craved.

During these years, Abu Mohammed’s family tried to stay at home as much as possible and the children were not allowed to play outside. But one of their teenage sons would sometimes go missing all day and only come back late in the evening. One time, his mother noticed a footprint on his back, as if he had been kicked. “He told me the NDF had taken him to build a dirt wall,” his mother told me in March. “He was very scared and didn’t dare to talk about it.”

When I returned to see Abu Mohammed’s family in late May, this son was visiting his family for Eid. He is now in his early 30s and it was his first time back in Tadamon since he fled Syria in 2015 and crossed the Mediterranean in a dinghy to reach Europe. Abu Mohammed and I were talking in the living room as he entered and sat down next to his father. When I explained the topic of our conversation, the young man looked nervous, but soon joined us and began to reveal his secret. To protect his identity, he asked to be identified as Ahmed.

The paramilitaries of the NDF would take him in the morning, Ahmed said. Usually, they grabbed him at the bus stop on his way to high school. First, they would confiscate his phone and ID to make sure he couldn’t escape, take pictures or contact anyone. Then, they took him and other boys and young men they’d pulled off the streets to various parts of Tadamon and neighbouring districts, where they put them to work. Mostly, they were forced to fill sandbags at checkpoints or strip electricity cables from destroyed buildings so the copper inside could be sold. But on two occasions, the task was much more extreme.

“We were forced to burn bodies,” Ahmed said softly. He paused and looked at his father, who kept his eyes fixed on his son. Ahmed took a slow breath and went on to describe exactly what happened.

He was taken to the Othman bin Affan mosque just off Daboul Street, the one that was used as a torture facility. Outside on the street lay the bodies of at least 20 men and women. Many of them carried marks of severe beatings. “Our job,” Ahmed said, “was to take the bodies to the other side of the main street, where there were a lot of demolished buildings and rubble. There we would stack them inside an empty building, close it off, and set the place on fire. By the time I came home, I could smell the burning bodies.”

As he listened to his son, Abu Mohammed nodded, as if things were finally falling into place. But when I asked him if he knew, he shook his head. “We would go crazy looking for him on those days,” he said, somewhat apologetically. “We understood something was going on, because he was extremely stressed when he came home, as if he was about to explode. But this is the first time I’ve heard all the details.”

Ahmed looked uneasy. “I could not tell anyone,” he replied to his father. “The regime would have hurt us.” Even after escaping to Europe (he asked me not to name the country), he still didn’t dare to talk about his experiences. “People in Europe wouldn’t understand, anyway,” he said. “They helped us a lot, but to them, we are just refugees who fled some kind of war. They don’t know the details of what the regime did to Syrians.”

When Assad was toppled on 8 December 2024, Malek Moustafa was on his way home. During his six years of displacement in Idlib, he said, he had spent much time fantasising about taking revenge against the shabiha who ruined his life. Now, the moment had come. “As a victorious man I thought to myself: I will kill the first shabih I see with my bare hands,” Moustafa said.

But when he reached Tadamon the day after Assad’s fall, the opposite happened. As he walked through the bombed-out streets of his childhood, he bumped into a former regime fighter. “I first didn’t recognise him, but when I came closer, I saw it was someone who had joined the NDF from the start,” Moustafa said. “Before I could say anything, he said: Welcome, you hero, congratulations on winning the battle!”

Moustafa froze for a moment. He knew that Ahmed al-Sharaa, the rebel commander and now Syria’s president, had ordered the rebels not to take revenge against any regime forces who surrendered. As he stood there considering what to do, something happened that he never believed was possible. “He hugged me, and I hugged him back,” the activist said with a smile. “We even kissed on the cheeks. I know it sounds strange, but in that moment, I just felt all the hatred and vengeance go away. I felt peace.”

His story is no exception. By all accounts, no blood was shed in Tadamon in the wake of Assad’s fall. Former NDF members simply fled or put down their arms, and some were even seen tearing down Assad portraits. The rebels collected the former regime soldiers’ weapons, but stuck to Sharaa’s orders and refrained from revenge killings – to the surprise of many residents. “We expected them to storm our homes and slaughter us,” one 21-year-old Alawite shopkeeper named Hadi told me. “But that didn’t happen. Many people who used to be with the NDF even stayed in the neighbourhood. Nothing bad happened to them.”

Shortly after the liberation, Moustafa and a few activist friends relaunched the work of the Tadamon Coordination Committee, the activist network founded in 2011. The small one-room building in which he received me serves as their office. On the wall hung a large banner with the group’s logo, a clutched fist in the colours of the Syrian revolution flag, today Syria’s official flag. “It hasn’t changed since 2011,” Moustafa said proudly. “I think 90% of our original members have been martyred, but our group has survived.”

The activists distribute bread in the neighbourhood, run a Facebook group that is the go-to news source for many residents, and are working on a podcast series on the history and future of Tadamon. They also work closely with the local head of the new general security forces, who is an old friend from the early days of the revolution. When I visited the office, there was a pile of boxes with surveillance cameras lying on the floor which the group was about to install throughout the neighbourhood. “We are building a country now,” Moustafa said. “So we have to think with a government mentality rather than a revolution mentality.”

So far, only a handful of people have been arrested for suspected involvement in the mass atrocities in Tadamon, media reports indicate. The local head of the general security forces did not provide me with an exact figure, but acknowledged “it’s a very small number in comparison to the crimes”. Moustafa argued this is understandable in a transitional period. “To achieve justice, we need to first get rid of the chaos,” he said. “These things take time.”

But not everyone in Tadamon is so patient. Many residents find the apparent impunity of Assad’s former henchmen hard to stomach. Above all, their anger has become directed against one man: Fadi Saqr.

Instead of facing trial for his role as an NDF commander, “the Falcon” has started working with Sharaa’s government. Last February, Saqr visited the neighbourhood under security escort, reportedly to help the government negotiate with other former regime loyalists about handing over weapons. The following day, hundreds of people in Tadamon took to the streets to protest at Saqr’s appearance and hung an effigy of him from a makeshift gallows. A week later, in what seemed an attempt to assuage public outrage, the authorities arrested three men accused of involvement in atrocities in the neighbourhood.

Following the anti-Alawite massacres along the Syrian coast last March, the government established a so-called civil peace committee with the stated aim of “strengthening national unity”. Sources familiar with the committee’s activities told me Saqr has helped the government to disarm former regime affiliates, secured the release of government security personnel taken hostage along the Syrian coast, and used his contacts with former regime figures to strike deals on behalf of the new government.

Last June, it was reported that Saqr was involved in the release of previously detained former regime officers. In response to the public outrage that followed, the government gave a press conference in which Hassan Soufan, a member of the civil peace committee, said the released officers did not commit violations against civilians and defended the committee’s collaboration with Saqr. “We understand the anger and the pain felt by the families of the martyrs and victims,” Soufan told reporters. “But in this phase of civil peace, we are sometimes forced to make decisions to avoid more violent explosions and to secure relative stability necessary for the coming stage.” Soufan hinted that the former NDF commander contributed to the liberation of Damascus by coordinating with Sharaa’s forces and he emphasised Saqr’s importance to “untangling knots, solving problems and facing dangers that the country is exposed to”. At the moment, Soufan indicated, there are no plans to prosecute Saqr or revoke his security protection.

In a statement to the New York Times straight after the press conference, Saqr himself denied responsibility for the Tadamon massacre, claiming he was appointed to lead the NDF only after the massacre seen in the April 2013 video. “If the ministry of interior had any evidence against me, I wouldn’t be working with them today,” he said. (The ministry of interior has been contacted for comment.)

In Tadamon, the press conference and Saqr’s statement have only stoked public anger. “Whenever Fadi Saqr makes an appearance, it ignites this neighbourhood,” the local general security chief Abu Abdelrahman told me in his office last August. Though he made sure not to overtly criticise the government’s dealings with the former NDF boss, he also said that even if he was formally appointed to lead the militia after the April 2013 killings, “massacres happened after Fadi Saqr took charge”.

After the relative calm in the wake of Assad’s fall, the security situation in Tadamon has deteriorated since Saqr made an appearance, Abdelrahman said. A few weeks after the press conference, a man accused of having worked as Saqr’s bodyguard was shot dead in the street, and several revenge killings against suspected former NDF members have followed. “We are in a hurry and are applying pressure on the government to punish the criminals,” he said. The longer the impunity lasts, he warned, the more difficult it becomes for him to dissuade locals from taking revenge. “Is it really natural for a person who sees his brother’s killer or sister’s rapist right in front of him not to act? He might be patient once, twice, multiple times. But in the end, he will act.”

Today in Tadamon, there are simmering conflicts between neighbours that may still erupt into violence. In a dead end street close to Abu Mohammed’s house, I met one elderly couple who told me about their apprehensions. When the war started, they said, their four sons joined the NDF “out of fear”, but they were all killed by the regime’s own forces after conflicts with their superiors. “Now we have to take care of our grandchildren,” the woman said, as some of the young children ran around the living room.

With Assad gone, the family has been receiving threats. On one occasion, a group of men stormed into the home and tore the portraits of the sons from the wall. “After that I burned all of my son’s portraits,” said the old woman, as she started to sob. “People used to be so nice to me. Before 8 December my neighbours kissed me on my forehead when they saw me. They called me the mother of the martyrs. But after 8 December, nobody talks to me.”

I told Abu Mohammed about my encounter with the woman. “The tears of a whore,” he said, bitterly. According to him and several other residents I interviewed, the old woman used to denounce her neighbours to the authorities and plundered the homes of those who got arrested or fled. “I would see her with a cart full of furniture when I left home in the morning,” said Abu Mohammed. “The family even ran a shop where they sold the booty. Nobody dared to ask where they got it from.”

What will happen to this family now? Abu Mohammed showed me a Facebook post by a friend who lost his relatives in the massacres. “Why are they still in the neighbourhood?” the man had written. “Why are the security forces protecting them? If our martyrs are not considered part of the revolution […] we must act.” To leave no doubt as to what his aim is, the man included the family’s full address in his post.

“People have vengeance in their hearts,” Abu Mohammed said as he put down his phone. “I personally still trust that President Sharaa will bring us justice, because he is one of us. But if he doesn’t, I’m sure that the men in the neighbourhood will take care of this.”",2025-11-14T17:36:19.218603
c834c8bde8bdc43b593fe53fa3a6786bf99b0482,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/13/rise-older-renters-housing-crisis-home-ownership,The rapid rise of renters in their 60s: ‘I hate the idea of house-sharing – but I have no choice’,"Thu, 13 Nov 2025 05:00:14 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss,"Now that she is retired, Deborah Herring’s days are hers to fill – usually with leisurely walks, museums and trips to the theatre. But she still manages to spare a thought for her ex-colleagues at the private boarding school where she taught religious studies for 14 years. “In their nice, expensive Oxfordshire village, I think they’d be frankly horrified about my situation,” she says with a laugh.

Horrified that a few weeks ago she came home to find two strangers asleep on her sofa; horrified that she has to put up with an overflowing litter tray belonging to a cat that isn’t hers; above all, horrified that at the age of 65, she is about to leave a two-bedroom flatshare to move into a four-bedroom one where she will “probably be living with people whose combined age is less than my own”.

Herring initially made the move to flatsharing two years ago, when, fed up with living alone in a rented house near Banbury, she moved to London and into her current place, which she shares with a thirtysomething couple. “I would rather do anything than live out the rest of my life in the country, where there’s barely one bus an hour,” she says. Now, after a period of feeling “slightly like a third wheel”, she is moving into a mixed-use block of flats in Bermondsey, south London.

“I’m not going to have an elegant garden, and drink cocktails and have barbecues on my patio,” says Herring. Rather, she will share a kitchen with strangers, wait for twentysomethings to empty the washing machine, and try to find common ground with people who don’t remember a time before the internet. “It doesn’t actually bother me. I’ve got five children, so I don’t have a problem with young people,” says Herring, who has twice been married. Her teacher’s pension, coupled with a small income as a part-time A-level examiner, is enough to cover £1,000 a month in rent, plus the odd theatre ticket. “You’ve got to think about it as the chance to do something new and different – not as a comedown in the world,” she says.

If it sounds like a less-than-ideal setup for a pensioner, many more of us will soon have to adopt Herring’s attitude. According to the English Housing Survey, just 6% of households headed by someone over 65 are privately renting. But the Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) forecasts that this will almost treble to 17% by 2040. Online rental platform SpareRoom says that the era of flatsharing in later life may already be upon us: just 2.7% of its users were aged over 55 a decade ago, compared to 7.1% in 2024.

The proportion of over-65s in the private rental sector has remained relatively unchanged in the past two decades – largely, says Anna Brain, a senior policy researcher for the PPI, due to the introduction of Margaret Thatcher’s right-to-buy policy in 1980. Among the over-65s, “we’re not seeing a huge increase in private renting yet, because a lot of those people had the opportunity to buy their home in the 80s and 90s,” she says.

Many of these homes were not replaced with fresh council housing stock, leading to a lack in provision of socially rented properties. And yet today, more than 40% of the homes sold under the scheme are privately rented.

“The challenges that younger people face getting on the housing ladder have really significant long-term implications,” says Brain. “Behind that [right-to-buy] group, you have a whole cohort of people coming through who couldn’t get social housing, didn’t have the right to buy, and then were faced with rising house prices.” In short, many more of us will have to make peace with renting into our twilight years. It’s unclear, though, how many of us could afford it.

Andreas Savva, 68, pays £800 a month for a mould-ridden house in east London, which belonged to a friend’s mother. Savva’s ankylosing spondylitis – an inflammatory condition affecting the spine – makes his job in patient transport for a cancer charity increasingly difficult. “I can’t do the patients, so at the minute, I just move the vehicles around,” he says. The mould at home is exacerbating things: “It’s too toxic – it’s beginning to affect my lungs. I have to leave,” he says.

Savva used to live rent-free in a house belonging to his brother, but he had to move out when his brother died without a life insurance policy. He was forced into a series of precarious living situations – first in a hotel, where he paid through the nose for a room, and then in his current place, where the smell of mould soaks into his laundry and garlands the kitchen walls.

Now, the problem is that with a budget of £800 in a city where the monthly price of a one-bed routinely tops £1,300, he is unsure of where exactly he can go. “I hate the idea of sharing,” says Savva. “I hate the idea of a place where there are so many people using the toilet and the kitchen. But I’ve got no choice.”

“I should be retired, but I’m paying rent,” he says. “I need to keep working.” Though he has a small state pension and some money put aside, Cyprus-born Savva doubts he can stay in the UK. “I can’t just keep going on like this for ever,” he says.

Even dedicated savers are unlikely to be putting aside enough money to allow for rent or mortgage payments in retirement. “The UK pension system is based on the assumption that people reach retirement without housing costs,” says Brain. “There’s a huge concern that people aren’t saving enough.” The PPI conservatively estimates that you would need about £180,000 more in your pension pot to cover the cost of renting a one-bedroom flat through later life. “Generally, the people who we find in rented homes over 40 are not high-income households. So to be able to pay their rent today and set aside enough to pay their rent in retirement is going to be incredibly difficult,” she adds.

That’s assuming they find somewhere to rent in the first place. These days, 63-year-old Tamara Kocsubej spends an inordinate amount of time checking her SpareRoom account to see if anyone has responded to her pleas for a decent room in shared accommodation. “I’m checking it all day, every day,” says the Ukraine-born charity worker, who has rented in Nottingham and London since moving to the UK from Hungary.

Her recent stint as a lodger came to an end after just under a month of renting from a live-in landlord, where she felt “unwelcome all the time”. So she took a room in a three-person Airbnb for £950 a month. Before that, she rented a room in a six-bedroom house in north London, which soured when her twentysomething flatmates began to make comments about her age. “At the end of every day, I didn’t want to go back,” she says. “I never used to live with a closed door. Now, I close my door all the time.

“I actually like living with someone,” says Kocsubej. “I don’t want to live alone. But everywhere I look, people are in their 20s.” Many of them, she says, won’t even consider sharing with a 63-year-old. “I want to stay somewhere. I want to be part of the community. It’s making me wonder whether I should go back to Hungary. But all of my life is here.” Last she checked, she was number 146 on one non-profit’s waiting list for affordable housing. “Every day I check and I wait. That’s all I can do,” she says.

The UK housing sector could hardly be less prepared for an influx of older renters. Just 12% of households in England headed by someone over the age of 75 have step-free access to their home. A report published earlier this week by Age UK reported a huge shortage of housing suitable for an ageing population, finding that 44% of over-50s are worried about accessibility.

“When people talk about older people’s housing, they very often think of supported living,” says Age UK’s Lisabel Miles. “Actually, the vast majority of older people will be living in mainstream homes – not in some kind of specialist unit. And the vast majority of people will move when they’re younger and then age in that home.” The problem is that many existing properties are difficult to adapt – whether they contain plumbing that makes it hard for a bath to be replaced with a shower, or stairs that can’t accommodate a stairlift. Applying for a disabled facilities grant to cover the cost of adaptations is slow: on average, it takes 247 working days to get such a grant approved and the work completed. Then there’s the time that private renters may well have to expend on convincing their landlord to make the changes in the first place. “I’m desperate to find somewhere, but I’ve had to turn down rooms where the stairs just weren’t doable,” says Savva.

Of course, there are social advantages to housesharing in later life. Digital marketer Nick Henley founded Cohabitas, an accommodation-sharing site for over-40s, when his father died and his mother was left alone in a three-bedroom house. “She was lonely,” says Henley. “She would ride the buses just to talk to people.” Though his mother quickly dismissed the idea of living with other people in her mid-70s (and never did actually end up sharing), he launched the site anyway, and says that today business has never been better, as a result of rent hikes, rising utility bills and a desire for connection. “The oldest person I’ve ever helped find a flatmate was probably 88,” he says. He admits that if given the choice, most people wouldn’t choose to share a house with strangers, but adds: “Many people would love to live in a flat with a friend, a partner or a family. They would not like to live in a flat on their own.”

Herring supports this hypothesis: “It’s just nice knowing there are bodies around,” she says. “I’ve been surrounded by people all my life. It would be weird to now suddenly be living alone.”

A flat of her own is all that Sarah (not her real name), a 55-year-old paralegal, has ever wanted. Despite being employed for the past 21 years, the self-described “veteran renter” from Surrey could never afford to buy. “There’s an assumption made that when you are a certain age, you are mortgaged, you’re married, you’ve got kids,” she says. “There’s a lot of ageism when you go to view places. It’s like a job interview or dating. I don’t want to be doing this at my age.”

After 12 years in a beloved bedsit – “it wasn’t much,” she says, “but it was mine, where I could do whatever I want, whenever I want” – she was tossed into the SpareRoom arena a few months ago when her landlord wanted the house back for her own family. After years of paying £500 a month for a flat with no central heating or washing machine, she realised she could probably never again afford to live alone.

The flat hunt was brutal: months of messages, interviews and bruising disappointments. Each time she thought she’d found somewhere she might like to live, an email along the lines of “we just don’t think you’re suitable” would land in her inbox. “They may as well have said, ‘You’re too old.’ But what do they think a 55-year-old is going to do? Suddenly keel over and have a heart attack? It was upsetting, quite frankly,” she says.

With a decade still to go until she reaches state pension age, she’s uncertain about whether she could stop working. A few weeks ago she found a room via a care-and-share scheme, offering companionship and light help to a woman in her 80s in exchange for affordable rent. “It’s fine,” she says. “I get to live with some dignity here. But then I remember that, again, I’ll eventually have to leave.”",2025-11-14T17:36:21.805135

A study this month from King’s College London and Ipsos found that 84 percent of people now say the UK feels divided, up from 74 percent in 2020.

Polling on voter intention shows a fracturing of the political landscape as people abandon two-party politics – with Reform now averaging 31 percent, Labour 18 percent, the Conservatives 16 percent, Green Party 14 percent and Liberal Democrats 12 percent.

As the year draws to a close, Guardian Live invites you to a special event with columnist Tim Dowling, film and TV writer Stuart Heritage, and cook and author Meera Sodha. They will join comedian, broadcaster, and occasional Guardian contributor Nish Kumar for an evening of sharp observations, seasonal reflections and behind-the-scenes stories from the Guardian.

Georgina Lawton will also host a special live version of the wildly popular Guardian column You be the judge.

As ever, we want you, our readers, to be part of the event.

The two-seater, single-engine Cessna 172 was removed in a late night operation after dismantling its wings and draining the fuel. Prior to shifting the damaged aircraft, a senior official from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) from Chennai examined it on Thursday night. The aircraft belongs to a private training organisation operating from Salem. A team from the private training organisation came to the spot to make arrangements to move the aircraft, which had its propeller and front portion damaged in the incident.

A crane was brought to the spot to lift the aircraft and carefully placed on a trailer lorry. After a lengthy late night operation that was carried out in the presence of a team of police personnel, firefighters and revenue officials, the aircraft was transported by road to Salem, said airport sources.

The sources further said the Tiruchi airport authorities had provided the recordings, containing the conversation between the pilot and Air Traffic Control, to the DGCA officials. The aircraft was on a training mission and was returning back to Salem from Karaikudi overflying Tiruchi, when the pilot contacted Air Traffic Control and requested a full-scale emergency landing after an “engine failure”.

Non-Danish citizens and foreign companies will only be allowed to buy property or land-use rights if they have been permanent residents and paid all their taxes in Greenland for the previous two years.

Stalin on Friday slammed the AIADMK for filing a petition in the Supreme Court supporting the Election Commission of India’s (EC) ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of voter rolls. He said this was shameful.

Addressing a meeting of party’s booth agents in his Kolathur Assembly constituency in Chennai, Mr. Stalin said the DMK cadre had to do more than just ensure the party’s victory in next year’s Assembly election. “Usually, during election, we entrust you with the responsibility of ensuring the party’s victory. But this time, an additional responsibility has been placed on you — to protect the people’s right to vote,” he said, adding, “From November 4 to December 4, only one month has been allotted for the process. Within that month, every voter’s application form — the form used to enrol oneself as a voter — must be completed.”

Criticising the AIADMK, Mr. Stalin said the party was not functioning like an ‘Opposition party’ and warned it could soon wither away and not even exist as a ‘splinter party’. “They have taken their party to Delhi, pledged it there, accepted all the conditions imposed for SIR and are supporting it. While all other parties across the country are going to the Supreme Court, opposing the SIR, the AIADMK here is going to there in support of it. This is a national disgrace,” he remarked.

Pointing out that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had been raising several allegations regarding ‘Vote Theft’ with evidence, Mr. Stalin said, “Not even a single genuine voter should be excluded from the voter rolls. That is why the DMK has gone to court. We are raising the issue in the people’s forums as well. Already on October 27, the DMK invited leaders of our friendly alliance parties for a meeting and gave several suggestions. Following that, on November 2, we conducted an all-party meeting in Tamil Nadu — inviting every registered party without any discrimination, even including those who oppose or criticise us.” He said speaking about SIR had become unavoidable and that the EC had forced everyone to “prove that we were Indian citizens”.

He added: “The EC has placed this huge burden on us. It has created a situation where people’s voting rights themselves are at risk. You know very well who created such a situation — the Union government.”

‘DMK sabotaging SIR’

Speaking to reporters at Salem Airport, AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K. Palaniswami said the DMK and its alliance opposed the SIR because dead voters’ names were not removed for many years. He contended that for 21 years, the SIR was not done, leaving thousands of dead, shifted, and fake voters’ names on the voter list. He also alleged that the SIR in several places, including Chennai, was progressing slowly due to interference from the DMK. He also charged many officials of working against SIR on alleged oral instructions from the DMK.

Stating that there was no confusion in the enumeration forms, Mr. Palaniswami said that to fill the forms, qualified Booth Level Officers (BLOs) should be appointed. The District Election Officers were not working properly and had not appointed qualified BLOs, he alleged

“Many times, the AIADMK took up the issues of fake voters to the District Election Officers concerned but no action was taken. Due to this, the AIADMK moved to court and removed 31,000 names from the voter list in R.K. Nagar constituency and 10,000 names from the voter list in Karur constituency. In Chennai, in every constituency, around 50,000 dead or fake voters’ names are in the voter list,” he alleged.",2025-11-14T17:38:45.546656

Mr. Yadav finished third, losing by a margin of 51,938 votes. Sanjay Kumar Singh of the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) won the seat by a margin of 44,997 votes, defeating sitting RJD MLA Mukesh Kumar Raushan.

After being expelled from the RJD, Mr. Yadav, who had won the Hasanpur Assembly seat in 2020, formed his own party, the Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD), and contested the election under its banner. He had earlier won the Mahua seat in 2015.

Among Ministers, Sumit Kumar Singh lost in the Chakai Assembly constituency to RJD nominee Savitri Devi by a margin of 12,972 votes. Mr. Singh had won the seat in 2020 as an Independent.

The Congress suffered major setbacks, with Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan losing in Kadwa by 18,368 votes to JD(U) candidate Dulal Chandra Goswami. Bihar Congress president Rajesh Kumar was defeated in the Kutumba Assembly seat by Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) candidate Lalan Ram by 21,525 votes.

Both Deputy Chief Ministers of Bihar, Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha, who contested from Tarapur and Lakhisarai respectively, won their seats. Mr. Choudhary had last contested an Assembly election in 2010 and has since been a member of the Bihar Legislative Council.

Among prominent faces, Bhojpuri actor-singer Khesari Lal Yadav and Ritesh Kumar Pandey lost in their respective constituencies. Mr. Yadav contested on an RJD ticket, while Mr. Pandey was fielded by the Jan Suraaj Party (JSP), which failed to win a single seat in its first electoral outing.

However, folk singer Maithili Thakur secured a victory and became the youngest MLA in Bihar, winning from the Alinagar Assembly seat.

BJP leader Mangal Pandey won the Siwan Assembly seat, defeating sitting MLA and former Speaker Awadh Bihari Choudhary.

In Siwan district, Osama Shahab, son of the late don-turned-politician Mohammad Shahabuddin, won the Raghunathpur seat by defeating JD(U) candidate Vikas Kumar Singh by 9,248 votes. This marks the first electoral win for a member of the Shahabuddin family in more than two decades.

Hena Shahab, wife of the former MP, has previously contested four Lok Sabha elections unsuccessfully — three on an RJD ticket and the last as an Independent after being denied a nomination.

YouTuber Manish Kashyap, contesting on a JSP ticket for the Chanpatia Assembly seat, also lost, finishing third. Congress candidate Abhishek Ranjan won the seat, defeating BJP candidate Umakant Singh.

Former Assam-cadre IPS officer Anand Mishra, who contested the 2024 Lok Sabha election as an Independent, won the Buxar seat as the BJP candidate, defeating sitting Congress MLA Sanjay Tiwari alias Munna Tiwari by 28,353 votes.

BJP leader Ram Kripal Yadav, who had lost the 2024 Lok Sabha election, won the Danapur seat by defeating sitting RJD MLA Reet Lal Yadav.

Jyoti Singh, wife of Bhojpuri actor-singer Pawan Singh, lost the election from Karakat as an Independent. Mr. Singh had joined the BJP weeks before the Assembly election.

It also charted a road map to reduce the pendency.

The bench of Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice NJ Jamadar was handed a document by Public Prosecutor Mankunwar Deshmukh, which showed that there were 478 pending cases against MPs and MLAs and that in at least 132 cases, the courts were yet to secure the presence of the accused.

In at least 45 cases, the courts were busy hearing other applications, and in 144 cases, the stage of trial was of recording evidence. In about 32 cases, arguments are going on.

Further, the bench saw that there were at least 16 cases that had been stayed by the High Court and five by the district courts. The bench asked Deshmukh what the state was planning to do to get the stay vacated.

Deshmukh replied that the court's order of expediting the cases against MPs and MLAs would be brought to the notice of the respective courts.

The court then dictated that the respective courts need to close all the cases, where the trials are ongoing, within a month, and judges need to accelerate the process of delivering judgments.

The courts in Maharashtra, Goa, and several other Union territories were advised to deliver judgments within three months in cases where the procedure is stuck at recording the accused’s evidence.

Section 313 of the CrPC requires a court to question the accused person generally on the case after the prosecution's evidence has been presented, and before the defence is called. The purpose is to allow the accused to explain incriminating evidence against them, which is a critical part of a trial.

The bench also directed that in cases where an accused is on bail, the trial courts have to ensure that the notices are issued to the accused and a date is fixed at the earliest for the procedure.

It also specified that in cases where the accused are in jail, then the trial courts need not wait for the accused to be brought to court, and their statements under 313 CrPC can be recorded through a video conferencing facility.

In addition, it directed that in cases where the framing of charges is awaited, the trial courts have to endeavour to frame charges against the accused within four weeks.

The state has been directed to hand over an updated status report of all the cases in a month.

The bench will hear the suo motu plea again on December 19.

In 2021, the Supreme Court directed all high courts in the country to examine the pendency and withdrawal of cases against MPs and MLAs and ensure their expeditious disposal. The Bombay High Court had instituted a suo motu PIL to deal with the issue.

The system has been successfully conceptualised, engineered, and deployed to address one of the toughest operational challenges faced by troops in the region, ensuring uninterrupted supply to forward posts routinely cut off by snow, extreme terrain, and unpredictable weather, Defence spokesperson Lt Col Mahendra Rawat said in a statement.

He noted that operations in the unforgiving expanse of the Kameng Himalayas, where sheer barren cliffs and extreme altitude routinely sever vital supply lines, required an innovative solution to sustain troops year-round.

The mono rail system can transport over 300 kg of load in a single run, providing a reliable lifeline to remote posts that lack any other mode of communication or supply.

ADAPTING. INNOVATING. EXCELLING — KAMENG HIMALAYAS @16,000 FT.



In a remarkable display of innovation at 16,000 ft, #GajrajCorps has successfully improvised and developed an in-house High Altitude Mono Rail System to enhance operational capability in high-altitude areas. This… pic.twitter.com/6iK5bj9Gm4 — Gajraj Corps - Indian Army (@GajrajCorps_IA) November 13, 2025

Lt Col Rawat said it ensures the smooth movement of mission-critical stores, ammunition, rations, fuel, engineering equipment, and other heavy or awkward loads across steep, unstable gradients where traditional transport methods often fail.

The system is operational day and night and functions with or without escort, during hail or storm, irrespective of weather conditions, he added.

Beyond its logistics role, the mono rail has also demonstrated potential for rapid casualty evacuation, offering a safe alternative in areas where helicopter evacuation may be impossible and foot evacuation is slow and dangerous.

Describing the initiative as a testament to the ingenuity and adaptability of the Gajraj Corps, Lt Col Rawat said the in-house innovation enhances operational readiness, strengthens sustainability in isolated posts, and underscores the Army's commitment to delivering practical, mission-focused solutions in some of the country's most challenging terrains.

The commission issued notice cancelling the Indian Medical Register (IMR) and the National Medical Register (NMR) of the doctors - Muzaffar Ahmad, Adeel Ahmad Rather, Muzamil Shakeel and Shaheen Saeed - with immediate effect.

The doctors ""can no longer practice medicine or hold any medical appointment anywhere in India"", the notice states.

According to the NMC's order, the cancellations were triggered by evidence shared by the Jammu and Kashmir Police and the J&K and Uttar Pradesh Medical Councils, which found the doctors ""prima facie involved"" in a terror-linked case centred on a trans-regional module.

""Inconsistent With Medical Ethics""

The NMC said the alleged conduct of the four doctors was ""inconsistent with the standards of integrity, propriety and public trust expected of the medical profession.""

Three of the doctors - Muzaffar Ahmad, Adeel Ahmad Rather and Muzamil Shakeel - were first stripped of their registration by the Jammu and Kashmir Medical Council. The Uttar Pradesh Medical Council separately flagged Shaheen Saeed's involvement. The NMC's national order enforces these cancellations across the country.

All State Medical Councils have been asked to update their records and ensure that none of the four continue practising under any circumstances.

Part Of Jaish Terror Group

The action comes days after the J&K Police revealed details of a sophisticated network involving medical professionals.

According to the police, the main suspect, a subordinate of the victim at the same company, allegedly plotted the murder out of rage after the latter repeatedly expressed his intention to befriend his live-in partner.

The victim, Sonpal, a native of Uttar Pradesh's Mathura, lived as a tenant in Khoh village in Gurugram and worked in a private company in Industrial Model Township (IMT), Manesar.

The body was recovered on Thursday from the Kosi Kalan area near Mathura after the main accused revealed its location. The accused were identified as Kushalpal Singh alias Kaushal (26), resident of Kaimthal village in Uttar Pradesh Gonda district -- the main suspect -- and his live-in partner Bhavna (19), resident of Prahladpur village in Kasganj. They were living together in an accommodation in Sector 1 of IMT Manesar, officials said.

On October 7, the brother-in-law of the victim filed a missing persons complaint, saying that on October 4, Sonpal went to the office at 9 am. He sent a message to his sister on her phone saying he would come home around 4:30 pm and they would leave for Mathura henceforth.

However, Sonpal did not return, and his phone was found to be switched off, the complaint said. Following a preliminary investigation, the police suspected a case of murder and arrested the main accused, Kushalpal from Pachgaon on Thursday, and Bhawna from Manesar on Friday.

According to the police, during interrogation, the accused confessed to the crime and revealed that Sonpal had repeatedly asked Kushalpal if he could befriend Bhawna. Infuriated by this, the accused hatched a plot to eliminate Sonpal.

On October 4, both the accused took Sonpal to Mathura on a motorcycle stolen by Kushalpal from Panchgaon in July. When they reached Kosi Kalan near Mathura via the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway, they hit Sonpal on the head with a helmet.

After this, Kushalpal killed Sonpal by stabbing him over seven times with a knife in his neck before the duo fled the scene, leaving the body, the police said. Police have recovered a knife, a helmet, a bike, and the ID card and bag of the victim from the possession of the accused, they said, adding that the couple is being interrogated.

The actor-singer-politician's poor show is in line with that of his party, which has won only 25 seats despite contesting 143 - the highest among the major parties.

Khesari Yadav, aka Shatrughan Yadav, had found himself at the centre of a controversy in the run-up to the Bihar elections with a statement on the Ram Mandir.

""Will I become a teacher, professor, or officer after studying at the Ram Temple? No. The Ram Temple is a matter of faith, which is a different matter. But work must be done for education. The country runs on education,"" the 39-year-old had said.

Defending the statement on the first day of polling on November 6, Yadav said his intention was never to hurt anyone's religious sentiments but to stress the importance of education.

""I have built that house with great hard work. I don't know what God wants; everything is going wrong with me... Will I become a Master or Professor after studying in Ram Mandir? Devotion is a different matter. Education is important; through education, you can run a country. Build a temple, build a mosque, but also work for the future of children. Will we vote for Trump for that? No. I stand by my statement,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

He had also countered attacks from rivals about what they had called vulgarity in his songs. Admitting that some of them were a ""mistake"", Yadav said they were not what had caused Bihar's problems with employment and education.

""As a musician, I don't feel bad at all. There is nothing wrong in music. I did that for the entertainment of people. I did not understand much. But that is music, and this is development. Chapra is not facing waterlogging due to my vulgar songs. Is the education system broken due to my vulgar songs? Is the condition of hospitals dismal because of my vulgar songs? This is a different subject, and my songs are a different subject,"" he had said.

TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said Modi's remark that ""just as the Ganga flows from Bihar to Bengal, the BJP's victory will flow there too"", betrayed a ""poor understanding of Bengal's political chemistry"".

""People of Bengal have repeatedly rejected BJP's politics of hate. The BJP's dream of conquering the state is an illusion, like a tortoise wanting to lie on its back. And waiting for them is the Bengal Tigress - Mamata Banerjee,"" Ghosh told reporters, adding, ""The Bihar chemistry will not work here. In Bengal, Banerjee is the commander."" Taking aim at Modi's allegation of ""jungle raj"" in Bengal, Ghosh said, ""There is no 'jungle raj' in Bengal. Jungle raj existed during the Left era. Government data shows Bengal is one of the safest states. From Kashmir to Delhi, the crime graphs show where 'jungle raj' really is."" He cited the Unnao, Hathras and Prayagraj cases in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh to argue that ""'jungle raj' is when rape survivors' families are attacked, when convicts walk out of jail with garlands"".

""Let the prime minister look there before sermonising Bengal,"" he added.

Ghosh said Modi was ""yet to learn lessons from the defeats of 2021 and 2024"", asserting that the verdict in 2026 would be no different.

""You lost the Assembly polls, you lost in the panchayats, and you lost Lok Sabha seats even after camping here. TMC gained seats. In 2026, Mamata Banerjee will become chief minister for a fourth straight term with over 250 seats,"" he said.

Mocking Modi's comparison of Bihar and Bengal, he remarked, ""The Bihar equation does not apply here. In Bihar you fought Congress-type parties. But in Bengal, the TMC has prepared counters for every allegation. Let Modiji keep this fantasy talk inside the pocket of his ten-lakh-rupee jacket."" Accusing the BJP of insulting Bengal's ethos, Ghosh said the party had ""blocked 100 days' wages, stalled housing funds, maligned the Bengali language, and even suggested that Bengali-speaking girls should be sent to Bangladesh"".

""The BJP, by insulting Bengalis and Bengal, is inviting a democratic response. And in 2026 the BJP will win even fewer seats, they may even lose Opposition status,"" he said.

""Bengal will answer through democracy."" Modi, addressing BJP workers at the party headquarters after the NDA's sweeping victory in Bihar, had said the mandate had ""cleared the path"" for a BJP triumph in the neighbouring state and vowed to ""throw out 'jungle raj' from West Bengal as well"".

It's the placeholder icon for a “missing image.”

But have you ever wondered why this scene came to be universally adopted?

As a scholar of environmental humanities, I pay attention to how symbols of wilderness appear in everyday life.

The little mountain icon – sometimes with a sun or cloud in the background, other times crossed out or broken – has become the standard symbol, across digital platforms, to signal something missing or something to come. It appears in all sorts of contexts, and the more you look for this icon, the more you'll see it.

You click on it in Microsoft Word or PowerPoint when you want to add a picture. You can purchase an ironic poster of the icon to put on your wall. The other morning, I even noticed a version of it in my Subaru's infotainment display as a stand-in for a radio station logo.

So why this particular image of the mountain peaks? And where did it come from?

Arriving At The Same Solution

The placeholder icon can be thought of as a form of semiotic convergence, or when a symbol ends up meaning the same thing in a variety of contexts. For example, the magnifying glass is widely understood as “search,” while the image of a leaf means “eco-friendly.”

It's also related to something called “convergent design evolution,” or when organisms or cultures – even if they have little or no contact – settle on a similar shape or solution for something.

In evolutionary biology, you can see convergent design evolution in bats, birds and insects, which all utilise wings but developed them in their own ways. Stilt houses emerged in various cultures across the globe as a way to build durable homes along shorelines and riverbanks. More recently, engineers in different parts of the world designed similar aeroplane fuselages independent of one another.

For whatever reason, the little mountain just worked across platforms to evoke open-ended meanings: Early web developers needed a simple shorthand way to present that something else should or could be there.

Depending on context, a little mountain might invite a user to insert a picture in a document; it might mean that an image is trying to load, or is being uploaded; or it could mean an image is missing or broken.

Down The Rabbit Hole On A Mountain

But of the millions of possibilities, why a mountain?

In 1994, visual designer Marsh Chamberlain created a graphic featuring three colourful shapes as a stand-in for a missing image or broken link for the web browser Netscape Navigator. The shapes appeared on a piece of paper with a ripped corner. Though the paper with the rip will sometimes now appear with the mountain, it isn't clear when the square, circle and triangle became a mountain.

Users on Stack Exchange, a forum for developers, suggest that the mountain peak icon may trace back to the “landscape mode” icon on the dials of Japanese SLR cameras. It's the feature that sets the aperture to maximise the depth of field so that both the foreground and background are in focus.

The landscape scene mode – visible on many digital cameras in the 1990s – was generically represented by two mountain peaks, with the idea that the camera user would intuitively know to use this setting outdoors.

Another insight emerged from the Stack Exchange discussion: The icon bears a resemblance to the Microsoft XP wallpaper called “Bliss.” If you had a PC in the years after 2001, you probably recall the rolling green hills with blue sky and wispy clouds.

The stock photo was taken by National Geographic photographer Charles O'Rear. It was then purchased by Bill Gates' digital licensing company Corbis in 1998. The empty hillside in this picture became iconic through its adoption by Windows XP as its default desktop wallpaper image.

Mountain Riddles

“Bliss” became widely understood as the most generic of generic stock photos, in the same way the placeholder icon became universally understood to mean “missing image.” And I don't think it's a coincidence that they both feature mountains or hills and a sky.

Mountains and skies are mysterious and full of possibilities, even if they remain beyond grasp.

Consider Japanese artist Hokusai's “36 Views of Mount Fuji,” which was his series of paintings from the 1830s – the most famous of which is probably “The Great Wave off Kanagawa,” where a tiny Mount Fuji can be seen in the background. Each painting features the iconic mountain from different perspectives and is full of little details; all possess an ambience of mystery.

I wouldn't be surprised if the landscape icon on those Japanese camera dials emerged as a minimalist reference to Mount Fuji, Japan's highest mountain. From some perspectives, Mount Fuji rises behind a smaller incline. And the Japanese photography company Fujifilm even borrowed the namesake of that mountain for their brand.

The enticing aesthetics of mountains also reminded me of the environmental writer Gary Snyder's 1965 translation of Han Shan's “Cold Mountain Poems.” Han Shan – his name literally means “Cold Mountain” – was a Chinese Buddhist poet who lived in the late eighth century. “Shan” translates as “mountain” and is represented by the Chinese character 山, which also resembles a mountain.

Han Shan's poems, which are little riddles themselves, revel in the bewildering aspects of mountains:

Cold Mountain is a house

Without beams or walls.

The six doors left and right are open

The hall is a blue sky.

The rooms are all vacant and vague.

The east wall beats on the west wall

At the center nothing.

The mystery is the point

I think mountains serve as a universal representation of something unseen and longed for – whether it's in a poem or on a sluggish internet browser – because people can see a mountain and wonder what might be there.

The placeholder icon does what mountains have done for millennia, serving as what the environmental philosopher Margaret Grebowicz describes as an object of desire. To Grebowicz, mountains exist as places to behold, explore and sometimes conquer.

The placeholder icon's inherent ambiguity is baked into its form: Mountains are often regarded as distant, foreboding places. At the same time, the little peaks appear in all sorts of mundane computing circumstances. The icon could even be a curious sign of how humans can't help but be “nature-positive,” even when on computers or phones.

This small icon holds so much, and yet it can also paradoxically mean that there is nothing to see at all.

Viewing it this way, an example of semiotic convergence becomes a tiny allegory for digital life writ large: a wilderness of possibilities, with so much just out of reach.

Kumari got 1,04,861 votes, finishing 25,856 votes ahead of her nearest competitor, RJD's Ritu Priya Chaudhary.

Jitan Ram Manjhi's daughter-in-law, Deepa Kumari's main rival, Ritu Priya Chaudhary of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), secured 79,005 votes, whereas Dr. Ajeet Kumar of the Jan Suraaj Party finished with 11,912 votes.

The results, declared after 29 rounds of counting, reflected a one-sided contest, with all other candidates trailing by extremely large margins.

Once a Naxal-affected area, Imamganj has struggled with underdevelopment for decades. Located near the Bihar-Jharkhand border, it plays a vital role in transit and trade between the two states. The local economy primarily depends on agriculture, with major crops including rice, maize, wheat, and pulses.

Imamganj also holds historical significance as part of the ancient Magadha region, once the epicentre of early Indian civilisation. Its proximity to Bodh Gaya, one of the world's most revered Buddhist pilgrimage sites, further enhances its cultural significance.

While Naxal activities in South Bihar once posed significant challenges, the security situation has improved considerably in recent years. The constituency also has a substantial Muslim population, and with the seat reserved for Scheduled Castes, social dynamics play a decisive role in determining electoral outcomes.

Deepa Kumari, as the NDA candidate, represented the seat since 2024, when she won a by-election by a margin of 5,945 votes over RJD's Raushan Kumar after the seat was vacated by Jitan Ram Manjhi's move to national politics.

In the 2010 Bihar Assembly elections, Uday Narain Choudhary of the Janata Dal (United) defeated Raushan Kumar of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) by a narrow margin of 1,211 votes, securing 44,126 votes against Kumar's 42,915.

In 2015, Jitan Ram Manjhi, chief of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), registered a decisive victory, defeating Uday Narain Choudhary of the RJD by a margin of 29,408 votes. Manjhi polled 79,389 votes, while Choudhary received 49,981.

Manjhi successfully retained the seat in 2020, though his victory margin narrowed to 16,034 votes against the same opponent, Uday Narain Choudhary of the RJD.

Meanwhile, according to the Election Commission, as of now, the BJP has won 55 seats and is leading in 35. The JDU has won 33, LJP (RV) has won 7, and HAM has won 1.

The RJD has also won 8 seats and is leading on 17 others. The Congress has won 1, AIMIM 4, CPI (ML)(L) 1 and CPI(M) 1.

The NDA's performance in Bihar can be attributed to the strong show by major parties like the BJP and JD(U), with comprehensive support from Chirag Paswan's LJP(RV) and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcha.

It's worth noting that Bihar recorded a historic 67.13% voter turnout, the highest since 1951, with women voters outnumbering men (71.6% vs 62.8%).

Jon Ruben, 76, was arrested in July 2025 after eight children and one adult fell ill at Stathern Lodge.

He pleaded guilty to 17 charges at Leicester crown court on Friday. They include sexual assault of a child under 13, assault of a child under 13 by penetration, eight counts of child cruelty, three counts of making indecent images of children, and four drugs charges.

Ruben, from Ruddington in Nottinghamshire, denied one of the sexual offences he was charged with against a nine-year-old boy. Prosecutors have been given two weeks to consider if they will proceed with this charge.

The prosecutor Mary Prior KC told the court that Ruben had run a holiday camp for at least 27 years and “there is a long history of children feeling sick at the camp over many years”.

She added: “For many years he has played what he calls a sweet game with the children in which he goes into the bedrooms. The game is that each has to eat really sticky sweets as quickly as they can but they must chew them.

“Children have always felt ill the next day but he explained it as they were overwrought.”

Ruben was remanded in custody until a further hearing at the same court later this month.
